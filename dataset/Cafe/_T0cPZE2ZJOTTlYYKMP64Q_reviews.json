The Mac and cheese that came with the platter tasted a little stale though, but as a side dish it worked out okay. I would recommend getting the roti instead - it comes out hot, with a substantial filling, and is really satisfying to eat. \n\nWould love to come back to try the juices or pastries - they have a pretty big assortment on the menu!"

However, the food was good and they have a wide variety of assorted breads and desserts available and on display which make for a delicious snack."

I've been there on a Friday or Saturday when all they have left is stewed chicken. I drive from fishtown area and it's worth it!!

The lack of good Caribbean restaurants in philly is a recurring disappointment.  that being said I was happy to find this place. The Roti skin is flavorful, not too doughy or chewy and just the right amount of flaky.  The chicken inside was well seasoned and for only $6 you definitely get a good amount for the price. I've had it twice so far and definitely plan on returning next time I get a hankering. \n\nHaven't tried their baked goods yet but I have my eye on their currant rolls. \n\nAlso, Roti is traditionally made with the meat left on the bone so please ignore other reviewers complaining about that. It adds to the experience as you also get to enjoy the sauces that the bones soak up."

They also have roti with all different meats including shrimp and \"soya\" and other standard West Indian fare like curry goat, collard greens, etc.  Plates of those things range in price and size from about $5 up.  I am giving 4 stars just because doubles I've had in the past were a little more substantial, and they could have been spicier (though they were well-spiced, just not hot). The thing I was most disappointed by was  the subpar ginger-pineapple juice I got for $3.  $3!?  But I think that was more my fault than theirs.\n\nbtw this is a storefront bakery setup with a window in the back with the hot dishes to order.  There are a couple of tables in there too but it's not a nice-lunch-out sort of place."

Namely, my friends are all throwing me a pity party, and J offered to take me out to lunch to this little cafe.  She promised me mind-blowing food.\n\nI had never had Trini cuisine before, so I didn't know what to expect, but I was excited.  We bounced through the modest front, past the pastry cases and tried to order doubles.\n\nWhat we quickly found out is that what food on the menu is available here varies a lot by time and day of the week.  Undaunted, we decided to wait a half hour for the rotis and ordered two vegetable pastries for 1.50$ each.  SCORE!  The dough was clearly baked in-house.  The vegetables were seasoned well and tasty, but I just can't get my mind off of that dough.\n\nAfter finding out all my carnivore options had bones, I chickened out and ordered a soya roti.\n\nHold the phones.\n\nThis sandwich?, which is deceptively tiny, is served in aluminum wrapper.  You split it open, stare longingly at it and dive right in, probably burning your mouth in the process.  BUT DEAR GOD.  This roti was popping with chickpeas and soya, which had the taste and texture of meat.  The spices!  I have no idea what they were!  They were great!  AND AGAIN THE DOUGH.  It was so filling and wonderful and delicious.  Ask for the yellow goopy hot sauce, and use it sparingly -- it has a great flavor too, but it has a slow, long, loooong burn.\n\nWe met the chef (she plopped down in the booth behind us with a Coke) and chattered about her cooking process, and everyone was patient with our fumbling and my baby \"wah wah bones\" shtick.\n\nBy the way, I was STUFFED, STUUUUUUFFED, like couldn't move stuffed.\n\nDropped a star only because of restricting what fudz we could get, which I totally understand as a logistical thing, but these are my reviews, and I get to be arbitrary and unfair.  Also, the prices of drinks are a leeeetle high."

Brown Sugar made a compelling argument to me that not only is such a thing possible, but that is desirable. Similarly, I knew that in the Caribbean South Asian cuisine could mix with African and South American cuisines into something original and delightful. I had had chapatis. I had had thick African stews. I was familiar with jerk chicken. But a roti, a delightful, substantial combination of all three? Amazing! \n\nI have no real basis to compare Brown Sugar with other Trini food, but for 6 bucks you can do a lot worse than a chicken or goat roti."

If you want hot food, order at the window at the back, and for bakery items, order at the case. Watch out for the Black Cake, a specialty soaked in rum, that is only available during the Holidays. \n\nThis is a real neighborhood joint run be real folks celebrating their culture and their customers.

And don't plan on dining in, because they only have as many tables as two-face has faces.\n\nThe Ugly: Their smoothies are named after diseases they are intended to cure. You will find this either uniquely cute or strangely off-putting... Menstrual Cramp Smoothie, anyone?\n\nUltimately, a fantastic meal that will fill you up without making you feel like you just ingested a cinderblock!

There used to be a nice young guy but I can never catch him. My father is Trini and has been bringing me here since I was child. For the past 2 years it's sad to watch its decline. They rotate cooks in and out so the food is hit or miss. They never have any baked goods. In fact, the entire \"bakery\" area is deplorable and empty. I go specifically for Roti because this is the only place I know in philly that makes them well enough to eat. It's hard to bring myself to come here with such bad service!"

Saturdays they have shrimp rotis - really good, large and full of shrimp. I recommend calling ahead and making sure they're open. We recently visited at 1pm on a Sunday and the place was closed. Very frustrating because we made a 25 min drive there, but there may be covid hours we were not aware of."

Better than a flour tortilla, by far. \n\nI generally get either goat roti, or \"soya\" (imitation meat) roti. The goat roti HAS BONES IN IT, so be forewarned. That being said, it so very, very good. Marrowy and rich and spicy.\n\nThe \"soya\" is, quite simply the best imitation meat I've ever eaten. It comes in a number of varieties, all good. For the roti, i'd go with the chunks. However,  the \"chicken\" drumstick is jaw-droppingly good. My wife and I debated for a good 4-5 bites over whether it was meat or not. \n\nAlso, they sell tiny bottles of various Carribean wine drinks in their refrigerator case that I am too scarred to try, because of being lame.\n\nPatronize this establishment, or I will do it for you!"

It's a little confusing because you order at one window and pay at another, and if you want a beef patty,  cocoa bread, or any other baked item then you have to order at the front of the store.  Other than that, the food was delicious and affordable."

Its best restaurant and bakery in Philadelphia is located on the 52nd Street shopping area of West Philadelphia.  This establishment called Brown Sugar Caf\u00e9 & Bakery is the real deal.\n\nThere are so many choices here representing all the highlights of Trinidadian culinary traditions.  On a recent visit here I started with the famous Doubles and added on to that a Trinidadian beef patty and the well-known street food Pholourie served with tamarind chutney. All were excellent but the beef patty was exceptional.  I could have eaten a dozen of these.  For dessert I thoroughly enjoyed a moist and flavorful Guava Pone and a wonderful Currant Roll.\n\nThe staff here were friendly and helpful ... and I can't think of anything not to like about the fine Trinidadian eatery called Brown Sugar."

However, after asking my friends who are from the area-- no one seemed to know where I could satisfy this craving. \n\nAfter doing some research.... I found Brown Sugar, opened up the Yelp app and decided to give it a try. I'm very happy I did! \n\nI ordered the Curry Chicken Roti to-go. I watched as the lady behind the counter meticulously made my Roti. First the wrap, then the filling, followed by the Curry Chicken. \nAll for $7.50! \n\nIt was immaculately clean and the staff was friendly. Would definitely recommend you try it out!"

Went about a week ago, and they had no roti skins, so I settled for a small dinner. No peas and rice, so I got veggie, and no stew beef, so I got stew chicken. Rice was ok, chicken was rubbery, and the cabbage was pretty good. When I get a shrimp roti from there I'll update, but best shrimp roti is in BK."

I was very excited because they offer vegan desserts. And the cake really shocked us, it was quite moist and flavorful, more so than our dinner! we wished we had gotten another slice or two; but quite THANKFUL 4 what we had!\n\nOk, fast forward to today: the food was quite blah! tried the vegan carrot cake which tasted like someone poured their perfume in it. the plantain were not ripe and more like chips. the soya roti, well, it just  added disappointment to ourselves after traveling to 3 different festivals that weren't FESTIVE AT ALL with three hungry small children looking and hoping for good food and vibrations.... \n\npeace & libations"
