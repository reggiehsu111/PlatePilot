My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild, even if you like really spicy food. It's not because it's super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat, the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis, I've had the mango, rose, and mint - all I would recommend."

Its been ages I had such a perfect chaat... Spice, taste and innovation all came together. Must say, have never had such a chaat even in India. \nI wish we had one in Milwaukee. We will make more trips to Philli again to eat in ur cafe, Hasan Saab! :)"

There is one guy behind the counter who spent a while asking me what sorts of food I liked and what spice I can handle.  I asked him to explain all of the ingredients and he went through them one by one.  It was very informative and interesting, and I appreciated his excitement and knowledge about the different flavors and combinations.\n\nWe eventually decided on the crazy chaat, a blend of a lot of chaats.  I say \"we\" decided because he took my feedback - and perhaps my mood - into account.  I would venture to say the chaat was life-changing, but I'm also a huge fan of Indian food and chaat so count that as my bias.  In any event, because of the good vibes of this place and the ridiculously delicious food, I will surely be back."

If you're in the area, Mood Cafe is definitely the better out of the two. Depending on how busy they are, they will walk you through what exactly each chaat is (and what chaat is if you've never had it), and will make recommendations for whether you are craving something spicy, savory, sweet, etc. I've stuck to the lamb and beef chaats, but all of them are pretty tasty. Customer service definitely prevails on this one."

I usually bring a gluten free chaat back for my boyfriend, and while I'm not a big fan of chaat in general because of its spices I do enjoy nibbling a few bites off his plate, since all the ingredients are crispy and fresh. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is that it's slow sometimes to get your order when there's a line, because there is only one employee and he painstakingly makes each order by hand (and with a smile!), so it sometimes gets me a bit impatient..but I would not compromise the fantastic service for all the quickness in the world, because that's what makes this place so great!"

Just let the owner, Hasan, know it's your first time. He'll work with you to create a \"simple\" chaat for your liking.\n\n\"Simple\" only being a relative term. I'm not sure I ever had a meal with so many flavors. And not only that, but they all worked together so well. If it was as simple as warming up some chicken and randomly throwing in a handful of a bunch of spices, Philly would be full of 5 star restaurants. Mood cafe has chaats down to a dime. It's quick, relatively healthy and filling too. 5 stars as far as I'm concerned. \n\nHasan will also refuse to take your money unless you are satisfied with your meal. He's well aware of the success of the business, as he showed me his five-star Yelp average on his phone. I don't blame him...after all, its rare for a place with this many reviews to consistently get so many top reviews. And as recent reviews show, Mood Cafe isn't coasting on its Yelp fame by lowering quality. Its a tragedy there isn't a second Mood Cafe in NY, but then again, another location might not be able to retain Mood Cafe's magic (I'm convinced the NY Han Dynasty dandan was subpar compared to Philly locations). I guess I'll have to return when I'm in Philly. Until then, keep up serving delicious chaats, Mood Cafe!\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Definitely worth checking out for the chaats."

You cannot go wrong with that! It's a burst of flavor in your mouth and feels healthy at the same time. I wanted to order mild (because though I like spice, I can't take the heat), but I am glad I went with his recommendation for the medium spice. It was perfect (not too spicy at all)\n\nThe lassi selection here is probably the most extensive I've seen. I ordered a mango and also tried some of my friend's honeydew.

The dining area was clean but sterile, without decor or other touches that could have made it a comfortable place to hang out.  \n\nBut the big problem was that the food was simply disgusting.  I don't like paying at a dining establishment for chicken that has been reheated in the microwave.  And when you reheat chicken that has already been cut into small pieces, it quickly gets rubbery. Add the icy yogurt, and you get one big EWWWWWWW.  The best part of the meal was that the worker behind the counter gladly provided me with a large tap water on ice, at no charge.

Never in my life have I experienced so many flavors and textures in a single dish. Fortunately, the mixture is both delicious and satisfying. The spices deliver just the right kick to pair perfectly with a sweet, cool lassi. I'll be back to try the other chaats. In the end, what really sets Mood Cafe apart is the exceptional service.

We walked through the door and looked up at the menu board and felt a bit overwhelmed. We knew what we wanted but the owner gave us a nice intro into the world of chaats and how he prepares them.  He made us feel welcome and comfortable and we really enjoyed the additional service he provided right off the bat.  Now let's get to the food!\n\nChicken Tikka Salad Chaat:  The chicken was absolutely delicious!  Fresh chicken with the same great tikka taste mixed in with salad greens, chickpeas, cranberries, juicy mango slices, and all of the chaat accessories as the base. It was well worth every penny and every bite just made you want to keep going. Many restaurants that offer chaat have a bland taste and sometimes its either too saucy or their isn't enough of the sauce to coat the chaat but this place had it just right.  I'd highly recommend the chicken tikka chaat or chicken tikka salad chaat for first timers.\n\nPaneer Tikka Chaat:  Spicy, sweet, and tangy at the same time with every bite.  Cranberries with paneer were a great combo and the shredded paneer blended in well with the chaat mixture.   The mixture of sauces were perfect and the crispy chaat pieces were crunchy all the way through the meal.  No sogginess = more taste!\n\nNow for the lassis:\n\nAs someone who is critical of lassis and find that most stores just make glorified smoothies with mounds of sugar, I found the lassis at Mood Cafe rather pleasing.  I ordered the blueberry and peach lassis and both were pleasing.  The blueberry was a bit more tasteful than the peach lassi and I'd highly recommend it for first timers.  The peach was a bit more difficult to taste but it was still a positive experience.  Both lassis had just enough salt and sugar and not overwhelming to a point where you'd feel like you've had enough.  \n\nFinal Conclusion:  The owner is a terrific person who really works hard to please his customers.  He's mastered the chaat world and anyone who wants to experience good chaat and have a positive experience, they should definitely stop by!"

I must have looked lost reading the menu because another customer stopped to offer his recommendations.  Hassan upon learning it was my first time for chaat told me he would explain everything and the menu would only make me more confused.  He spent more than five minutes explaining what a chaat was, how he made it, and the differences between the different menu offerings.  He told me that number 9 was the best place to start for the beginners and asked me my spice preference.  It was really nice that he explained the process and paid careful attention to my preference (when I said I wanted spicy but wasn't sure if that was American spicy or Indian medium he gave me American spicy and put hot sauce on the side so I could customize it).  He told me that he would guide me through the menu and options on subsequent visits.  I really like that he sees it as a 'journey' through food.  We ate at the restaurant; there aren't a ton of seats but a lot of people get take-out so its not an issue.  Hassan brought us small glasses of Banana Fig Lassis so we could try them.  When we had finished the meal he asked how I had liked it and explained how chaat isn't something served in restaurants because of the complexity, variation, and customizable character.  He said each menu option was characteristic of the cuisine of a certain region, but that by no means these were the limit to his food creations.  Hassan truly approaches chaat as an art - it is completely customizable.  He let me try each of the crunch toppings individually so I could get a sense of the ingredients and how chaat is composed. He said you can only find mango lassi at Indian restaurants, but he figured why not have a rose lassi or a passionfruit lassi.  He promised he could make any kind of lassi or milkshake I could think of - which I take as a desirable challenge :)  He even gave me a spoonful of the rose petal jam he uses to make the rose lassi.  He says he makes it out of real rose petals, not just extract so it has real rose flavor.  It was awesome and I'm definitely going to order a rose lassi when I come back.  And for those wondering what chaat is its basically a salad on crack - it has a thousand ingredients, spices, sweet, sour, spicy, salty crunchy, balanced, and fantastic.  I definitely recommend it!  Overall the experience was fantastic as was the food.  Hassan is truly what makes this restaurant special."

He makes an awesome chatt and puts the same awesome love and effort into the next persons  order for a lassie or chatt dish. This place is very well know, the line that I run into on most visits speaks that truth for itself. Pina Colada, Guava Red Watermelon, Apple Banana, Honey, Peanut butter banana, Peaches & Cream and the list goes on, they are all delicious, delicious, delicious.

I've seen him give this spiel half a dozen times (\"a little sweet, a little spicy...\") and he clearly revels in it every time.  I've been in a couple times with my father and he always asks how my \"daddy\" is.  For my fianc\u00e9 and I, a staple of weekends when the weather is nice is stopping into Mood Cafe on the way to Clark Park for a lassi, some chaat, and of course, some great conversation.  \n\nThe menu looks quite complex, but I'm pretty sure the only real differences are the types of meat and how spicy you want it (he always makes mine mild for me), and he basically makes the rest of it up.  The salad chaat is amazing, although don't look for it on the streets of India, as he admits to it being a personal creation.  The lassi choices are also a bit overwhelming, but don't worry, you can't go wrong.  Personally I love the honey papaya.  If you order mint, he will go pick it from where he is growing it under a tree outside.  And always expect Hasan to give you a second cup with what wouldn't fit into the first cup, because that's just the kind of guy he is."

I must admit I was apprehensive, but once I tried it it was quite good. I had the Kunna lamb Chaat and my wife had the Chicken Keema. We also had a Lychee Lassi and a Date Almond Lassi, along with a sample of one that had strawberry in it. Only downside is this place is a bit of a hole-in-the-wall with very little seating.

Both were 5 worthy and dollar for dollar will fill you up!  The lamb was the best in terms of flavor.  I also tried the multi berry, blueberry and pistachio/almond lassies and the latter was the best but all were fantastic.  Their website only has a fraction of what is actually offered.

I'm partial to the mint flavor. Also the plain sweetened lassi is surprisingly good. \n\nI enjoyed the chaat but it's not something I order regularly. I find the menu a little confusing - there's no explanation as to what the ten different kinds of chaat listed on the chalk board consist of. Some kind of printed menu with in depth ingredient descriptions would be handy. It's not that the owner wouldn't be happy to explain everything to you, it's just that I like to have something I can look at while I decide what to order.

Like many other Yelpers, I first discovered Mood Cafe while wandering down Baltimore Ave looking at Yelp, and seeing the 5 star rating, I knew I had to try it. When I walked in and told Hassan I wanted a specific dish (from the large blackboard filled with goodies) he made sure I knew what Chaat was (I did not), then explained (he always explains it as a mixture of sweet, spicy, all these flavors together. Which seems to open up more questions than answers, but I do not complain). The combination was incredible. I spent the next few days dreaming of returning again. And I did again, and again. Delicious, yes. But it is so affordable that it can actually be a regular hangout ($6.99 for veg chaat!). \n\nOne piece of advice, don't bother going for the meat Chaat. They are equally good, but more expensive and take longer. And I am generally partial to meat myself."

A meal consisting of mangos, dates, dried cranberries, chickpeas, potatoes, and some other delicious combination of ingredients placed into a meal. You can have this as a salad or a regular meal. The meal was placed on top of fresh spring mix. Normally served with yogurt but he knew not to include it. For meat eaters they had plenty of options to go along with this as well, lamb, chicken, and beef. \n\nDon't forget to order one of their lassi drinks as well.

I had to click on it-- 100 reviews and 5 stars on Yelp? It seemed too good to be true. I immediately contacted my friend and told her about the place; she was extremely ready to try it as well.\n\nWe ventured into the restaurant at around 7:20 PM. The place is fairly small-- there are only about 3-4 tables. The man who owns the place was incredibly warm, sweet and welcoming. We mentioned that we were newcomers and he immediately wanted to make sure we had a good experience with the food. He asked us for spice preferences and meat preferences for my friend (I told him I was vegetarian from the get-go). The food was made fairly quickly even though there were two parties of four ahead of us. Regardless, the wait time wouldn't make me subtract a star.\n\nThe menu of chaat varieties is extensive; I ordered the veggie chaat (I originally asked for the paneer veggie chaat, but he was out of paneer. Next itme!) The quality of the food was absolutely incredible. The combinations of flavors made each bite exciting and different. The chutneys mixed with the yogurt sauce, the fresh bits of mango pieces, raisins and chick peas and crispy flakes/puris added a cool texture to the dish as well. The play on sweet and savory was so on point. At the end of our meal, the owner told everyone in the restaurant (all tables were full so perhaps about 12 people) that he was heating up gulab jamun (indian sweet) for everyone on the house-- my friend and I were just about to leave and we were so full, but the thought was incredibly sweet and it just added to our experience. Another thing I noticed was that while we were eating, he announced to everyone that he hoped the spices were correct-- he mentioned being able to \"fix it up right away\" if someone had a dish with a spice level that wasn't ideal. So cute! So much appreciation! \n\nThe restaurant also had a huge menu for lassi flavors. I'm not a huge lassi fan, but my friend ordered the Date lassi and really enjoyed it. All the other people in the restaurant ordered a lassi as well, so it is probably a worthwhile choice to complement the chaat.\n\nI paid about $6.50 for my weal, and it was so worth it. I have nothing but golden and glittery words of praise for this West Philly gem. I have so many people in mind that I want to introduce to this restaurant."

It's a great balance of rich yogurt, creamy almonds, and nutty pistachios that almost adds an umami flavor to the combination as the pistachios that they use are toasted with a bit of salt. \n\nI've recently ordered off the menu. Pistachio/Dates. Also a winner. The chewy pieces of dates sink to the bottom and wait for you to finish your drink before you can pick them out with a straw. \n\nIt's hard to go wrong here.

I have frequented Desi Chaat House more often because they have more variety of chaat, but Mood Cafe has more lassi options. I really like their lassi because it isn't that sweet, and my favourite is cardamom lassi. It has a slight tanginess from the yoghurt and just the right amount of cardamom flavour. It's actually really refreshing to drink on a very hot day. Mango lassi is very good also, once again with just the right sweetness and enough mango flavour. This time I ordered Kashmiri chaat and asked mine to be medium spicy. I love eating chaat during the summer months because it's refreshing and kind of helps my appetite when you don't want to eat anything. Just in case you don't know, chaat is one of the favourite Indian street food with all kinds of possible combination of veggies, crunchy Indian snacks, fruits, sauces, and yoghurt. The potential of combination seems endless. \n\nMood Cafe is rather small for an eat in. They do have limited chairs and tables. I chose to do a take out (which most times seems more convenient). The service is really friendly and pretty efficient. I think they over made their mango lassi they gave me the extra portion in a small cup!

My boyfriend got lamb, spicy, and I got chicken, medium spice. We also ordered mango and pineapple lassi.\n\nThe lassi was amazing - I don't think I'll ever be content with a smoothie ever again. Mango taste was light and airy, not too sweet, but enough to satisfy any craving. The Pineapple lassi was very refreshing, and offered the perfect blend of flavor and sweetness. Even better, with our lassi we got a little cup with the leftover drink (I'm guessing they made extra), which was perfect for sharing. \n\nWhen I got my chaat, my first instinct was to say \"Eeww, how do these even go together...?\" Radishes, cilantro sauce, mangoes, honeyed dates, chick peas, fried dough strips, chicken pieces, several types of mystery sauce? I then dubiously mixed everything together and took a tentative bite. \n\nIt was an absolute explosion in my mouth, a taste sensation I've never had before. Sweet, sour, savory, salty, spicy, and everything in between - all in perfect balance. Saying that it was delicious would be an understatement. My chicken chaat was seriously awesome, and my boyfriend's lamb chaat was even better. It literally comes down to personal preference what meat/veggie you get, but I don't think you can go wrong.\n\nThis place makes the 2.5 hour drive from Maryland to Penn worth it. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely. The owner is super friendly, helpful, and service-oriented. The food is a mind-blowing culinary experience. My only qualm with this place is that if you don't order a lassi, the serving sizes for the chaat might not be enough to fill you up completely (but since I did order a lassi, I ended up staggering out the door due to how full I was). \n\nThe do offer other awesome desserts like gulab jamun and carrot halwa - I'm currently doing stomach expansion exercises so I can fit those as well next time I'm around."

I've been here twice -- the first time Hassan made all the yummy chaats for my group and let us sample various lassis. He was very personable and asked us for feedback on our chaats as well. The second time I came here, someone else made my chaat. It wasn't as good as when Hassan made it but still great nonetheless. Make sure you get a lassi! They have the best mango lassis I've ever had in my life, made with fresh mango. It's pretty small and quiet, which is great for enjoying yummy food with a few friends."

He was super generous. He gave us a full breakdown of chaat and also of the lassi. The lassi, in my opinion; you can keep it. Truly nothing special, I had the mango. I thought it was good, but nothing I'd go more than 10 blocks for. The chaat however was pretty interesting. Not something I'd see myself craving but very good flavor blend. I personally thought it was a bit sweet for my taste with the dates and what may have been cherries. I think that has mass appeal. My girlfriend had a lamb/ I had chicken. Both chaat's were filling and tasty and the ambience was actually pretty cool. Maybe I'll stop back again, but probably not grooving its way into my standbys anytime soon."

I had to see it, smell it, and taste it to believe it.\n\nFood (9.5/10) = As someone had mentioned in their review, forget the chalkboard menu, which by the way is a bit overwhelming.  Let the Hassan work his magic.  I had no idea what chaat was, but whatever it was, Yelp told me it was crazy delicious.  I informed Hasaan this was my first trip to this place, and wanted something with chicken.  With just that info, the alchemist proceeded to construct my chaat.  The product was very colorful.  Every bite had a different flavor, owing to the multiple layers of different ingredients.  Different textures (soft, crunchy, etc.)  Different flavors (sweet, salty, etc.).  Incredible.  I was informed that the chaat he would make for me is \"basic,\" and on my next trip he would go \"crazy with the next chaat.\"  My next visit?  This guy already knew I would come back! The man has full confidence in his product.  \n\nI also got the kiwi lassi.  I've had lassi before, but never liked it.  However, since it was a frequently mentioned item on yelp, I decided to go for it again.  Happy that I did.  Despite that my kiwi lassi, is not traditional, I enjoyed it a lot more than the other stuff I had in the past that were supposedly more traditional.  The kiwi tartness was not overwhelming, but well balanced.  \n\nAmbiance (8.5/10) = Bright cool environment.  There are a couple of benches against the windows for people to sit and eat.  \n\nService (10/10) = As many mentioned already, Hassan is awesome and super friendly.  Telling you his story about chaat and his approach to his food and this little shop. \n\nOverall opinion = I am now a believer of the 5 yelp stars.

After awhile, my mind starting asking, \"Why haven't you gone to Mood Cafe?\" So, I finally took these thoughts out of my mind and tried to get my wife to go. At first, she was a skeptic and did not want to go. On my third attempt, she finally gave me the why not approval.\n\nAfter going, we both should be asking, what is wrong with us. This place Amaze! It looks like a small place with not much to offer. The two main menu items are Lassis and Chaat. I've had a Lassi before, and it's always been Mango. But this place had like 25 Lassi flavors. But what is a Chaat I wondered?\n\nThe owner who was working there on our visit explained. There is so much that goes into a Chaat, he lost me somewhere along the way. But what was not lost was my intrigue. I go the Crazy Chicken Chaat. The crazy was their way of saying it's a chicken and beef combo. The beef reminded me of taco meat, but the kind that is seasoned extremely well.\n\nWatching him make the Chaat was like watching an artist. It was like Jackson Pollack at work with the piling on so much stuff. A threw a bunch of stuff down. Then he added 3-4 sauces. He threw more stuff down. Added more sauces. And then he threw more stuff down. Not sure I remember it all, but there was mango, almonds, crispy noodles, dates, potato, and, and, and... yeah that's what I remember. But I know there was more.\n\nWhen I put this goodness in my mouth, it was like a party of flavors. It tasted so fresh and nothing like anything I had tasted before. I was in love.\n\nI also had a peach Lassi which was excellent. My wife had the same dish as me, but got the blueberry Lassi. I liked her Lassi even better.\n\nI so am going back to this place.

I'm not sure whether that's what a \"chaat\" actually calls for but I would have preferred less of it, personally (not too into fried dough as a meal). But if that's your thing go for it."

That's the very first ingredient in a chaat. So nothing is authentic and nothing tastes like a chaat. I'll give them props for adding keema, chicken, lamb to make it different but no chickpeas in a chaat is like no tuna in a tuna salad/melt. Those of you who have never had a chaat should go as you can't do the comparison and don't known what you're missing. Don't order mango shake. It's nasty. It's not a real mango.

And there were lots of things in it with a delicious sauce(s). We each ordered lassies, and ofcourse never had those either. We understand some enjoy them salty? But we ordered a coconut lassie, and a pineapple lassie, creamy.. Light... Cool. Think it's yogurt and milk really?

He gave us 100% guarantee and that if we don't like anything, he will make us something else until we are happy. \n\nI was open-minded so I pretty much left it to the owner to prepare my chaat. All I had an input in was which type of meat and if I like it spicy. I'll let the pictures speak for itself of what he prepared for us. The BF had the beef and it was seasoned a bit spicy than I had expected. Not fire hot but definitely not bland. Even though it's a 'salad', the portions were huge. The picture may not look like it but we were full and actually didn't finish it. I appreciate the extra gesture of giving us the remaining lassi in another cup. Nothing was wasted!  I noticed there was a steady stream of customers after 8pm. Seems like most stopped in after dinner in the area to grab a drink to go."

After a particularly bad experience with customer service today, I immediately thought of Mood Caf\u00e9. Not because it`s bad!, but because the owner is so kind, and the food is wonderful.\n\nMy favorite is samosa chaat with a mango lassi. The last time I was in I was tried the rose lassi and it is just so good! Everything here is fresh, the flavors are clean and vibrant. I have nothing but praise for Mood Caf\u00e9."

We chose to do take-out and after I got back home,I realized that they cut down the portion so much...I used to eat one bowl for two meals, now I bearly feel full with this one bowl. Whattt??? I really feel so disappointed to be honest...hopefully they can provide the same quantity as they do before. I told so many friends about this place, and I want see this place be better and better!"

For the sake of full disclosure, my taste buds were certainly adjusting to chaat as I was at Mood. It's a strange sensation: the mixing of the hot veggies and meat, the cold yogurt, the crispy wonton shells - all of it crunched up in a bowl. \n\nHasan, the owner and one of the friendliest faces in all of Philadelphia, explained every step of how he prepares and serves the food. Then, for dessert, he prepared a carrot and cream cheese dish, with hot, stewed carrots (naturally sweet) and homemade cheese. It was somehow similar to a pumpkin or sweet potato pastry. \n\nLike other reviewers's experience, I too was blown away by both Hasan's kindness and his restaurant. He remembers faces well, and will prepare you a different kind of dish every time you visit. He promised a different, hot rice and beans dish next time I came. He also assured my girlfriend and I that we would not have to pay if we didn't like the food. However, we loved the chaat and the dessert, and were more than happy to pay every cent (though he didn't charge us for the dessert). Can't wait to go back!"

I had the paneer chaat with an apple fig lassi . The chaat was really good but the lassi was exceptional , this has got to be the closest I have had to the real thing ( try the salt lassi if you have the taste for it , exceptional !!) . Also the owner Hassan is a great host , taking interest in a customer and treating them like a human being there to enjoy food as opposed to just a number to serve a dish too is all the difference between a great place and just another restaurant and the experience I had here was awesome !! I will be back for more chaat and lassi"

The food is always wildly flavorful and so, so satisfying, whether as a summer picnic meal or a light, spicy way to warm up in wintertime.\n\nIf you have any questions or want a recommendation as to what to order, be sure to ask the owner!

A dinner at Mood was the end to an almost magical evening; I have never been so warmly welcomed or felt at home in a food establishment before. New to chaat and lassies, Hassan took out time just before he went on his break to teach us all about how to select a combination we'd like--and within my dietary restrictions. They were incredibly encouraging and so thoughtful--assuring us multiple times that if we didn't like it they'd find something we would enjoy. It was extremely reassuring as the choices were a bit overwhelming for two excited newbies looking to explore.\n\nAs other customers came in Daniel continued to share samples of their lassis--including new ones he made to experiment-- from beet/lemon/ginger to guava to strawberry/coconut/peanut butter. My boyfriend had the Mango (luscious, creamy); I was overjoyed with the insanely clean and sweet coconut. Both tasted incredibly fresh--though mine was more icy than smooth (perfect for the next day after a night in the freezer).\n\nAs for the chaat...it was wonderful! As everyone has noted it's nearly impossible to describe. I have many dietary restrictions (spicy, lactose, fried foods being among them) and was nervous, so chose the paneer. It was very different that I've had in other preparations, but delicious scrambled in combination with the beautifully sweet/salty/savory combinations of mint/raspberry/spicy sauces and I'm not even sure what else. My boyfriend--asking for the most authentic/spicy preparation-- had the chicken tikki (a bit too much sauce, but wonderfully hot).\n\nMood Cafe is a gem-- we stayed for over 2 hours chatting with Daniel and other regulars. We've never had such an incredible experience and the passion both Hassan and Daniel felt for the business and food was contagious. I hope to run my own business with that joy someday."

He explained right off the bat that a chaat is random as hell. The ingredients don't really sound like they go well together and when you see it, it will look very strange. But he promised I'd like it or give me my money back. With that kind of guarantee, I could see why people like him. Since it was his dime, I went ahead and got a lassie too. \n\nThe chicken chaat, although it didn't look very appealing, was pretty good. I can't tell you for the life of me what it tasted it like. It was sweet, salty, savory, spicy, mild, cold, lukewarm, creamy and crunchy all at the same time...just like Hassan said. Every bite tasted different than the preceding.

The food is still good, though, so my advice for reducing cognitive dissonance in experienced chaat-eaters is to come here, eat the food & ignore the fact that they're calling it \"chaat\".\n\nThe chaat here is full of crispy bits, as well as bits of fresh vegetables (radish, onion), nuts, and sauces or chutneys. In addition to the Crazy Chaat I've had before, I also quite like the Punjabi Chaat -- it has the crispy bits and sweetness I like. Samosa chaat was fine; the samosa was warm, soft and comforting, pretty standard.  Shahi chaat has lots of nuts, but the combination of textures didn't suit me.\n\nLassis are good here. I've had rose and cardamom lassis & they were both good.\n\nMood Cafe has great vegetarian options that are good, healthy, and fresh. I highly recommend them!  Be aware that there isn't much seating inside."

FYI make sure to mention gluten free if need be when ordering as they were able to accommodate my party (yay!) also there's like 10000 different types of lassis, which is both good and bad as it might've been a tad too many choices. \n\n(but the PLUS IS THAT THEY HAVE VEGAN ALMOND MILK LASSIS YAY )\n\nOK so the chicken tikka chaat: first glance looks good? first bites ok? then it hits me: where's the chicken even???? oh it's mashed? ok (?) also it was super spicy. the thing that drops this down is that the cilantro chutney was a green that no cilantro is -- it looked like it was dyed :( and so was this other tamarind chutney that was dyed red :( why tho???\n\nalso, the lassi? glad i had an option as it's not always i find almond milk lassis, but as i drank more of the mango lassi it was way too sweet. :(\n\nall in all, for this west coaster and from this region of the world, could be better."

Which is strange because as an Indian, this was the first time I ever had meat in my Chaat. it was absolutely awesome. \n6) If you are unfamiliar with Chaat, just get ready for an explosion of flavor and pure deliciousness of textures and tastes.

We are both vegan and it was nice to see that the lassi menu was clearly labeled that any of them can be made vegan. We asked the friendly owner which of the chaats could be made vegan and he said \"any of them!\" He asked if it was our first time having chaat (it was) and explained what is in it. We asked him for his recommendation and he made us one samosa chaat and one #3 (I forget what it was called). Both were delicious- an interesting mix of sweet, salty, savory and spicy flavors and crunchy and soft textures. We also had a mango lassi and a peach lassi. The peach one was good but the mango was better. We'll definitely be returning for more!"

He said he'll take care of it and asked my boyfriend and I our meat preferences (they had a lot of choices, btw!). I asked for the chicken and my boyfriend went for the beef. I also wanted to try their lassi so he recommended the mango one, he even gave us another one because he was so certain that we were gonna love it! That way we didn't have to share! \n\nBoth the chicken and the beef chaat were amazing! Definitely something new for my taste buds. It was very flavorful and savory, it basically had different tastes every bite I took. I personally liked the chicken better than the beef just because the chaat was so flavorful, and the chicken had less flavor than the beef so it cancels it out. \n\nI also ordered the veggie samosa which was also good but after trying to finish my chicken chaat (which I didn't finish their servings I would say is really good for the price) i couldn't eat any more of the samosa I felt like there were too many flavors going on in my mouth. \n\nBut I will definitely be back mainly because of the outstanding service, and their mango lassi!"

Fortunate for us, Hassan has solved the dilemma: you can mix and match flavors at the uber-delicious and refreshing Mood Cafe. \n\nWant to branch out from the thick, rich, mango lassi but can't decide whether to try mint or honey? Why not get both! I ordered a shaved ice and was tempted yet scared by the idea of rose or sandalwood, though mango and strawberry are options as well. What to do? Shaved ice suicide! All the flavors together, double-rainbow style with fresh fruit layered in! Being from the south, shaved ices are a summer staple, but this is the best shaved ice I have ever (and likely will ever) have. Usually, once it gets all melty I toss out the syrupy liquid. But in Mood Cafe's case, I look around for a straw! Yum!\n\nThere are also plenty of vegan options-Hassan said he can make a coconut milk lassi or milk shake. I'm not a vegan, but that sounds so darn good, I may have to try it...along with about a hundred other things."

The meals are wholesome and like 'home-made meals', especially the daals. The Shami kabobs are excellent!!\nHaving a sweet tooth, the newly added sweets also caught my eye. I tried the ras malai and carrot halwa, and they are delicious!\n\nIn spite of all these additions, one thing is the same - Hassan's enthusiasm and love for what he does. The taste and quality of all his products is consistently good! Its already a regular haunt for me, but with the frequent, new and absolutely lip-smacking additions Hassan is always making, it is a fun trip everytime! Whenever I go there, I have this question - what new, yummy thing will Hassan have today? And I must say, I have never been disappointed!\n------------------------\nComing from the land of chaat and lassis, I must say, I am impressed! I discovered it, right on its second day of existence, and rejoiced to find not just chaats and lassis, but awesome milkshakes, shaved ice and FRESH SQUEEZED juices. So far, I have been here about 5 times, getting something new each time. Usually, I am the kind who sticks to my favorites and is wary of venturing onto something new, but this place has so many tempting options, that you just have to try them. \nThe chaats are quite authentic with all the chaat-imperative sauces and ingredients spot on. I especially love the aloo paapri chaat and the dhokla chaat. \nHassan, the owner, is enthusiastic and is really proud of the products he serves. He especially prides himself on selling fresh juices, which true to the word and absolutely fresh, delicious and refreshing, with no preservatives or sugar, Hassan proudly states. He is generous and gives you samplers the juices ready - the latest addition to the list is grape juice, quite delicious. My favorites are the orange juice and apple juice, with the carrot juice and beet juice following at a close second place.\n\nThe lassis and the milkshakes are divine! My choice would be: the all-berry lassi and the saffron milk-shake (Hassan made me a special one, after I told him that I like cooling flavor of sandalwood too). \n\nGotta go there!"

None of us had the slightest idea about what to order. No problem. The lone man at the counter asked us what meat we preferred, the level of spice we were looking to try, and if there were any sauces we were opposed to. The answers to those three questions produced, for each of us, a magical and absolutely exquisite combination that stunned the group into happy silence. \n\nThe lassi is also phenomenal. We each tried a different flavor--all amazing! Instead of tossing the leftovers, the man at the counter gave us all of the extras in smaller cups so we could sample them from each other. \n\nIf you are anywhere near this place (as in, somewhere within the city limits of Philadelphia) you MUST try the food here.

The lassi is more of a smoothie that a regular lassi and there are tons of flavors to choose from. I'm a bit of a purist when it comes to lassi so i was scared to stray away too far from convention. \n\nI would definitely go back to try a few more of their combinations, hopefully run into \"The Hassan\" that everyone talks about\n\nPS. I generally never forget to take pictures of the food, this time the excitement got the better of me"

It was clean and bright, and empty of customers when the 4 of us arrived. Since I had never been, I asked a few questions and the gentleman behind the counter, a young dude with thick-brimmed glasses, was funny, helpful, patient and happy to assist, providing answers and recommending selections. After we placed our orders we noticed the place filling up with customers, some appeared to be regulars and some new like us, and he took great care of everyone while filling orders too. We each got different chat and lassis to go, and everything was so freakin good. Fresh, crunchy, salty, spicy, sweet, refreshing. You should go! Try the Crazy chat and chocolate peanut butter banana lassi - they'll even make it vegan."

While I am usually very patient in these kinds of situations, I was pretty frustrated that they chose to train someone on how to make a lassi on a Saturday evening.\n\nWhen we finally got our peach lassi it was very milky, icy, bland, and not at all peachy.  It was nothing like the tangy, thick yogurt-drink I imagined it to be.  Maybe I just don't like their style, but this lassi was nothing to write home about and we actually ended up giving it to our cats...\n\nI'll definitely be back to give them another try though... the chaats look great and I'm hoping this is not their norm."

When it was handed to me it was not what I'm used to seeing a Punjabi look like. It was colorful and flavorful! It was a mix between crunchy and soft, spicy and sweet. And I paired it off with a Mango Lassi which was also very good but I would say that they needed to add a little more mango and less yogurt. I will definitely be going back to try all their other dishes and lassi's."

Pick from selection of fresh fruit including pineapple, mango, blueberry, peach, etc. You can also include fresh mint (straight from a mini-garden on the sidewalk) for a tangy twist. Mix and match if you want! Note that these lassis are not the usual thick yogurty versions but are more ice-y. If you are lactose-intolerant, there are non-dairy versions too. \n\nThe cafe also serves a variety of chaat, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. If you have never tried chaat, I would highly recommend tasting the flavor explosion of potato pieces, fried wonton-like crisps, chickpeas, onions, etc covered tangy-spicy-sweet sauces, yogurt, and other spices. The owner will make you a chaat based on your \"mood\" and if it doesn't quite fit your fancy, he is willing to make you another one.\n\nThere is limited seating at Mood Cafe - only a counter of about 5 seats and additional outdoor seating. But most people order take-out (samosas to go!) so there is usually an open spot to grab."

Mood isn't the best food I've ever had, and I don't think it's trying to be. But damn is the owner good at doing the few things he does. \n\nAlso, when I went vegan, it was one of first things I knew I could have; both the chaats and lassis can be made vegan. The vegan pomegranate lassi is my new favorite, whereas the fig/rose combo lassi was my old non-vegan fave. I've never had an issue with the food, though I never have touched the meat and can't review that, and I've never had an issue with the lassis except for not liking all the flavors. That just comes down to personal preference, though, as I know others who love the flavors I am not a fan of, and vice versa.\n\n(By the way, do try to branch out further than the mango lassi! IMO many of the others are WAY better, and you can get mango lassi in so many other places.)\n\nMy friends and I try to limit ourselves, but I think on average I have Mood about once a week. (In my defense, it's across from the laundromat and it's my treat for doing laundry.) Hassan has impressed me and my friends as I bring more and more of them to try his food. The most recent time I was there, Hassan accidentally did not make a vegan chaat for me (though I always do ask), but after I asked if there was yoghurt on my chaat he realized his mistake and quickly and apologetically made me the new chaat AND gave me the old one with the yogurt on it to \"share with my friends,\" which I happily did. What nice customer service. :)"

I look forward to returning. The seating area is very, very small, but we were lucky enough to snag a table. The owner even let everyone in the restaurant try something just because a kid that was there asked what it was. He told us we didn't have to pay unless we loved everything, and he would change anything we wanted. This is how a restaurant should be run, and this kind of customer service is why this place consistently gets 5 stars.

I also remembered seeing that they served lassi and milkshakes, so off we went!\n\nMy friend comes from a sad, sad place where she can get Indian food but not chaat. I feel bad for her. So she was a little overwhelmed and watched carefully as the guy at the counter explained everything he was going to do to my papri chaat. That was no simple task, since this chaat was loaded up like you would not believe. I can't even begin to list all the things that went into it, just layer after layer of all good things. Maybe a little heavy-handed on the sauce so it got soupy toward the end, but every bite brought something new.\n\nIn fact, it was loaded up enough that we considered sharing. We were talked into getting a couple of samosas to go with, which was very kindly turned into samosa chaat just to make our tastebuds happier. And, seeing that my friend was unused to chaat, the owner told her not to pay until after she'd eaten. Very nice of him. She loved it, though!\n\nEven though were were stuffed from our chaat orgy, dessert was needed. Namely, something cold! My friend was intrigued by the sandlewood shaved ice (something I will be trying someday) but sadly the ice machine had not been delivered yet! We both ended up with saffron milkshakes, a great choice. The shakes are made thin, which means you can suck them down on a summer day without feeling like you'll explode. The saffron ice cream is heavy on the pistachio, but tasty and something you're not going to find everywhere.\n\nOverall, Mood Cafe was a great experience. It's obvious that the owner is really going out of his way to bring in business and distinguish this location from Desi's other spots. He's doing a great job, and I'm glad to help by raving about the food and service! Another trip or two that good and I'll bump them up to 5 stars for sure!"

I've been here countless times since it opened up in 2011, and tried a variety of the lassi flavor combinations. Combining chaat with salad is sheer genius and that credit goes to the owner Hasan who is also behind Desi Chaat House. Seriously, the idea should be patented by him, as it's the most unique way to make South Asian street food trendy, hip, healthy, and accessible to people. The chaat serves as the crunch, and the raitas and chutneys as dressing for the salad, with other delicious mix-ins. The lassi's are pretty great too. Mood Cafe uses fresh fruit that is frozen so that any flavor smoothie can be enjoyed in any season. My personal favorites are the guava lassi and the pomegranate lassi.

Never had I had so many flavors going through my mouth at once ... savory of the carbs, tangy of the fruit/mango, sweet of some Pakistani ethnic fruit, etc. etc. In short, it resulted in one very happy mouth at the end of the day.\nYou can't go wrong with the lassis either, though I would go for the mango one. Light on sugar and definitely light on the conscience vs. frozen yogurt or ice cream (in terms of calories).\nHowever, I think the one thing that really impressed me was the customer service ... he won't let me pay him unless I found the food satisfying. Not only that ... he also ended up giving us two desserts (rice pudding and carrot something) for free and refused to let us pay for them.

The chicken chaat and the mango lassi were delicious!  I never expected the chaat to be so full of flavor! It was sweet, savory, and a bit spicy. The mango lassi was not too sweet and really good with the chaat. Can't wait to go back and try some more, especially the lassi."

Unfortunately the indoor seating is subpar.\n\nAs far as the food, I've never been disappointed. With all the options, selections, and combinations, along with the fact that you get a little extra lasssie to share with your friends, you can't go wrong with mood cafe! I recommend a rose-honey lassie. There are little sweet chewy pieces at the bottom, and the rose flavor works amazing with yogurt! \n\nI would like to visit in the colder months, but I doubt I will be as inclined to go with the indoor seating. If they moved the freezer (space is tight), acquired comfortable/fancy chairs, and put on some fitting music, I might change my mind!"

It may look a bit small and old, but the menu is wonderful. They have about 100 types of lassi (not just mango lassi), ranging from fruit flavor, veggie to peanut butter. We got a mango - papaya lassi, a rose lassi and a chicken chatt. It's hard to say which one was best, because they all tasted wonderful. extremely aromatic and not too sweet (Yesss!) \n\nThe owner was really friendly and nice to us. We got overwhelmed by the menu, so we stood there 15mins just to study it. Lol and he just chatted to us the whole time and making great great suggestions! I haven't met such a friendly, sweet and nice owner in a very very long time. And you can tell he's sincerely nice to you. And other customers there were very sweet as well. \n\nI can't make enough recommdation about this place! Great food, good price and more than wonderful service.

I had no idea what was going on in my mouth and I didn't like it. I wanted to think this was a dessert, but then I'd get a chick pea. When four hungry guys all decline to finish a meal, you can be pretty sure there is a problem.\n\nThis place is not cheap or particularly good. Skip it. Go to Fu Wah around the corner and treat yourself to some Bahn mi. Come on Yelpers, five stars? Really?"

If you get a lassi, you'll often get a little cup that contains the rest of the lassi if it doesn't fit in the cup. The chaat is delicious, although I think a big part of this place is the experience and being able to interact with a restaurant owner in such a consistently positive way. \n\nWould recommend, definitely revisiting this place when I'm in the area, if only to grab a quick lassi."

Incredibly affable, really cares that you thoroughly enjoy your meal (he guarantees that you will, or you don't have to pay), and tends to throw in extra treats for free -- a lassi my first time, an ice cream sundae the second.

I had heard a lot of positive things about it before I actually got to go and it definitely lived up to my expectations. My friends and I went for their lassis and we each ordered a different flavor. I ordered the blueberry lassi and my friends got a rose lassi and a chocolate raspberry lassi. \n\nThe blueberry lassi was light and delicious. I asked for it with less sugar (I'm not too big of a fan of sweets) and the owner was happy to accommodate! I tried a sip of the rose lassi and it was delicious as well. It was sweet but had a touch of fennel to it. I didn't try the chocolate raspberry but my friend was extremely happy with it. \n\nOverall, I would highly recommend Mood Cafe for their lassis, which are very reasonably priced and are huge portions! The manager/owner was also extremely friendly and was willing to answer any of our questions and accommodate any modifications (like my request for less sugar). His attitude was so positive and even said that we'd get our lassis free if we didn't absolutely love them (we did!). I only wish that my lassi was a little creamier and more consistent but I still really enjoyed it. Also, if you are vegan, they can also make their lassis with almond milk instead of yogurt, which is the traditional base. I would definitely come back!"

Made with love and care, the intricate blend of ingredients is truly magical. Each flavor is bright, distinct, and amazing. I cannot recommend a specific lassi or chaat because if you choose from any of the literally hundreds of possible combinations, you will not be disappointed. Although Hassan always says kindly that you can have your money back anytime if you do not approve, no one has ever done so.\n\n2. From the wildly popular rose lassi to the many fruits in the chaats, every single food item on the menu is made fresh from scratch. It makes you wonder if he is actually hiding a huge secret elaborate garden somewhere?! \n\n3. Vegan, lactose-intolerant, and can't eat spicy? No worries fellow patrons.

My boyfriend and I went on a blistery cold December day, and we were his only customers that strolled thru the door. He explained what a chaat was very simply, and stated that if we liked it, we pay for it. If not, then he doesn't want our money. But with such nice service, how can I NOT pay him? Even if I wasn't the biggest fan, I can't just leave him without paying. So service - amazing, nice, comforting and welcoming\n\nFOOD - this is probably a personal preference. I thought it was just OK. It is extremely flavorful, almost too flavorful? Too much was going on in my mouth. It was also cold, which I wasn't expecting. But that's probably what a chaat is. So it's cold, spicy, cilantro-y, sour/lemony, curry/indian flavory, yogurty all at the same time. The flavors were great, but just not my cup of tea. \nLASSI - was delicious. Mint + honey, do something different, don't just do mango! He has everyyything under the sea. He picked the mint fresh too :)\n\nI probably won't return just due to personal preference.

I was here a few months ago sampling the heat at Chili Szechuan, and this time I was back to meet up with Yelp friends at Mood Caf\u00e9, the Chaat & Lassi emporium on the point at 46th Street.  Lucky for me, they were delayed arriving, and I had an opportunity for a long talk with Hasan, the owner/chef/creative genius behind the concept and the counter that is Mood.  I got the $.50 tour, and an autobiography worthy of Horatio Alger. \n\nWhile I had eaten Chaat (pronounced, \"Chart\") before, it had never been like this.  Hasan has taken what is basically a common street food in India and turned it into an adventure in eating.  It comes at you in several dimensions - taste, texture, hardness/softness, shape, spice, food group, color and surprise.  It sat before me the most colorful assortment of edibles imaginable.  I had the Salad Chaat with Chicken, but there was so much happening inside that take out container that the meat was forgotten in the exploration of what was going on with all the reds, yellows, stars, logs, crispies, noodles, dried fruit, nuts, fresh mango, greens, feta cheese, chili sauces, curry notes, etc.  It is difficult to describe all the hyperactivity in that bowl.  Imagine an Indian version of Trail Mix thrown into a salad rather than croutons. If he had tossed in some M & M's I would not have been shocked.  This baby was Buh-Buh-Buh-Bizzzeee!!!\n\nAnd, bottom line, it was awesome. We tried each others dishes, and all were unique and captivating. \n\nAnd, that does not even get into the Lassis.  More than 60 varieties of cool, creamy yogurty, sweetness.  Mine?  A Rose Lassi, complete with Rose Petals! Not just amazing, but fun!  If this wasn't enough, Hasan brought us samples of other Lassi combos in small cups to try.  This man knows how to seduce with great taste. Oh. And did I mention the Kheer and Rice Pudding he gave us at the end? \n\nOver the Top!\n\nAs good as Mood Caf\u00e9 is, it is a very small shop.  Four tables with bench seats along the wall and plastic stools for everyone else.  So, not the most comfortable arrangement.  It is geared as a take out place, with everything served in take out containers and plastic utensils.  I would be willing to pay more for comfort.  \n\nThe sheer enjoyment of the event (yes, this was more than just a cool meal) kicks the experience into 5 Star territory.  In truth, there should be another category available on Yelp that addresses the euphoria and exclamations needed for certain special foodie moments.  \n\nMood Caf\u00e9 would reach that level of extreme amazed unadulterated satisfaction. \n\nYeowee!!!"

It's so different, yet so good! Its crunchy, savory, tangy, and spicy! Talk about a party in your mouth. Its also cold, which I was not expecting, but it also made it very refreshing even with all the different flavors. \n\nMood's caf\u00e9 specialize in Lassi (yogurt based smoothie) and chaat. It's a great spot for lunch or snack! Definitely come from lassi if chaat is not your cup of tea. In fact, the lassi menu is bigger than chaat menu. All the lassi can be made vegan w/ almond milk, and there are lots of vegetarian options. \n\nVegan mango lassi $3.99 - It was very refreshing and not too sweet. I would definitely come back to explore their other 59 flavor combinations. \n\nSamosa Chaat $5.99 - The portion seems small, but its definitely filling. I wish there was more than 1 samosa though. \n\nDaal Mash Chaat $6.99 - A little bit more savory than Samosa. I wish there was more of a difference between the two. I felt the only difference was the sauce and samosa. \n\nChaat is a popular street food in India, and its awesome that Hassan brought it to West Philly."

We'd both had chaat before (elsewhere) and wanted to give Mood Cafe a try.\n\nIt was definitely worth it. Hassan was a supreme host - asking us our personal taste, if we liked this or that, how spicy we liked our food. The chaat he created was absolutely amazing; full of figs and raisins and radishes and samosas and mango. It was really a work of art and wonderful to watch him create it, talking to us about the food all the while.\n\nI highly recommend the lassi - whether you get a fruit flavored one or a traditional one, they're amazing. He actually created new blends for myself (fig and date) and my friend (mint and honey). It was a perfect place to have a late-afternoon lunch and food conversation. We will definitely be going back."

I told Hassan that I wanted a lassi and a chaat however he felt was best for a Pakistani food newbie who loves spicy food and lamb. He made me a delicious milk, almond, and date lassi and a chaat that contained spicy, flavorful lamb, yogurt, chick peas, special sauces, and chips that created for a uniquely delicious experience. And to top it off, he threw in a lightly sweet carrot hawla since he wanted me to have a great 1st Pakistani food experience. I think he exceeded his goals. If you're in Philly and in need of a pick-me-up, Mood Cafe will definitely deliver on that."

I came here during the miserable heatwave of the summer and saw the line of happy people at Mood Cafe!  I was hungry, but not hungry for a full on meal and walked in sweaty and thirsty.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, according to Wiki lassi is: ablend of yogurt, water, spices and sometimes, fruit. Traditional lassi (a.k.a., \"salted lassi\", or simply, \"lassi\") is a savoury drink, sometimes flavoured with ground and roasted cumin. Sweet lassi, however, contains sugar or fruits, instead of spices.\n\nWell, don't fret if you are picky because there is a mind-blowing combination of flavors here.  Literally a wall full of drink combos. Most the the people came for mango, but I went with watermelon. All I can say was it was cool and refreshing with a slight watermelon flavor and hint of spices.  If you are unsure with what you want and order something you can't stomach - they will gladly make you a new drink. You even a get a small cup of the extra.\n\nI got a lassi and samosa and it was under $5! Deal. The veggie samosa was one of the best I have had and totally kills the ones I have eaten in Torrance. I didn't try the chaat and did see people ordering dishes of it to go. Seems like a popular vegetarian spot as well.\n\nThis is a friendly neighborhood cafe with kind owners and staff. They really give you service with a smile and believe in the quality of their products. Good find in Philly!"

However, she insisted this was the new spot. \n\nWe arrived right as they opened, and there was already a line. The owner was on the phone trying to fix the computer/credit card machine. He took our orders anyways, and let us eat outside without paying up front - it was very sweet to see a restaurant owner trust their clientele. \n\nI got the Punjabi Chaat, it was very delicious. I like that he uses larger chunks/crisps compared to Desi Chaat. It's larger chunks of mango, larger pieces of dried samosa, and the portion was perfect. He even let us take the bottle of chutney to add as we ate, whereas other places charge you extra. AND even better it tasted like my mom's chutney and hit very close to home. Loved it.\n\nI also tapped into my sisters Tandoori Chaat which was PHENOMENAL, the chicken was moist and very flavorful. I almost wish I could've had that alone. \n\nWell done!"

We also got a mango lassi and a cardamom lassi, which are like very thin frozen yogurt-based smoothies. Both were excellent. It is deceptively a ton of food, but don't make the mistake of saving the chaat for leftovers like I did - the crunchies get soggy :(\nI've been back once for both the chaat and lassi, and I will definitely be back again for the lassi. There are probably about 50 flavors, and if they are at all close to as delicious as the mango and cardamom ones, I will have to try more!\nBonus: I saw this in a couple other yelp reviews and he did it both times we went - he makes more lassi than will fit in a cup, so he gives you the extra in a smaller ~6 oz. cup, so it's perfect for swapping with whoever you go with to try more flavors!"

I grew up eating Indian food, but for some reason, never heard of \"Chaat\". I had questions. There was a younger man behind the counter, who answered my questions SUPER FAST... On top of the accent, I really couldn't understand him. I wish he'd taken the time to speak slower, and explain. So I felt kinda rushed to make my decision on food.\n\nI got a Chicken Tikka chaat. I've had this kind of Chicken before, so I kinda stayed in my comfort zone. Chaat, is simply all over the place. There are a lot of colors, textures, and tastes involved. Sweet, salty, all kinds of stuff. It was not a distasteful dish, but for me personally, it was just too much going on at once.\n\nI also ordered a vegetable samosa. I am absolutely NOOOO stranger to vegetable samosas. I've been obsessed with eating them since I was little. I basically only like them from one place in NJ. I have tried others, to no avail. Something is always off. But this placed, NAILED IT! They were perfect. I now have 2 places I will eat samosas from.\n\nMy lassi. The real reason I stalked this place out. Again, growing up, and still to this day, i loveeee lassi's. I only had mango, and a plain version of Lassi's before. I knew I need to expand my palate, and man will this place help me. My guava lassi was to DIE for. Definitely a key reason in why I will be returning.\n\nOn the way out the door, the owner exchanged in small talk with us, and thanked us."

He gave me a brief history of chaat as well as reasons behind why it is so satisfying (texture, balance of flavors, each bite is different than the last.) He asked if I wanted vegetarian or not, spicy or mild, and then got to work. Honestly I was glad not to have to create something myself because there are so many options. Better to let the pro take over. \n\nAnyway, the end product was this tremendously satisfying mix of mangos, dried cranberries, figs, potatoes, mint sauce, chickpeas, a samosa, and several other ingredients I couldn't make out. It was all delicious! I also got a fig lassi and another couple got a mango lassi. He gave us some of their extra as well as our own extra.

Everything about my visit was just perfect.\n\nLet's start with just walking into the store. I was immediately greeted by the most pleasant owner of the restaurant. After observing that my friend and I were newcomers, he was so helpful with asking what kinds of flavors and ingredients we each liked so that he could customize the perfect first dish for the two of us. I gave up fried foods for lent, which I thought would be difficult for a chaat dish since the base of the dish is fried strips, but the owner told me that they served salads too, so the no-fried-foods restriction wouldn't be a problem at all. I love when restaurants are this accommodating to customer needs.\n\nI wound up ordering a salad chaat with a mango lassi, and my friend got some kind of beef salad chaat with a strawberry lassi. Since it was our first time at the restaurant, the owner told us that if we didn't like the food, had a better chaat at another location, or thought the food was just \"okay,\" our meal would be free. I've never met another man with better customer service. The chaat itself was just wonderful - a wonderful merriment of spiciness and sweetness, crunchiness and chewiness. I will say that chaat in general has very unique and bold flavor, and it's definitely worth a try if you've never had it before, though it may not be ideal for everyone's tastes. Personally, I love chaat, and this dish was probably one of the best, if not the best, that I've had. I could just tell that all of the ingredients (especially the delicious mangoes and dates!) were so fresh, which made my tummy so very happy.\n\nThe lassis were amazing as well. I was blinded by how many choices of lassi that there were on the board, but I wanted to stick with the classic mango. It was the perfect sweetness, not overpowering, and had just a hint of tartness from the yogurt. The strawberry lassi was wonderful as well - tasted like a healthier and fresher version of a milkshake. I can't wait to come back and try all of the other delicious combinations and flavors of lassi. Mood Cafe also has vegan options (with coconut milk, almond milk, or soy milk), which is great and a must-try in the future for me too. \n\nIf the food itself isn't great enough, the business owner is one of the greatest humans I've ever met. He is so helpful and genuinely nice, and I felt like throughout the course of my meal, I was able to befriend him and hear so many of his wonderful stories. I asked about many of the unique ingredients and flavors found on his menu, and he was so enthusiastic in explaining to me and even letting me try a lot of his ingredients, such as his sweetened rose petals that are found in the rose lassi. Also, after hearing that my friend had never tried any of the desserts in his fridge (rice pudding, carrot halwa, and gulab jamun) before, he gave us samples of each! It was such a nice gesture and so uncommon nowadays in restaurants. It was so refreshing to find a restaurant that I genuinely love going into now.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that I will be back at Mood Cafe, even though it is a trek from Penn's campus. Lassi in the summer just sounds absolutely wonderful, but what I'm looking forward to the most is being able to talk to that wonderful man again."

Something you do not find a whole lot of, so I appreciated that about this place. There's only enough seats (along the storefront window) for about 4 people + chairs and they bring out the outdoor patio tables and chairs in May (after winter) so it'd be nice to eat outdoors.

I am not sure which one precisely I ordered, as I told him that I wanted something spicy and with chicken. So I got a salad chaat with spicy chicken (though that is not specifically listed on their menu), based off his recommendation. It was truly wonderful. It consisted of salad greens, two types of chickpeas, spicy pieces of chicken, cranberries, mango chunks, radishes, yogurt sauce, mint chutney, and some fried dough strips that had a curry flavor. I have never had anything like this. Will definitely be back for more chaat!\n\nProbably the biggest downside is that there isn't really anything warm to eat or drink on the menu.

I declared that I absolutely had to go back.  And boy was i glad that I did.\n\nAs most others have said Hasan is perhaps one of the nicest business owners in The City of Brotherly Love.   The strawberry lassi is my new favorite, the samosas are incredible (especially when dressed up with the sauces) and the crazy chicken chaat is like a modern art project both to look at and to taste.\n\nIf you've never had it before let them know, you'll get a brief lesson in all things chaat."

        "text": "5.0/5 \n\nThe lassi's at Mood Cafe aren't just good; they're heavenly. What's more, there's more flavors than you could ever imagine. Upon entering the cafe, you're immediately greeted by a huge chalkboard with a listing of 60 lassi and \"lassi combination\" flavors. There are your standard options -- like mango -- but also many more incredibly unique and exciting flavors to try: rose, apple fig, date almond, spicy mint, \"salty queen\" (this one's a bit of an enigma), orange papaya, peaches & cream...\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. The owner, Hassan, actually initially made a menu of 140 items, until he realized that customers were suffering from decision paralysis. If you ask, he'll craft an off-menu lassi custom made for you. After learning that I like nuts, he made me one of his own personal favorites, \"almond pistachio with a dash of cardamom\". It -- and each of the ~8-10 flavors I've tried so far -- was DELICIOUS. I would go so far as to describe Hassan's lassi combinations as an experience, not just a drink. In the first sip, you're hit with the whirlwind of different flavors in your mouth. It's surprising, so you sip again. Perhaps the flavor gives you an immediate joy, or perhaps you're not sure what to think. Nonetheless, you're intrigued. So you sip again. Soon enough, with sip after sip, you begin unraveling the complex tastes of the drink, until it gains a familiarity that makes the flavor even more delicious with every sip.\n\nProtip: If you like the yogurt flavor of traditional lassi's, ask for a yogurt base. If you prefer something more like a juice smoothie, ask for a juice base.\n\nBesides the tastiness of the drinks, I'd also like to note that the owner Hassan is incredibly friendly. Every time I've gone with friends, he'll give us an extra sample cup with each of our drinks so that we can trade and try each other's flavors. He promises not to charge us if we don't like our drink, though we've never done that of course because every drink is delicious. The last time I went, he even gave my friend and I extra sample cups from a different customer's custom drink, so that we could try a new flavor he had never made before, \"rose mint\". (This one's particularly special because it's made from rose and mint that Hassan grew himself!) Mood Cafe's massive menu is something Hassan has incredible fun with, and you can see it in the delight on his face when he gets to combine different ingredients in new and interesting ways.\n\nWhile I usually go to Mood Cafe for the lassis, the chaat is also pretty tasty. Warning: If you ask for \"very spicy\", it's ACTUALLY very spicy, not your typical Americanized \"very spicy\". I consider myself to have a fairly okay spice tolerance, and I absolutely died. Thank goodness I had the lassi to save me from the fire ^^;; On the other hand, I didn't find the \"medium spicy\" to be spicy at all.\n\nIn summary, would highly highly recommend, especially the lassi combinations! And if you have the time, be sure to strike up a conversation with the owner too -- he's super friendly!"

This is some real, down-home cookin', IndiPak style. I wandered in alone after a random tip, and, man, was it amazing. \n\nThe fresh-squeezed juices are AMAZING (try something you've never had before -- watermelon juice is just incredible), the owner taught me a lot about Indian food and cooking in general, and everything was out of this world. Oh, and they're vegan friendly!\n\nMy recommendation: go in with $10, ask the owner for a chaat of his choice and a lassi with your favorite fruit (forget mango, way to common), and, if it's not busy, talk to the owner the whole time you're eating. I promise, you WON'T be disappointed."

I have never had Chaat before, and honestly I still dont know what it is besides the fact that it is street food. The owner was super friendly and sweet. For those that know what Chaat is, it can be customizable. Since I had no idea what to even put in it, the owner asked me a series of questions, then proceeded to make me something he thought i would like. It was delicious. There were so many different textures and flavors to explore with each bite. \n\nThe lassi here is THE BEST! They have an array of flavors. If you can, please eat there! Whenever customers order lassi there is always leftovers, so the owner will kindly pour some into cups and bring it over to dine in customers for them to try. While I was eating there, I seriously tried like 4-5 different kinds of lassi that other people ordered. I had to bring my own lassi home because I was so full!\n\nThe owner also has a policy of not paying unless you are satisfied. My friend wanted to pay after we ordered, but the owner said we should eat it first to make sure we like it, then pay. Seriously, the best customer service I've ever experienced. Too bad I discovered this place too late, I was only able to eat here 3 times before I had to go back to Boston. If I am ever back in Philly, I will definitely visit this place again!"

I have never had chaat or lassis before, but the owner descriptively told me what I would taste/experience and accommodated the fact it was my first time at the restaurant.  \n\nHands down, the best part about my experience at Mood Cafe was the owner.  He welcomed me and made me feel right at home.  He not only made delicious food, he made sure my first experience was a great one.  Most importantly, he wanted to make sure I had enjoyed the food I was eating. He recommended a basic chaat for my first time, but wanted to make sure it was to my satisfaction to if I wanted to more/less spicy he wanted to adjust it.  Accompanied with good conversation, it turned this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant into one of the best experiences I have ever had.  Mood Cafe is a must go if you are an adventurous eater and like good service."

Walking in, you got the sense that the proprietor couldn't wait to tell you about chaat: he is to this celebrated south Asian street food what Bubba from \"Forrest Gump\" is to shrimp. Before we knew it, we were dancing around his dizzying selection. \"But don't worry,\" he said. \"If you don't like, you won't pay.\"\n\nThat wasn't a problem. We got the chicken tikka chaat, the panir chaat and the samosa chaat. They were all incredible, with layer on layer of flavors and fresh ingredients that you won't sort out before you get full, which you will, because the portions are quite generous. \n\nTo my surprise, my favorite was the panir chaat. Rather than the usual (and somewhat boring) tofu-like blocks of curd, this chaat was suffused with a crumbly, golden cheese with a flavor similar to burrata. It wasn't awash in the stuff--just enough to get the flavor through without feeling heavy. It was perfect.\n\nWe came at an off hour, with no other customers in sight, and the proprietor seemed to be getting a kick out of blowing our minds. He kept giving us stuff on the house. I had not even mentioned the word \"Yelp,\" so this was really just kindness. We tried his carrot halva, which Heather loved--I thought it was too sweet--and his oh-so-decadent rice pudding.\n\nThe lassis we ordered each came with a side cup (as seen in some of the user photos), meaning that we could each have some of one another's lassi. I got the almond pistachio with a dash of cardamom, and Heather got papaya. Heather thought her papaya was a bit too yogurt-forward at the start, but found that it grew on her. I thought that mine was perfect, and had to cut myself off.\n\nThe entire order was $33, and we each got two and a half meals out of it. Even excluding the generous samples that we enjoyed, that's pretty damned good--especially for a place with such wonderful food and service."

I'm not exactly sure what all was in it, but I got the crazy chicken, which had two types of chicken, mango, potatoes, crunchy rice strips, and lots of sauces and spices.  It really is totally unique, and a beautiful presentation.  The portion is large too, could only eat half.  I also grabbed a samosa on its own, and it was really good.  It came with chick peas and some sauce.  For my lassi I went with banana and fig.  It was super tasty.  I took my order to go, but there is some seating inside.  I definitely recommend taking the trip to West Philly to give Mood Cafe a try."

There was no one inside, but the man sitting outside (who I later realized was the owner) nodded and smiled to us through the window. The person who came out to take the order was very helpful when we asked for help with the menu, which consisted of 6 different lassi flavors, and about 20 variations of chaat. All lassis can be made vegan, and there are plenty of vegetarian chaat choices. There is also the option of a salad chaat. The space inside is very small--there's a counter and a few seats, and a couple refrigerators of drinks and desserts.\n\nWe ended up ordering a mango lassi (they suggested starting with the classic before trying flavors such as cucumber mint), a samosa chaat, and a Punjabi chaat. While we were waiting for our food, the owner came in. He boasted that they had the best mango lassi (or it's free) and explained what a chaat was. (It is made of a lot of components. I remember potatoes, mangoes, radishes, chickpeas, crunchy fried dough strips, mint sauce...) He was so friendly and so passionate about the food. He also gave us a mango lassi sample after hearing that we'd only ordered one.\n\nWe sat outside to eat. The lassi (my first one) was delicious--cool and creamy with just the right amount of sweetness and a lot of mango flavor. It was also very helpful for managing the spice of the chaat, which we ordered at a medium spice level. The chaat was crunchy, flavorful, and filling. Some of the sauces and components are sweet (I was reminded of craisins), some savory, and some spicy. There were crunchy bites and soft bites. Everything tasted fresh and yummy!\n\nI look forward to returning soon!"

Good reviews, excellent photos and decent prices brought me in, and I couldn't have been happier with my choice. Thank you again, Yelp, for steering me to such a great find in the city of brotherly love.\n\nMood Caf\u00e9 had some seriously high reviews.. a solid 5 star rating with close to 250 reviews, so they've got to be doing something right. They serve a dish called Chaat here.. something I've never heard of and something that I figured I might as well try. \n\nThis place is much smaller than I expected. No real sitting area, but they have a couple of makeshift tables and plastic stools for people who want to eat there. Plastic forks, knives and napkins sit by the door as a \"grab your own\" kind of thing. You place your order at the counter and they prepare it in plastic to go containers.\n\nHaving no clue what I wanted, I told the guy behind the counter that I was in town for the night, saw they had some great reviews on Yelp, and I wanted to see what it was all about. He explained one of the menus was yogurt based smoothies and the other was the chaat. He also helped steer me by asking if I wanted vegetarian or the type of protein I wanted. \n\nI think I should point out that I had no clue what chaat was and really still don't. I know it has a lot of tasty sauces.. some crunchy bits and fresh mango in it. Mine had the Chicken Tikka in it too, because that's what I ordered. There were some items in my dish that were cold and some that were hot. Some bits were crunchy and some bits were not. While I cannot tell you exactly what it was (or if it was authentic like some reviews claim it is not) I can tell you it was delicious and I ate every bite of it.\n\nI also ordered the blueberry lassi and was really happy with it. A friend ordered the mango and we were each given a full glass of what we ordered and a smaller cup with the other one so we could taste it. I thought this was a really nice gesture and was very appreciative of it.\n\nI'd love to tell all of my friends about Mood Caf\u00e9 and haul them all to Philly to give it a try, but there wouldn't be enough room in the place for everyone.

Once we had that sorted out, we ordered: fig lassi, rose lassi, bhel puri, and a lamb dish. We tried to order one more chaat, but Hassan assured us that he would put the lamb on a salad, making it one of his salad chaats, and that we would have more than enough food. He was right. \n\nI love rose flavored drinks and desserts, the boo does not however, as he finds the flavor to be overpowering. Not so with the rose lassi - just the right amount of that subtle hint of flavor. The fig was fantastic, too - and Hassan's blender makes more than what fits into the plastic smoothie glasses, so you'll get an extra plastic cup filled with bonus lassi. \n\nThe bhel puri was unlike anything we've had before. Traditionally, it's a dish with puffed rice, sev (crunchy thin noodle-like), potatoes, chickpeas, coriander, and onions. You can top it off with either coriander based or tamarind based chutney. Hassan takes artistic license with his bhel puri chaat - in addition to all of the traditional components, there was some hot sauce, mango, fig, and yogurt. Looking at it, I was confused as to how all of those things would work together, but don't question the magic, it was absolutely delicious.  \n\nThe lamb salad chaat was a similarly confusing, but ultimately delicious experience. The lamb had the right texture to hold together in a salad, and had a nice cumin flavor to it. \n\nAs we were among the last customers, all of us in the restaurant got a free dessert. Folks, even if we had to pay for it, that rice pudding/khir was amazing - the rice was so tender, and the pudding perfectly sweet. \n\nCan't wait for our next adventure here!"

While the sauces had good flavor, the ingredients didn't seem to match.  I felt like I was eating thrown-together ingredients with no real connection to each other or the sauces.  My friend said the person preparing the chaats didn't particularly know what he was doing.  \n\nConsidering this place is on the other side of the city for me, I probably won't go back.  The flavors just weren't there."

The chaat is unlike anything I have ever tasted - a perfect combination of sweet, salty, crunchy, spicy...somehow it all fits together.  If you haven't tried it Hassan will make you one and let you try it before you pay.\n\nTonight I had a new favorite - one of the meals with rice, lentils, indian pickle, and yoghurt.  It was unique and delicious!!\n\nTo top it all off, Mood has INCREDIBLE lassis, vegan lassis, juices, and special desserts.  The lassis are amazing with fresh fruit in pretty much any combination you want.  Also, even though I'm not vegan, I love the vegan lassis.  They are made with soy milk, almond milk, fruit, and ice--more like a smoothie and lighter than the regular lassis.  Perfect if you are full from eating a chaat!\n\nAside from the food being incredibly fresh, unique, and always delicious, the service at Mood makes you feel like a special guest.  Tonight, I ordered a vegetarian lentil meal, and Hassan let me try another vegetarian option as well just because he thought I'd like it.  His hospitality made the whole experience extra special.\n\nCheck Mood out - you'll love it!"

Hassan (the owner) said that being addicted to his chaats is worse than being addicted to drugs since the only place you can get his chaats is on this street corner in West Philly. I have brought numerous people with me to eat here and not one person has not liked it--they all loved it.

This place really fills an interesting niche- I would go here for the ice cream alone, but of course they also serve FRESH squeezed juices, lassi's and chaat and assorted other treats. I loved the Indian style tutti-frutti and saffron ice creams (both of which I was given samples!). The American style chocolate, strawberry, almond butter(!), and more were all DELICIOUS. And I say this as an ice cream connoiseur. The fresh juices also make it a dangerous spot for me- watermelon, mango, carrot, nothing's better in the heat. They're open in the evening's when you want to go for a stroll and have a destination, and there's always going to be something new and exciting to try- something for every mood. Plus, you can hang around at the two outdoor tables or indoor window seating and watch the neighborhood while you have a chaat. Enjoy!"

Nowadays I live right next to Mood Cafe and it has become a local favorite of mine (for good reason). The owner, Hassan, is a good man who aims to please and has never once lets me down. I often stop by after class not bothering to look at the menu and always asking about any new creations or concoctions as I love to explore and try new tastes and flavors. \n\nFair warning, there is no kitchen on premises so don't expect the meals to be made in front of you from scratch and magically served within minutes. I love and recommend the samosas (with all the fixings on them) and I always ask for a nice kick of a spice. Hassan often tells new clients of his money back guarantee if your not pleased but I have yet to see anyone take him up on it. What I really love about Mood Cafe and why I happily give it 5 stars is because of the menu; it isn't stale or rigid, rather more of work of art, dynamic and ever-evolving. The other reason is because it's one of the few places that takes me serious when I say I want \"back home\" spicy spicy, NOT white man spicy ;-). hehehe"

Multiple varieties of namkeen, papdi, fruits and even dry fruits like cranberries! No two bites of the plate are alike in flavor or texture and yet it all comes together very well. Trippy stuff!\n\nThe lassi varieties are exhaustively long and if you have a problem picking one, he will suggest you one based on your preference of flavors. If you're vegan or lactose intolerant, he has you covered too. I thought that Lassi was forever off the list for me, but he had a unique and yummy take on the drink using coconut cream.\n\nJust when all of us thought we were stuffed to the brim and could not eat another spoonful, he offered us desserts on the house. His nature reminds me of an aunt who really likes to pamper everyone with her generosity and good nature. Quite an experience overall. Worth the 5 stars."

Mood's menu isn't extensive, (lassi, chaat, dahl, and desserts from the Indian subcontinent), but there are lots of varieties of each item, and the food's flavor is EXPLOSIVE! \n\nThe owner immediately walked us through the menu and made some suggestions based on the kinds of flavors we said we liked. He then customized two chaat dishes and two lassis for us. Fresh mango, spicy peanuts, sweet cranberries, radish, chickpeas, yogurt, mint, chutneys, and a rich samosa were in my chaat. My friend got the chicken version, which was like my vegetarian dish, but with juicy chunks of tandoori chicken. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our order, two other folks came in--one who ordered a mint/honey lassi. The owner said, \"Wait a minute. I have to go get some mint.\" He walked out the store, went to a small garden on the sidewalk, cut some fresh mint leaves, and returned to make her lassi.

I was astounded by the variety.\n\nThe owner began chatting us up when we were deciding what to order, and filled us in about the origins of chaat and the lassi. He also claimed - and without dissent - that he makes the best lassi (not just in Philly, not just in PA or the whole US) IN THE WORLD. He said if you did not agree, you could keep your drink for free. But no one has taken him up on that yet.\n\nWe both got the house special - the mango lassi. Mine was vegan, and I was shocked that....yes, these were the best mango lassis I'd ever had. Even the one that traded yogurt for almond milk. It must be in the smooth mango that blended in. While making our choices, the second man behind the counter gave us tastes of both the banana date and rose lassis. They were both incredible. The rose lassi tasted like my past. AND IT HAS REAL ROSE PETALS.\n\nHands down, you've got to come here and try a lassi...or 12. I expect to come back for the chaat and update my review to an even more glowing 5 stars."

The chaat portions are generous and you really can't go wrong - the first time I went in, I just asked for Hasan's recommendation, and I've tried a bunch of different ones since then. A lot of them taste quite similar, with slightly different flavor profiles. My regular order is the Punjabi chaat and some kind of berry combo lassi, comes to about $11 plus tip.\n\nTips: I order my chaat \"medium spicy\" and would not consider it to be spicy, just tangy and yummy. If you want spicy I would ask him for more than that. I usually can't finish a single order of chaat in one sitting unless I am very hungry. However, one order is not enough to split between two people for a meal. I usually eat it for an early dinner and then come back to it a bit later to finish before it gets soggy.\n\nThis is not luxury dining, this is fast casual cold comfort food drenched in sauce, and it's awesome. Lassis are also delicious, although I haven't been adventurous and typically order fruity and safe. Five stars for what it is, an excellent affordable option run by a West Philly treasure."

And saucy? I don't know.....\" and I didn't think I would be back. But then, about a week later, I got this wicked craving out of nowhere for - you guessed it - chaat. And so I went back.

However, the first bite brushed away all thoughts. It was delicious and crunchy and perfection in every bite!

        "text": "The Greeks were wise: one should be on guard against argumentum ad hominem.\n\nI would think there's a fair proportion of yelp reviews that disparage an establishment based on what they perceive to be a disproportionate ratio of patrons that have disregard for basic hygiene and attire that doesn't wage all-out war on the people's sensibilities. I refer to the \"H\" people - not homeless, but hipsters. But, just because the hip.... people find merit in a restaurant, shouldn't be held against a restaurant. Admittedly, I have long been challenged in this belief by the places I've given the benefit of the doubt of a trial - but, Mood Caf\u00e9 is one of the rare instances where I concur with the H people.\n\nPhilly seems to have its share of establishments where the owner's personal interaction is both engaging as well as entertaining to watch. The proprietor of Mood Cafe, Hasan Bukhari, takes less than a minute to size up the customer and make the appropriate recommendation - and then a few more to win your heart.\n\nIt's a thoughtful business model. Mood Caf\u00e9 provides dozen of variations on Chaat (traditional savory snack in South Asia often served roadside or by food carts) that go beyond the basic Samosa Chaat, Papri Chaat, and Paani Puri to non-traditional combinations that feature salads and meats. Same is the case with Lassi (yogurt based drink, more popular in summer months in the subcontinent) where you can order beyond the typical salted, sweet, or mango Lassi and select non-traditional flavors like Raspberry, Plum, and Mint. Hasan is thus able to offer considerable variety to customers at affordable price points, and helps them navigate through the extensive menu - then he tops that up by assuring them that if they don't like it, they don't need to pay for it. It's not simply the implied money-back guarantee, Hasan ensures that clients aren't hassled and leave happy even if that entails offering small sized cups of Lassi to crying toddlers who want to drink what their mothers are!\n\nI tried the Samosa Chaat and liked it (4 stars) because it was liberally sprinkled with Chaat Powder as is tradition and was suitably spicy. But, I thought the fusion of flavors was more to the tune of what I see in Indian restaurants as opposed to Pakistani ones (that typically emphasize one flavor in a dish). What won me over (beyond the fact of finally dining at a clean, hygienic Pakistani eaterie!) was that Hasan doesn't simply boast idly on his product - he delivers results. When I asked for advice on which dessert to try: Carrot Halwa or Ras Malaai, he immediately guided me to the Kheer (rice pudding). When I asked: why? He responded that you wouldn't have eaten anything like it before. That was a strong assertion, one that I dismissed internally having tried tens of thousands of versions in life, given my sweet tooth. He laughed and said most versions people have tried (especially at Indian buffets that I am all too familiar with) are simply rice boiled with milk. I couldn't resist the challenge, and while I didn't give him the satisfaction of seeing me eat the rice pudding on the spot - must confess that I was blown away completely when I tasted it. Quite possibly the best version of (sub-continental) rice pudding I've e.v.e.r had.... Solid 5 stars.\n\nSo, go to Mood Caf\u00e9, and say hello to Hasan. Do try the Chaat and Lassi - but save appetite for some of the best rice pudding you'll ever eat."

It really seems like they aren't interested in customer service even if there are no other customers. \n\nThe chaat is alright, but there's not as much meat as I would've liked and a lot of filler stuff like potatoes.

I explained to him I thought I had ordered a lassi and a chaat as opposed to two different chaats.  He asked me if I wanted a lassi, but I wasn't about to spend more money on the meal.  There was a line of people waiting for food, so I was just being sport about and bought the two chaats and figured I'd eat the second one later.  \n\nI just thought from a customer service perspective the owner would have acknowledged that it was his mistake for not clarifying my order.  I also think he shouldn't have charged me for the chaat I told him I didn't know I had ordered.  Granted, it was my fault for not being more aware of the entire menu, but with the uniqueness of the menu format (on the wall, Chalk, with different menu items next to the same numbers).\n\nIt had rained outside when we were there, the owners helper was moving a floormat next to the door - he threw the mat on the floor right next to me while I was eating and dirty water splattered all over me.

But with the larger spot that Mood Cafe offers, Hassan and his crew have really managed to kick things up a notch and do some of the traditional and innovative recipes that their previous area couldn't maintain.\n\nMood does have a lot of the same menu offerings as Desi. But the larger food prep space does allow them to engage the customer with a lot more presentation when they put together the many ingredients that goes into their chaat recipes. This can make for a good interactive show of sorts that caters to your customization; especially when you factor in the number of spices, nuts, fruits, and other ingredients that you can add. Add in some chaat recipes variations that take on influences from other cultures, and things really start to get interesting.\n\nAnother plus to Mood is that its menu puts much more emphasis into the lassi, ice cream, and hot beverage side of the menu, making it a great spot to go to please your sweet tooth and grab a beverage on the go. Namaste!"

The owner, Hassan, is one of the kindest, most genuine people I ever met; he takes pride in the unique, high-quality food he delivers, and is eager to personalize the experience to each customer with a consultative approach. I felt warmly welcomed, and the food was freshly made on the spot. I happily got lost in the delicious flavors and textures of my chaat. I feel very positive about my experience; Mood Cafe exceeded every expectation and I will definitely return!"

Hassan, the owner/chef is probably the most gracious, and wanting to please host I have ever met.  He has a great disposition and said, from the beginning, if this isn't the best Lassi you have ever had, don't pay for it and he'll make you another.  If the Chatt isn't fantastic and you don't love it, don't pay for it either.\n\nWell, needless to say I paid for both!  He has many different varieties, combination of Lassi's as well as different combos of Chatt.  He gave me a wonderful education on Chatt and said that he would make me a vegetarian chatt.  I have eaten at many Indian restaurants, but have never had Chatt.\n\nThe meal was delicious!  It was so good, that I got a second order to take home to my wife.\n\nBy all means, even if you go out of your way, to go the Mood Caf\u00e9!!!"

Made tons of suggestions, was patient while I decided (first time getting a lassi) what I wanted and even whipped up a few samples for me! Seriously a great guy and AWESOME lassis! If you stop in try the mango or rose+cardamom!"

The food is delicious, the customer service is above and beyond and the prices are more than reasonable. \n\nThe best part about the place is the warm and welcoming owner. He may be one of the nicest people on the planet. On top of that, he can personalize any dish for you to fit your taste and/ or dietary needs--that includes you, Vegan/ Gluten Free individuals! He had a sign in the window about vegan options a while back but really he should put a sandwich board outside or something because people would come flocking.\n\nI encourage everyone who's had the pleasure of patronizing Mood to write a Yelp review. Doing so will bring attention to this fantastic local business"

But will say the walk is definitely worth it!\n\nService: the owner is always so sweet. Grows his own roses and gives you extra lassi in a smaller cup with the leftovers. Size of lassi is pretty large for one person. \n\nFood: the chaat was cold (not sure if it's supposed to be) but it was my first time having chaat and I wasn't that big of a fan. Mango lassi was 10/10. Rose lassi was done with a combination of a recommended spices from the owner. It had an aftertaste I wasn't too fond of but still good overall. A clean taste."

My boyfriend and I walk into this cafe and tell him it's our first time there and we don't know what a lassi or chaat is. He goes on to kindly but in detail describe to us what two are, telling us what's most popular, and what he would recommend us try as first timers. But that's not all! He tells us if we try his food and drink and we don't like it or think it's just okay, it's on the house! Wuuuuttttt?! You can tell this man seriously cares about making his customers happy.\n\nWe got the mango lassi and the vegetable samosa chaat...and then he says he'll throw in a second mango lassi for free because he wants us both to have our own to enjoy and then later he proceeds to give us samples of mixed berry lassi, samples of the rose infusion he puts into the rose lassi, and samples of cardamom seeds to try because he really wants us to enjoy and come back. It was great! You know he does it because he cares and is so into his business because he's sure not lacking business!\n\nYou could just taste how fresh the ingredients were! \n\nGreat food, great drinks, great service...you will see me back!"

First time I came with a foodie friend who had Mood cafe on her list for awhile.\n- Next visit? Maybe once more before I leave Phily but it's kinda far. Distance is the only factor though.\n\nFOODRINK:\n- Mangk Lassi: my friend had been craving the Lassi for so long and we were so focused on getting this Lassi that we left our cards at the previous restaurant we were at. It's made right on the spot. I wish there had been more yogurt. The options for lassis are endless. \n- Crazy Chaat: its house specialty! The sauce is aaaaawwweesssoomee. It's the perfect amount of cool, chilly, and spice. The potatoes are diced tomatoes perfect bite sizes. Lovr the crunch mixed with the creamy sauce and the refreshing zeal of the chutney. I wished we weren't so full from dinner but we still finished 80% of it.\n\nVIBE:\n- Very casual \n- Pretty small \n- Unexpectedly cute \n- The type of authentic place that doesn't focus on decoration. \n- Sits maybe maximum 8 people. \n- Service was great. Guy smiled a lot and gave funny suggestions. \n- Wait time for food arrival: almost non-existent"

It was definitely more Americanized (which I'll accept) but even the different chaat we had ordered ended up as pretty much the same mix of stuff with one/two variations. I wish they had proper samosa-chana chaat and pav bhaaji.\n\nLassis are a good fare - but not worth venturing all he way there for it. Have one when you are in the area, that;s all.\n\nI hate that this place has such rave reviews. It is not worth it, I'm sure. The owner, to me, comes off as a little over friendly, and I had hoped the chaat would be as good as he said - but I won't go back for it. I'd much rather not spend on what seems an awful imitation of real chaat."

While the lassis are enough to keep me coming back, the owner is one of the nicest shopkeepers I've ever met in my life. He's so helpful in explaining what exactly is in your chaat, what kind of lassi is good if you've never had one before, and always tells you to try your drink/food first before paying to make sure you like it. Both times I've been here, he's also given free samples of some of the other lassi flavors that my friend ordered!\n\nI've tried the peach and coconut lassis and they were both delicious. I liked the peach more though. I've also had the bhel puri chaat, which is a great mix of flavors and textures - crunchy papri and sev, tangy chutney, sweet mango, potatoes, and other things whose names I'm not entirely sure of.\n\nI definitely recommend Mood Cafe if you're looking for a quick and delicious meal, or a refreshing lassi!"

All I know was that it was tasty.\n\nI ordered the beef kofta chaat and a mango lassi. The ground beef topping was very flavorful, and the little spicy. I preferred over my friend's tikka masala chaat; the chicken was slightly dry. The rest of the chaat...was kinda of like an Indian version of nachos, only more chaotic. There were crunchy chip like things. but then there were layers and layers of other things. Like mango, apple, raisins (?), something sweet, something savory, and I kinda had no idea what the rest was. It shouldn't have worked, but it did, and it was tasty, and it was a fun experience.\n\nI kinda regretted ordering the mango lassi. Not because of the taste, because I appreciated a good mango drink in the middle winter. But because I was completely stuffed from the chaat itself. The drink was enormous: for some reason I got a full cup of lassi, as well as a smaller cup for my friend. \n\nWIll definitely come back to try the other flavors."

If the food alone isn't enough to put you in a good mood, he definitely will.\n\nI've tried several varieties of chaat and while it's true that the differences between each variety are pretty small, no matter which kind you get you'll have a different experience in every bite. Sometimes you get a bit of fresh fruit, sometimes you get the creaminess of the yogurt, sometimes the punch of hot sauce...and all with those delicious little crunchy bits. Chaat is like the perfect food for people with short attention spans (like me). The lassis are also delicious; fig is my favorite. \n\nIf I lived or worked closer, I'd be there all the time!"

We also tried a few flavors of lassi; mango, strawberry, mango papaya, and rose. All of them were so delicious! Their rose lassi is definitely a star and must have! Above all, the owner Hassan provided great company. Him and my dad even have the same name! Overall, amazing experience!"
