The space is long and narrow but ample seating and bright and airy. The overall aesthetic is very pleasing. The pastry case by the late afternoon wasn't super filled but there were enough options to choose from like the lemon tarte which was delicious! The coffee menu itself is rather small. I ordered a mocha which was definitely a more bitter chocolate which I didn't mind, but if you're used to sweet like Starbucks this may be a pass for you. The people working here were nice. The prices were a tad expensive for coffee and pastries especially when the coffee isn't super elaborate. I also wish they would use real cups. They might have these but they didn't bother to ask if my order was to go or not. They offer bread for purchase as well. The staff was nice, the bathrooms clean. Overall a pretty great cafe in Philly perfect for an afternoon pick me up."

I went two days in a row for a slice of their delicious orange olive oil cake and a pot of English Breakfast tea. I loved the brand of tea so much ( Kusmi from Paris) that I bought a box when I saw it in a nearby shop. The atmosphere is relaxing and a delightful respite from a busy day. Oh, and the employees are helpful and so nice. Most highly recommended."

We got there quite early in the morning, there were few people who were getting things to go, instead of dining in, which gave us all the seating options. They had some tables right at the entrance, and then more seating in the back.\n\nThe cafe is located on the corner lot, so it had lots of windows on the front and the side, bringing in bright natural light.\n\nRight at the entrance, they had some bread and baked goods, such as croissant, apple turnover, and raisin roll. On the side, they had lots of sweets such as macarons, tartlet, and \u00e9clairs. They also had some quiche as well. Since we were there super early, the pasty chef was still working on some items.\n\nWe started off with a couple of pastries and cups of coffee. I got a small Latte, and it was really small... They ground coffee beans at the time of order, which is great. The coffee was quite good, I wish if the mug was a bit bigger, even though I did order small. My hubby ordered a Cappuccino, they didn't have any choice of size, it came in a mug that is similar to the latte mug, but a bit shorter and wider. They were tasty coffees, again, just really small...\n\nWe had Sugared Chouquette, Napoleon, French Jam Cr\u00eape and Paris Philadelphia. They were all very tasty, high quality and oh-so-satisfying. It was a fun and tasty visit. The service was ok, not overly friendly but efficient. Their sweets were elegant and sophisticated, we enjoyed them all."

When I saw my FB showing a photo of Napoleon from J'aime, I can't wait to give it a try. \n\nWe went J'aime on Christmas Eve but they ran out of Napoleon so we ordered Chouquette which is very surprising good. The cream of Chouquette is very light without heavy sweet and last time I had such silky smooth cream with good/right puff is from beard papa(Japanese bakery).  \n\nSo, I decided to come back today in order to get in line for Napoleon. Like Chouquette, Napoleon also has a very velvet moisture cream and because J'aime doesn't glazed sugar or fondant on the top layer, it won't too sweet which I can even eat a whole without coffee or tea. We also ordered Quich\u00e9 and I like pie crust of Quich\u00e9 at J'aime is thinner than Le Pain Quotidien."

My tea was both delicious and refreshing. The apple tart was a French work of art....tender juicy apples encapsulated in a light pastry, not too sweet, not too tart...perfect! I enjoyed relaxing at my table open to the outdoor elements and watching people walk on by. The bakery has huge windows which were open at this time of year and made one feel as though they were outside, but slightly protected from the sun. The decor of white and grey tones created a sophisticated backdrop where  the pastries and other delectable goodies take center stage. The staff behind the counter were authentic French, warm and friendly. They even provided me with a sample of tea to help me choose among the options. \n\nYes, it's a bit pricey. However, the food, charm and patisserie ambiance made me anxious for a return visit. Be sure to navigate your way to J'aime French Bakery in the near future. I highly recommend it. Bon appetit!"

I called in to check if I could come by to take some photos of the interior and food to write about in my blog. Bastien O, the head chef/baker from France, picked up my phone call and gave me great advice on ideas of when's best to come and invited me over. He met me personally and told me of his whole routine from coming in as early as 4:30AM to start baking. Not sure how he makes everything seem so effortless, but his story is really impressive and work is magical.\n\nFor my brunch, I ordered the mushroom/spinach quiche that was accompanied with a side salad. As a sucker for citrus sweets, I ordered the orange tart in the display: the tantalizing orange tart was brushed with a syrup and crusted with sugar crystals. And because I was so sleep deprived, one nonfat latte. Bastien, one of the humblest chefs I've ever met, even came out to speak with me about his background and passion in baking and customer service.\n\nLoved the interior (the back also serves as a great spot for some to work) the attentive staff, cleanliness, quirky restroom with facts about toilets along the wall. Although I've left, part of my heart is still longing for that orange tart."

I honestly haven't tried anything else yet, but I know in my heart their other baked goods are just as delicious. This is my go-to place for french pastries."

The ambiance is pleasant and we were able to snatch a pair of seats in a comfortable booth. I love the modern/minimalist chic look, though I was slightly disappointed that the selection of pastries was a bit minimalistic at the time I came in as well. (Sunday afternoon) I'll have to stop by earlier in the day next time! \n\nNevertheless, I got to try a selection of pastries and definitely think that whoever makes these pastries knows what they're doing. They completely nailed it in the taste and texture department. \n\nFirst, the Paris-Philadelphia - their take on the traditional Paris Brest. Instead of a ring of choux pastry, it is presented in an oblong shape filled with Nutella cream. I was a bit surprised to find that the cream was a bit more on the \"buttercreamy\" side, but the texture and flavors still worked. The toasted almond slivers on top added a nice touch!\n\nThe napoleon (what I grew up knowing as a mille-feuille) was right on in terms of texture and flavor. The puff pastry had the right level of crisp and flakiness, while the pastry cream was perfect. However, the version I bought was a bit too minimalist, especially when factoring in the price. It only consisted of 2 puff pastry layers instead of 3, and only had 1 layer of cream. It also did not come with any toppings. I also noticed that my piece was smaller compared to ones other reviewers posted in their photos on this site, and I don't think I paid a lower price for it. \n\nI also got to try the blueberry galette, which was like a mini blueberry pie. It may have looked simple, but had a nice touch of citrus flavoring in its filling! They were kind enough to warm it up for 30 seconds for us. \n\nThe staff was friendly and pleasant. Not convinced that they are knowledgeable of the products sold, but they definitely showed effort! My favorite thing about this place is that they serve Kusmi Tea, and I love the small piece of meringue they had included with my tea!"

The ambience of the place really gets me - white everything, plenty of natural lighting, a lot of seating, and then the smells of a bakery permeating every corner. It brings you certain places.\n\nAs I cannot drink any caffeine, I opted to get a pastry. Did my research beforehand and got the orange olive oil cake and man did that live up to expectations. I wasn't really sure of what to expect because orange and olive oil are not flavors I'd put in a cake but they go so well together! It was maybe a touch too sweet for me but I also prefer things on the less sweet side. Texture was crunchy and soft at the same time (I know some people hate the word but it was hecka moist too) - there's little surprises in each bite when you crunch down. The slice was also huge so I felt like it was money well spent.\n\nI spent my time here reading (quiet enough that you won't get too distracted) and then catching up with a friend (so loud enough that you won't feel bad holding a conversation). \n\nOverall, great cute little shop. Visit if you can!"

It was smooth, hit the spot, and powered me through an work session. The croissants were promised to be a bit of France here in Philadelphia. They were fantastic, crispy, subtle, with the perfect amount of chocolate. I think the key aspect for me was the customer service. They were incredible and gave me a Jefferson discount, even when I didn't have any ID on me, but came straight from work. By the way, Jefferson affiliates gets a discount!

I've been desperately craving French pastries since I visited Paris and this cafe really does the trick!

I recently picked up a slice of orange olive oil cake and am obsessed - I can't wait until they have it there again!

The beverage choices were unique despite being your average coffee and tea options. \n\nI had the Paris Philadelphia which was a delicious crunchy pastry with a sort of hazelnut cream filling. The almond croissant was exquisite. There was a creamy and fragrant interior that made the croissant have a special taste I could not compare to any typical almond croissant I've had before. Overall, all the pastries, breads and baked goods were clearly made fresh and of quality touch. \n\nTheir tea choices are interesting. The basics like earl grey and hibiscus have hints of other flavors too, like lemon or mint! There's a little sign on the counter that describes all the flavors. Although they don't have iced tea as an option, I got a hot tea with ice on the side. The employees even gave instruction on the optimal time to seep the tea bags! It's these little details that made my visit to J'aime enjoyable. \n\nThe seating space was rather narrow in the back, but there was a range of window seating (square tables), small booth seatings (seats 2 people), and little tables in the back that had a long booth stretch back with chairs paired up with the booth seating. \n\nI loved the minimalistic touches. White marble tables, modernistic lighting, black/white wall art and simple little French-inspired paintings. Green plants livened up the space too! \n\nOverall, my entire experience at J'aime was a perfect coffee date. My only recommendation is that they play more music that fits the theme."

It is bright and cheerful, with neutral tones of marble, off white paint and grey accents. The tables are nice, they have a mix of seating, including white painted metal industrial Tolix style chairs, a couple booth style seats and a longer bench running along one wall. The cafe is meticulously clean and the display cases and counter are well lit. They have modern payments methods available, including Apple Pay. The view of center city street life from the cafe is lively with many locals walking to and fro, making the front seats pleasant in this regard.  The pastries are beautiful and delicious. I had a raisin roll, which was custardy and addictive. There were apple turnovers in the display case that looked like pieces of art, as did all the other pastries. Also had a cappuccino, which was nice. All in all, for opening day, I think they hit a home run. It's so difficult starting a new cafe and it is inevitable that there will be kinks to work out, but these weren't apparent. These guys thought of nearly everything, and the staff was very friendly. I was impressed by how seamless the operation seemed, regardless of it being day one - so hats off to what must have been incredibly meticulous planning, training and organization. All said, nice new addition to the neighborhood; I wish them well and will be interested to see how things evolve there as the business matures and as locals begin to discover the new cafe. I know I'll stop by when I'm in the mood for a delicious pastry."

One of my pet peeves about many coffee shops is that their nut milks tend to be sweetened (even if ever so slightly). So of course, I inquired and the barista reassured me that it was absolutely unsweetened since it was also something she was particular about too.\n\nWhile I didn't get a chance to try any of the pastries, there was a woman who had come in to purchase a slice of cake. She had raved about how she had the cake before and came back immediately to buy some more because of how delicious it was.

It's not enormous, and their stock isn't either--they'll typically have around 6 or 8 items (weighted toward choux pastries & buttery tarts), plus some breakfast items (e.g., croissants).

As a bonus, they serve La Colombe coffee, so you know it's going to be good! A bit on the pricey side, but not any more so than other small coffee shops. Their array of French pastries is excellent - they have both sweet and savory foods to satisfy either craving. The most unique thing about J'aime (in my opinion) is the little colorful meringues that you can purchase by the handful. Each color is a different flavor and they aren't overly sweet, making them a cute and fun snack! J'aime is the perfect place to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee, or to study/read.

They have croissants, napoleons, fresh baguettes baked daily ($3!), decent coffee/lattes (kind of small), crepes (with different jams including lemon!! yum!!) and all sorts of other yummy baked goods. Enjoyed doing a day's worth of studying here and was sufficiently satisfied with my snacks and caffeine fix. Also observed a decent amount of French speakers that came in and out, so seems legit in terms of their \"French\" character. \n\nUnfortunately, there isn't wifi, but there is xfinity wifi accessible if you have that!\nEDIT: Owner informed me there is wifi and to ask for it at the counter!

So naturally, I've been wanting to try it and today provided the perfect opportunity as I was in the city for the morning. \n\nLovely spot. Clean and fun and fresh and, fortunately, not too crowded later morning. My daughter and I enjoyed their Quiche Lorraine, as well as a Napoleon, and an almond croissant. The quiche was delicious, light and tasty, with a shortbread-like crust. The Napoleon...how can I describe it? It LOOKS like a heart-shaped shortbread cookie filled with buttercream. But when you bite into this pastry, it shatters and melts into a richly layered deliciousness. \n\nFriendly staff. What more could you ask for?"

It's small and cute...I wanted to sit and enjoy my coffee and croissant there but they were super busy and all the seats were taken :( Maybe next time...\n\nSo as soon as you walk in, there are various pastries on display and all of them looked AMAZING. Since I wasn't going to be able to sit and enjoy my visit, I decided on a large coffee and croissant to go. The baristas/servers behind the counter were nice and friendly and I was able to peek in the kitchen to see the chef baking all their goodies. So fascinating and cool. \n\nI am a fan of dark roasts...prefer them over light, and I wasn't disappointed. On their window is a sticker that says they serve La Colombe coffee and I saw their draft lattes but not sure if the regular coffee is. Maybe it was just a different blend than I normally drink at home? By the time I got to 15th Street to catch my ride back home, I was done with my coffee haha (coffee feind). I waited to get home to enjoy my croissant and O.M.G! It is by far THE BEST croissant I've ever had! Too bad they're not close to where I live...or maybe that's a good thing. I'd probably be there too often. \n\nI will DEFINITELY go back the next time I'm around, and now I know to buy more of their baked goodies to enjoy at home... I'm looking at you baguettes :P"

They are fresh and delicious. The quiche is excellent but very small, it comes with a side of spinach and a nice dressing. I would have preferred a lower price point than $12. The crapes are delicious and well price.\n\nThe employees are very friendly and welcoming and efficient. They always greet the customers with a smile and warm greeting. They deserve 5 stars. Thank you for your hard work.\n\nBut the reason for 4 rather than 5 stars, besides the expensive quiche, is that the bathroom didn't have a toilet paper holder. The toilet paper was placed on the toilet's tank and made it difficult to use."

        "text": "Overall Value:  The prices here are steep, and I was initially reluctant to get anything other than coffee because of it.  But the baked goods are amazing (made from scratch!) and totally worth it - the best I have had outside of Paris.  Nothing else in Philly comes close to the quality.  We still haven't tried the crepes or quiche (ugh, I just can't justify the $9 on such a small-looking quiche.  Maybe my mind will be changed once I finally try it), but the pastries are fantastic.  Definitely one of my favorite spots in Philly, and we return to it regularly. \n\nThe Food: We have had almost all of the pastries, including the croissants ($3), chocolate croissants ($3.25), napoleon ($5.50), eclair ($5.50), chocolate tartlet ($6), and paris philadelphia ($6).  They are all excellent - absolutely perfect, delicate textures with incredible flavor.  In my mind, the test for any french bakery is the humble croissant, and this one is so far above and beyond what you get anywhere else in Philly in terms of texture and flavor.  Super rich, buttery flavor and fluffy, pillowy goodness.  I had a croissant at Metropolitan Bakery (which - not to bad mouth them, I like a lot of their stuff) shortly afterwards, and the difference in quality is huge.   My personal favorite is the Paris Philadelphia, which has a lovely hazelnut cream filling that is just the perfect amount of sweetness.  Likewise, the eclair and chocolate tart have this subtle richness to them - so different than the overly cheap sweet stuff in other places.  Really can't go wrong with anything they have.\n\nThe Service:  Really friendly staff and good service.\n\nSpace and Pace: I love the interior of the cafe.  It's a lot of white colors mixed with a little bit of yuppie decor, and with a lot of window space, it's just very bright and positive energy.  It's different than a lot of other cafes, which often have a bit more of a darker industrial look (which looks cool too, but I think is better suited for a bar than a cafe).  It's just a great place to meet up or do some writing on the laptop, and usually not overly crowded."

Its a brightly lit space that is quiet enough to sit and chat with friends or even use as a study/work space. It is rather small though so I'm not sure whether or not it'd be conducive to a lot of people working.\n\nPastry wise the fare is pretty average. The 4 star rating includes the ambiance and location as otherwise, I'd probably rate closer to a 3.5 on food alone. I got a Paris Philadelphia, which to me is just a Paris-Brest with a strange name. Flavor-wise it was good, strong praline/hazelnut flavor in the cream. My friend thought the cream could be lighter but I've never had trouble downing just chunks of butter so personal preference. The choux pastry felt a bit soggy and not as light and crisp as I'd prefer, but this may just be because I got one towards the later afternoon so it was probably sitting out for some time. Overall, it was a good pastry, nothing standout and pretty one note.\n\nThe same could be said about the Lemon tart. Again, the flavor was strong of lemon and there was acidity but it was very one note. Nothing special or stand out with this pastry either. The tart base itself was pretty well made, held up to the custard well and kept its texture. My friend made a comment that the custard felt grainy but I don't think I noticed it as I attributed the graininess to the tart itself.\n\nOverall, its a nice place to sit and chill and get a craving out if you're looking for some pastries."

I got the americano and a chouquette, which, along with their heart shaped napoleon seem to be their best selling items. Starting with the chouquette, the inside had this super good chocolate cream that's cold, creamy, and not too sweet that was complimented well by the flaky pastry on the outside. The americano was really good as well! It had a good smoky dark flavor to it that I appreciate in my coffees. \n\nAnyways I appreciate that this place has provided the city, especially the midtown area with a much needed French caf\u00e9! Great place to come to catch up with friends or just read a book. Good coffee and good baked goods, not much more I could ask for."

The counter staff were friendly and polite.\n\nEvery time a French bakery opens up in  the area, it's over precious and this is no exception.  What I mean by precious it is all white gleaming counter tops and 3 pastries.  I'd like to see a French bakery crowded with bread and pastries.  If you are a representative of Laduree or Dallyou reading this, open near Rittenhouse Square.  You will get business that now goes to New York.\n\nUpdate - after initially posting this review I continued on a quest for what I was looking for, trying four other French patisseries and found it at Le Petit Mitron in Narberth.  So if you are looking for a more traditional patisserie try that."

After visiting Paris it is hard for us to order croissants from anywhere else (yes I am that kind of snob now) so we decided on a crepe and baguette with jam and butter.  A place that can make simple bread and butter tastes good always is an excellent mark for a place in my book.  I would eat that baguette everyday and be happy.  I think it is hard to mess up a crepe and this one hit the spot for us, went for a simple raspberry lemon one.  Think this a lovely spot if you want to hang out and enjoy your coffee and breakfast on the weekend."

I've been looking for a decent French bakery in the area to hold a candle to my favorite place in Paris, so I ordered a pain au chocolat and an apple turnover. The bakery is very cute, offers a variety of desserts and serves La Columbe coffee. When I opened the bag to eat my pain au chocolat, I noticed that the bake was a little dark. The croissant was crisp with decent air pockets, but there was a bitter aftertaste that I didn't like, perhaps it was the chocolate, but I wasn't blown away. The apple turnover was soggy and filled with apple sauce. I was expecting the apple turnover to be filled with pieces of apple, but this was unappetizing and I could not finish it. This is a decent spot if you're looking for an \"ok\" pastry and some coffee, but this turned out to be a disappointment for me."

They have both French and sourdough. I can't speak to the sourdough ones, but the traditional French bread baguettes are so, so good.

Then, the lemon tart I ordered was placed in her bag and not mine, so we ended up sorting that out ourselves.

Layers of butter and dough were there and the filling was quite nice, not sickly sweet. The lemon tart was also okay. Honestly I feel it's basically a lemon bar in a cute shape with some meringue piped in a circle that was torched on top. It was a scorcher of a day, and sounded the most refreshing at the time, but maybe I just ordered wrong.\n\nOverall, a nice little place to stop by if you're craving pastries, but I wouldn't say after my first visit it's a destination sort of place.\n\n3.5 stars"

Cake was creamy and tasty but I was so underwhelmed with how unimpressively decorated the cake was ( my family was too). 6 measly cranberries which didn't even look like real sugared cranberries, no greenery etc. I've seen unprofessional cakes decorated better. When it's ordered for a holiday table it's especially disappointing. We got some croissants as well. They were pretty good but not as good as in the French bakery near me ( La Baguette Magique). I would be hesitant to order the cake for occasion again . However, I'd stop again for coffee and pastry if in the neighborhood and will update the review."

Interesting comparison to Delice et Chocolat in Ardmore. Pastries seem delicate and elegantly made. I could only find such well made pastries mostly in Asian run/theme bakeries such as Paris Baguette or Hamada-ya. Pastries are flaky and yet not too greasy. Cream is velvety smooth and not too sweat. Savory quiche is creamy but not overwhelmingly heavy. Draft Lette has similar taste as cold brew and no sour after taste. Most people might find its deserts are on the \"lighter\" side, but it's a place I would love to visit again."

I lived in Paris for a short time and since then it's been so hard to find pastries that I'm not secretly judging but this place is the real deal !!! I've spent the last 5 years trying to find somewhere like this and it is amazing that I have just around the corner from where I work.\n\nThe atmosphere is so inviting, I want their designer to come decorate my house for me. A really beautiful place to sit and have a coffee. And it's always so clean which is important. \n\nThe staff is extremely professional and prompt. I have never had even the slightest issue, and I frequent this place throughout the week. The owner is so friendly - AND SUPER HOT. I mean he looks like he should be on The Bachelor or something. And his French accent doesn't hurt his case either. But besides that, he always makes time to speak with his customers and he's simply a ray of sunshine. \n\nOverall, 10/10 would recommend and do recommend to everyone I know.

J'aime French Bakery has a great ambiance and the happy ghosts of the long gone Millenium Coffee (and Afterwords) that used to occupy the space.\nBright and cheerful, simple yet elegant - the visual appeal and feel is great.  I arrived early and my server was nice and cheerful, very helpful.  He seemed a bit chagrined when I purchased most of the stock that was set out - 3 each of: eclairs, pear tarts, orange tarts, blueberry tarts, 6 chocolate croissants, 4 sugar brioches, 3 chocolate brioches and two regular French baguettes.  It was too early for a few of the other items on the menu like the chocolate tartlet or the Paris Philadelphia.\nService was good and the pastries were overall pretty good and the baguettes were excellent.  One of our guests oversees the baking of croissants in France so he felt the chocolate croissant were a bit sloppy and as a baker of croissant and eclairs myself, I have to say I agreed.  They looked a bit hastily made but they tasted fine.  I still think that J'aime French Bakery was pretty good overall in spite of a few issues and so I still give them a 4."

J'aime is not bad but not so different from any decent bakery in Philadelphia such as Metropolitan.

I'm impressed that in a city not particularly known for its competitive viennoiserie, this place is French all around - from staff to its food, with attention to quality and executing the basics amazingly well.\n\nMy favorites have been the croissant and madeline, although it has been awhile since I have revisited. I'm glad I don't live nearby, because I'd make these items a daily part of my coffee routine. I think when they first opened, I filled an embarrassing number of punches in my punch card.\n\nThis place is worth supporting - you can see the hard work and thought put into executing their vision for a French bakery oasis, serving pastry striving to be as good as you'd get in French-speaking cities, among the hustle and bustle of Philly."

The shop is cute, bright, and has a good amount of indoor seating space, perfect for a coffee date or if you're looking for a place to study or get work done. For the budget conscious viennoiserie lover, they also sell bags of day old croissants (3 for $3).\nThe plain croissant is light, crisp, flaky, buttery, and has a decent crumb. The same can be said for the others. The almond croissant is interesting since it seems like the frangipane is rolled and baked in the croissant instead of being filled into a sliced open croissant, which gives it a different texture - not inherently a better or worse thing. The olive oil cake is rich and moist without reading as too dense on the palate (honestly surprised since it's pretty hefty and the oil seeps through the bag lol), though I'm not sure how I feel about the poppy seeds since they sometimes can be a little too crunchy/grainy.\nOverall, I think J'aime is worth checking out - the pastries are good, the decor is welcoming, and it's priced pretty on par with the other bakeries in the area."

Well look no further: J'aime French Bakery is the spot for you.\nThis small cafe/bakery on 12th street has some of the best french patisseries in town: ranging from fluffy and airy croissants, to perfectly filled eclairs, and buttery tartlets. I'm a sucker for chocolate croissants, and this place has the best ones I've found in Philadelphia. You can see and taste the separate layer of the pastry, and the outside has a perfect slightly crispy texture. The bittersweet chocolate inside is also delicious. If you're lucky enough to be at the bakery when they're baking a fresh batch, you can even score one hot out of the oven! I believe there are also some savory pastry options, but I have yet to try these. \nThey also have a variety of coffee options encompassing espresso drinks and la colombe drafts; you'll definitely find something to get your caffeine fix. \nThe ambiance is also something to note! The windows and white decor make the space very open and inviting. While some coffee shops feel cramped by copious tables and scarce light bulbs, this one feels comfortable and spacious. If you can get a table by the windows, you can even people-watch (one of my favorite activities)!\nOverall, going to J'aime is a delightful experience--both for the food and the atmosphere."

At $3.25 it isn't cheap but certainly a good price for breakfast if you're a light eater. It is flaky on the outside, and on the inside it's so soft that it's difficult to discern one delicate layer from the next. It's also lined with a light almond paste and coated with roasted sliced almonds. Hands down the best croissant I've had outside of Europe.

I've been searching for smoked salmon on a baguette for years trying to recreate that experience when I was in Europe and this was by far the closest I've gotten. Everything was great quality.\nThe views are also great, it's nice having the buildings engulf your sight while you're eating. \nALSO! I left my drink there for some reason and I actually came back to get it and they had saved it for me!!! Like how sweet is that? And the owner was cracking jokes about it. Small stuff like that seems so insignificant but I swear it brightened up my day. Made my crazy life more bearable!! Best way to gain a returning customer. Be sure to check them our, you won't be disappointed!!"

I expected the Apple pastry to be soft but it was actually sugared carmelized and it was so incredible! The Napoleon pastry was perfectly flaky with a beautiful creme! Finally - just a simple Caramel latte with added vanilla was FANTASTIC coffee! If I lived in Philly- I would be a regular no question! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

However, one pastry caught my attention - the chocolate pretzel. It's a croissant, shaped like a pretzel, with a smooth chocolate ganache running through it, and small baked almonds sprinkled on top. I bought one, left the store and began walking and eating the pastry. The light, buttery croissant, the velvety texture of the ganache and crunchy almond, stopped me in my tracks a few blocks away. I turned around.........and walked back for another (which I ate today)\nYou don't find pastry gems like this one very often...I'll be back soon!"

Here's what I got\n\nOrange Olive Bread: \nMoist and filled with delicious poppy seeds, this was the surprise of the trio of pastries we got. With a hint of citrus, it was balanced and delicious!\n\nLemon Tart: \nTopped with meringue peaks, the lemon tart was a little bit too sweet for my liking. The texture and presentation though were spot on!\n\nMerveilleux:\nCreamy, rich, and not too sweet, this meringue ball of joy was the highlight of our snack here. Yummy!\n\nI highly recommend coming here to check out this spot and experiencing the great vibes and pastries if you're ever in the area!"

I got a millefeuille, which they call also un-Frenchly call a Napoleon, and it had only one layer of custard between two thick layers of pastry sheets. In a true millefeuille, you are supposed to get a nice mixture of the pastry part and the custard part with each bite, but with this there was too much dry pastry in one part of my mouth while the custard was in another. For $5.50, it was a significant disappointment. I'll be sticking to Miel for my pastries from now on."

I bought 7 pastries (each of their croissants, a heart-shaped napoleon, an eclair and an orange tart) and a small latte for a little over $30.\n\nThe latte was good but nothing extraordinary compared to the bakery items.\n\nThe interior is honestly so beautiful. The simple yet sophisticated white-walled design is perfect. And they even put decorations for Christmas! A little effect place to catch up with friends! A nice place for brunch.\n\nWhy only 4 stars? Honestly the service wasn't amazing in my opinion. The cashier did her job but she wasn't that friendly. But she wasn't unfriendly either. No WiFi either :(\n\nWould come again!"

Each delicate pastry was as delicious as the next. Amazing flakey layers of delight! The cream filled items were a favorite, however, honestly everything was a favorite. If you can pick up a variety of the $6 pastries you won't be disappointed.

It is pretty darn cute! Very clean and chic, with floor to sealing windows at the front which bring in a lot of sunlight. \n\nAs soon as you walk in, you'll see some perfectly baked and beautifully arranged pastries - your eyes are sure to get a treat! Everything looks fantastic! I would normally go for a chocolatey pastry, but since it was my first bite of the day, I was feeling something savory... alas the quiche. I was informed that the quiche can go fast, so I wasn't going to risk not being able to try it!\n\nAfter one of the sweet staff members warmed it up for me like I asked, she brought it out to the table. Simply put: it was divine. The quiche was flakey and oh so tasty. It came with a side salad (fresh spinach and tomatoes with dressing), but to be honest, it was really hard to focus on the salad with that quiche on the side.\n\nI'm sure I'll be returning to J'aime again when I want to treat myself. I'm not sure what I'll get though. It would be difficult to pass up on that quiche, but I'm also very interested in trying one of their pastries. Perhaps I'll do a little indulging and get both? Who knows! All I know is, J'aime, I'm coming for ya!"

Bright, clean, and new-- with a hint of industrial. Very inviting and nice to come in and sit. Airy and open. \n\nThe service was great- the barista was great about explaining different options and was extremely friendly. \n\nI enjoyed the 'black and tan' -- la Colombe iced black coffee with the la colombe draft latte (nitrogen foamed latte) on top -- makes for a very tasty, frothy drink. I also had the chouquette with Nutella cream -- YUM. Flaky, airy pastry with rich Nutella cream in the center. A perfect complement to the bitter coffee. \n\nOnly thing I can knock this place on is price-- two small coffees and the one pastry came out to $15, so it's more than I'd typically pay for something comparable. \n\nOverall, a great experience. Definitely recommend stopping in!"

The clean white look can work in some situations, but I feel like it usually needs some warm wood tones to balance it out, and J'aime is lacking that. It's just pure white, and it seems very un-French and cold. However, the pastries are delicious and very French. I really wanted a millefeuille/Napoleon but they had none, so I tried a Paris Philadelphia, which was a rectangle of hazelnut chocolate delectability. I also had hot tea, but oddly, though they appear to sell loose-leaf, they served me a bag of not-whole-leaf tea. France was way ahead of the States with loose-leaf (it was where I learned to love it!), so I feel like J'aime should up their game. I also got a sourdough baguette to go; it was pretty good, but not worth going out of your way for. Come for the p\u00e2tisseries!"
