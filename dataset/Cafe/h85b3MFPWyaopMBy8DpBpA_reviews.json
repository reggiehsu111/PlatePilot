Its been some time since I have frequented this restaurant, I stopped going for sometime because the food became very inconsistent.\n\nFast forward to today, i decided to stop by since some years had passed.  I ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings...  I just have to say that i was VERY disappointed. The oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat... more fat than meat and small portions at that...the rice was stale.  But what was really disappointing was the jerk wings.. I took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken..  I just couldn't believe that an establishment would serve this....i assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out... they just cant... there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food.  I was right to stay away for years, and i will be doing so again..."

And we ordered the SMALL portions.\n\nNow, as with any restaurant with good food it goes without saying that word travels.  As a result this place is always packed. ALWAYS. \nThe line remains at two lengths: at the door or out the door.  So if you're impatient or adhering to the \"fast food\" mentality when it comes to restaurants, you may want to go elsewhere. \n\nBut if you are willing to wait, it's oh so worth it."

There were about 5 people in line when I arrived and my order was taken within minutes. There were 3 people taking orders and the line moved very quickly. I loved the fact that they kept the food coming out. As I stood there, a new pan of mac and cheese and yams came out fresh and hot, not like some restaurants where they run out of food or make you wait forever for food to be made. The jerk chicken was well seasoned and moist, the oxtail was good, the mac and cheese was REAL mac and cheese and was delicious. The plantain was sweet, moist, perfectly ripe and the best I've had in the city so far. Candied yams are my favorite food so I am very picky and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the yams as well....fresh, sweet, real yams (not the canned stuff some restaurants give you). Ron's I will definitely be back even though I have to travel about 40 minutes to get there. Worth the trip! 5 stars!"

Portion sizes are HUGE so if you order a large, know that it will fill two people, or last you for two meals  (I ate it for lunch and dinner). I ordered the ox tails with rice, Mac n cheese, yams, and a piece of cornbread all for JUST $16.50! It was the BEST I've had in a long time and this includes the Caribbean food I get in NYC. I highly recommend this place as the curry shrimp, jerk chicken, and all of their dishes look amazingly delicious! It is more of a takeout spot, though we did sit inside and eat. The tables just aren't kept very clean so you'd be better off to pick it up and eat at home."

Everything was super SALTY! I per chased ox tails, curried goat, and jerk chicken. PROS-OX TAILS were tender. CONS-they were very small. The very end of the tail. salty and the gravy tasted like a doctored version of the real thing. The best gravy however of the three. PROS- GOAT was tender. CONS- goat was SALTY. No other veggies in the pot. If they added a carrot or some potatoes it would have helped with the saltiness. Would have been the best gravy if it was not so salty and inedible. I threw it away. PROS- JERK CHICKEN was a good serving size. CONS-Not enough jerk flavor. They need to marinate the chicken in the jerk sauce. It was just plain bland. The worse part is they added some cheap barbeque sauce on the chicken and called it jerk sauce. HORRIBLE! Ruined the entire meal! If you get the jerk chicken DO NOT get the sauce! Cabbage was BLAND! Beans and rice a big disappointment. A poorly made version with poor ingredients. Tasted like minute rice. The give you a lot of rice and beans especially in the extra large serving of ox tails. The meat to rice ratio was just unfair. I felt cheated. I will not recommend!\n\n There was a short wait considering the place was crowded. It looked like organized chaos. The servers were clean, in uniform and their heads were netted. GOOD. They were pleasant also because the masses were kind of difficult. The cooks were dressed in chef whites. Nice touch. Well stocked variety of drinks and desserts. Very clean.  I left thinking I have found my new Jamaican cuisine home. NOT!  THE FOOD WAS JUST BAD. REALLY BAD! BAD!"

I bought a large meal with Jerk Chicken, beans/rice and string beans. They have a variety of sauces you can add to put onto of your rice. I got the ox tail sauce. I also added some fried fish on the side for only $2.00. The meat was tender and fresh just like I expected. The only downside is that the meat is missing that special spice I was expecting to taste with Jamaican food. It taste great but not very Jamaican flavored. The fish was sooooooo good and crunchy. I could probably eat all day. It could of used a bit more spice but I'm not complaining for the price and quality.  I split my meal and side fish with a friend and we were both full. Next time I will probably get a small meal or large (if I'm greedy) for myself. I will visit this place often because food is great and the prices are amazing. I went on a Sunday at about 4:00 and they were really busy. I waited for maybe 15 - 20 or so min. in a line. The staff was nice from what I encountered as well."

I was beyond disappointed.  The best thing about my meal was the prepackaged cornbread.

No matter what you get you'll be happy.\nSame can't be said about the time it takes to get your food. At first glance you might think the long lines you'll most likely encounter are due to the volume of business, owing to lots of people coming to get the great food. While standing in line you'll come to realize the lines are because the design of the traffic flow is horrific and waiting on each customer is a painfully slow process.  The redesign of the restaurant has made it worse which is the main reason there's always a line of faithful, patient customers.  \nThe new monitors that display the menu are pretty, but kind of far away from where you're standing in line so if you need glasses for distance don't forget to bring them. And frustratingly, once you've squinted enough to get a read on something, the screen \"refreshes\"; starts spinning around and a new image appears.  Because they don't have any written menus available to read while waiting in line, when you finally are served, you're faced with a lot of good food but uncertain of what goes together in the small or large dinner dishes, or the platter.  There's so many offerings you feel a bit silly asking the clerk to run down all that there is and end up just ordering anything so as not to aggravate the people waiting behind you.  The stations where you go for service don't make any sense and don't appear to have resulted from any meaningful planning; you can't see the full selection of offerings from most of them, so again, ordering is  guessing game.  My guess is most of the customers are regulars who end up ordering the same thing over and over without needing to see a menu.  The occasional or new customer will most likely be aggravated by the wait and the inability to figure out what's included with the combinations of offerings, or even what the sides are.  But the food is delicious!"

The interior was just remodeled so it's a lot newer than most take out spots. You immediately see those beautiful fried fish and jerk wings on display as you approach the counter. The other side of the counter is where all the sides are. \n\nThe ordering system is set up much like Boston market. You pick your protein and your sides. We got oxtails and stewed chicken, both with rice and beans and the sides were cabbage, okra and fried plantain.  The oxtails were good and clean in flavors, it wasn't oily, which is rare for this dish. It didn't exactly pop however, it was mild. The oxtails themselves were very tender. The chicken fell into the same category, food but missing something. The plantain were good, again, not oily. The okra is probably the only thing that was pretty generic, it was simply boiled.\n\nWe also ordered a side of fried fish. It was only $2 extra and it ate like a meal. The dish was very large and fried to a perfect crisp. The flavor was kind of flat however, I don't think they seasoned the flour enough. Over all though, it was a solid experience. Huge portions, friendly service, simple and easy to order menu.

        "text": "Update:  I have been to Ron's several times since my initial post.  As stated before, the chicken is good, although it is more grilled chicken rather than jerk.  Jerk chicken has a little spicy flavor that is marinaded over some time, which Ron's does not.  It is simply tasty grilled chicken.  I always order my chicken with no sauce and I have noticed that most people order with no sauce as well.  The sauce is BBQ sauce! Still, their veggies are good and hubby likes the ox tails a lot.  I would love to see Ron implement a real jerk sauce.\nI have patronized this establishment four or five times over the past couple of months.  My first visit I enjoyed the jerk chicken, but HATED their so called jerk sauce.  Not a problem, I just ask for no sauce.  The sauce is more like a bland, tasteless BBQ sauce, not at all like the consistency of true jerk sauce.  However the chicken was good as was the vegetable medley - that was when I got my food early in the evening.  The cabbage was also very tasteless, not at all like true Caribbean food.  However, it was not so bad that I could not work with the product until today!  \n\nI typically pick up my food by 6pm after getting off work and have never had a complaint that encouraged me to post a review on Yelp.   Tonight I  worked late and did not have time to cook and did not want a fast food dinner, so Ron's came to mind.  Bad mistake!!!!  The platter was comprised of bits and pieces of what should have been a breast, wing, etc.  What really got my blood boiling was the so called vegetable medley.  It was obvious that the medley got low by the time I ordered so they dumped a bag of carrots in the pot.  Not at all what I got the last time because I can not eat carrots.  Secondly, the fragments of chicken was overlooked / dried out.  And what made the bird twice as bad was the fact that they nilly willy slathered that so called jerk sauce over the chicken AND the veggies.  Hubby wanted to take it back, but I convinced him that it was not worth going back out at that time of the evening.  I know.... That is what a lot of businesses count on.  \n\nIn summary, I have enjoyed a few platters from Ron's.  However, if you like the true Jerk sauce, a) order early and b) request no sauce and put your own sauce on at home."

We had goat roti, curry shrimp, curry goat, stew chicken, oxtail, jerk chicken, and brown stew red snapper. My mother compared the Red snapper to one she had at the seaside in Jamaica.

The food is always great, but there seems to be a new manager, Lou, there who has no customer service skills. The first time I realized there was someone new there was when I phoned in an order and the man on the telephone was extremely rude. I brushed it off and figured someone was having a bad day. Yesterday, I called in my order and did not have a problem until I arrived. Lou told me they did not have an order for me. I explained that I called and he should check with the employees. He just gave me a look as if I were not telling the truth. I asked if he wanted to see the call log on my phone. He then accused me of yelling, which was far from the truth. I explained the music is loud in there so I wanted to make sure he could hear me. He eventually found my order. An employee wrote Ce Ce instead of Stacey. She probably could not hear me when I called in because of the loud music. I did not receive so much as an apology or anything. He just went to the\nback of the restaurant. \n\nI understand that mistakes happen but Lou should have investigated a little more before alluding to there not being an order for me. In addition, he does not seem to have the patience necessary to deal with a high paced restaurant such as Ron's. Each time I placed an order and came across Lou, I felt like I was not a respected customer. Unfortunately, I would rather travel a little further to Jamaica D's or Moonlight Cuisine for Caribbean food rather than to deal with rude employees."

So, I knew I would give in to my oxtail desires this week and it just so happens I had time to stop by Ron's today. \n\nI placed an order over the phone for a small oxtail platter with rice, peas, and cabbage. I also ordered a small jerk chicken platter with rice, peas, and string beans. Upon completion of my order, I was given a number and asked for my name. Upon arriving to the restaurant I noticed people standing all over the place. There was a barrier where people were supposed to stand, but no one was behind the barrier. I spoke to a fellow customer and he told me I needed to go up to the window and see if my food was ready. I stood there watching a woman call out random names then people would walk up to the window. Wow, talk about unorganized. Approximately 10 mins later, the woman returned to the window and asked if people wanted to check and see if there orders were ready. I gave my name and number. She closed the window and then I stood there for another 15 mins. Mind you, I drove from Jersey, which took 45 mins. So, between the 45 min drive, standing in the sun to approach the window, and standing around to get my food, I was over the experience. I kept thinking, \"if I just get my food and it's good, I'll be ok.\" My name was finally called. I paid $26 and left. \n\nWell, I drove back to Jersey to try my food. The platters were heavy, so there was a lot of food. Everything looked good, so that was great. We tried items from both platters. My food review is below.\n\nThe good: Platters  were filled with food. There was lots of gravy for the oxtails, rice & peas. \n\nThe not so good: My jerk chicken tasted just like my oxtails. The jerk sauce didn't really taste like jerk sauce and the chicken wasn't spicy. I don't know if someone poured the same gravy over the meat on both platters, but I didn't enjoy the gravy at all. The oxtails were just ok. I have had much better in and out of Philly. The cabbage was ok and the string beans were tasteless. Overall, I would not return to Ron's Caribbean Cuisine bc Kingston Philly is a much better option. Guess, I will drive the extra 4 mins to go there next time."

Well the salmon tasted like they kept is a week too long. It had a weird taste to it. And it wasn't like it was a spice I wasn't used to eating...this was a taste of old fish that had been cooked and lightly seasoned. (P.S. I was a pescatarian for 10 yrs...I know what old fish taste like) Between the one bite I ate and the one bite my mother ate, just to make sure it was just me who thought it was bad, 4/5 of the salmon filet was trashed.\nThe mac and cheese looked so unappealing. It was dry and waaaaaaay overcooked. Same deal...one bite from me and one from my mother....the rest was trashed. \nNow, the rice and peas was better. And this was simply because the oxtail gravy that was put on top was very very good!! Once I ate through the \"layer\" of rice and peas with the gravy, the rest went back to being unappealing....and in the trash it went!!\n\nSo overall, I wouldn't go back...unless it was to buy a bottle of ginger beer.

Professional, kind and the food was absolutely delicious. I brought my mother and father here with my best friend for dinner. The ox tail fell straight off the bone. The macaroni and cheese was actually macaroni AND cheese! The cabbage was good too. We had the fish and the plaintains too. I mean it was just delicious. I absolutely will be back again. Kudos to a well ran establishment."

The service is pretty typical for a Caribbean restaurant. Not very warm and friendly but they got the job done.\n\nOnly big complaint is the long wait. You literally have to wait in line for 30 minutes to get your food. You can't order delivery or takeout so there's no way to get around this. No clue why it takes so long given that most people are probably getting oxtail or jerk chicken with rice and peas and cabbage. You'd think they would just cook more at a time to accommodate the long lines but no. Also, the area where this restaurant is located isn't the nicest.\n\nGood food, though, so definitely worth it!"

I arrived with my co-worker 30 mins later looking to pay and recieve our platter;needless to say,  there weren't  any platters. Certain dishes were not available, so, we were asked to wait 10 mins. 20 mins later, no platters. Then I found out, because my complete order was not available, the staff sold food I had been waiting 40 mins for. On top of that, the young lady who was waiting on me was very rude. Finally,  I asked for a manager. Once I asked for my money back, the manager decided to try and hurry up my orders. My co-worker was able to get her platter.

I ordered the basa fish platter, really good price, love how quick and non-attitudey everyone is. BUT I received the smallest, itty, bitty pieces of fish for my platter. It probably seemed even smaller because I had like 50 scoops of rice and about 60 scoops of canned string beans on my platter. Don't over compensate my platter with an insane amount of sides.

The fish is the best thing they sell is it perfectly seasoned and fried to perfection. They sell it individually or in a platter. I also got the BBQ wings, I do with they were cooked a little harder, but that's a personal preference so I wont complain much about that. The sauce was really good and the wings were covered in sauce which was nice since some places are extremely skimpy on the sauce. It is in a super busy area with businesses up and down the street and parking is pretty bad so be prepared to park on a side street or circle the block a few time or if you want to test your chances with PPA you can illegally park. \n\nDuring COVID they do have signs that promote social distancing but most people in line don't really adhere to it. I would just suggest they have someone out there directing patrons on where to stand and the line is always long. \n\nYou do have to call ahead right now to get your food and you cannot order at the window. This process was very easy and I had no difficulties. They even asked how far away I was when I ordered so that my food would be freshly prepared and packaged and not sitting there which I appreciated. \n\nOverall I think everyone should try this place and give the fish a try."

Luckily the guy behind me eventually got through and offered me the opportunity to put in my order as well. A lot of people standing on line were also having issues with getting their calls answered. The guy at the window advised them to \"keep trying\". Certainly frustrating to see patrons roll up after you but manage to get their call in ahead of you.
