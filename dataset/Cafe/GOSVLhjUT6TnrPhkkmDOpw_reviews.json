I ordered the honeybee crepe and an almond croissant. I'm one to typically bring leftovers home but the food was so delicious there was nothing left to take much to the surprise of my friends. There is a small seating area downstairs and some window seating on the first floor. I'd recommend getting there on the earlier side if you're with a group and want to sit. I'd also recommend this for smaller groups. Will definitely be going back."

I'll definitely be coming back to try the rest of their menu!"

I also would have liked a side salad with that.  I stole my partner's and it was fresh and good.  I ordered a cortado and received something more similar to a latte -- espresso-milk ratio was too milk-heavy.  The space is nice, but was very smoky both upstairs and downstairs.  Don't come here if you have asthma?\n\nOverall, a friendly, cozy place with good food.  Crepes (and omelettes) are pretty massive, so if i come back i'll likely get something to split."

I walked past Vineyards Cafe and did a double-take at the inviting, Nordic-like interior.  But I was running late and did not get to try it.  Then, the holidays came and I had to file Vineyards Cafe away...until yesterday.\n\nThe interior is clean and beautifully lit.  It makes for an inviting space to enjoy breakfast.  The owners are welcoming and friendly.  The menu small but more than sufficient.  The coffee (La Coloumbe) was excellent, crisp and fresh.  I ordered an egg sandwich with cheese and opted for the French Baguette (you can have it on a bagel as well).\n\nMy breakfast was a fantastic start to 2016, particularly on this first, cold day of work of the year.  The bread was excellent.  My eggs were cooked to perfection.  The cheese was melty and plentiful (perhaps a little too much cheese but I'll never really utter those words again).  There is a water station that looked thirst-quenching and extremely well-kept.\n\nIf I could, I'd park myself in the beautiful downstairs every day to work and eat.  Thanks, Vineyards Cafe for making my day and getting my 2016 off to a smooth start.  Buen provecho, Yelpers."

(I would have missed it completely if it wasn't for the \"open\" sign.) When you enter, whether you want your meal to stay or go, you must order and pay upstairs. I went with the Norwegian (goat cheese, salmon and avocado) while my fianc\u00e9 went with the Goat Turkey (goat cheese, turkey, fig spread). I also ordered the blood orange pear tea and he got the lime mint wellness. The prices were quite reasonable, even with 15% tip everything came up to~$25. \nYou have to wait upstairs for your tea as they will bring the food to where you are seated but not the tea. We waited then took our cups downstairs. \n\nThere aren't a ton of tables downstairs (or upstairs). About 2-3 two person tables and maybe 2 four person tables...were also 2 armchairs near a low table. It is quite intimate and closed in. There were a lot of what looked to be Temple college students and the place did seem to have that chill atmosphere that students would gravitate toward.  \n\nWe didn't have to wait too long for our crepes. They were QUITE filling, you only need one at a time! The Norwegian was ok, there was way too much goat cheese for me and it seemed to overpower everything. The Goat turkey was amazing, loved the fig spread, it added some balance. The herbal teas were also enjoyable (I recommend adding a sugar cube to the blood orange pear to really bring out the blood orange flavor). \n\nI enjoyed the nice touches like the lemon-cucumber ice water stations (one upstairs and one downstairs). Very refreshing. \nThere was single gender neutral, differently abled friendly bathroom upstairs. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely like to come back to try the sweet crepes."

Myself and one other person shared 2 crepes, an iced coffee, and a side of bacon, all DELICIOUS. We had the honeybee and the apricot comfiture. While I'm not a fan of cheese or eggs, the honeybee seemed to be such unique mix of tastes so we decided to try it, and I was pleasantly surprised. The apricot was also a delicious choice, and the mix of one savory and one sweet flavor were a nice blend. They also offer fruit infused water as a courtesy, which was a very sweet touch. Overall I was glad I found this gem, and I would certainly recommend it."

I was pleasantly surprised to find out there's a floor downstairs with some extra tables and even couches! The aesthetic does what it can to be hip/trendy. It is also very clean and bright which I love. \n\nVineyards seems to be known for their crepes, but I didn't get to try one during my first trip here. I got a hot latte. It was $6!!! That is v expensive for a cup of coffee and if I'm being honest it was not that good. That got me a bit turned off. My friend got a mocha chino which was just as expensive and a chocolate chip cookie.\n\nI don't wanna hate on a local small business, so even though I do think that this place is overpriced, I'm gonna back it.  I'll definitely be back to give a crepe a try and recommend it if you need a cup of coffee or a place to get some work done."

The little cafe is situated in a weird (but up and coming) neighborhood - super close to my boyfriend's house. I was so excited to try!\n\nTheir sandwiches are good. Their crepes (we ordered take-out) got soggy after the 4 minute walk home! It seems like they make their crepes a little watered down, so I noticed a lot of air bubbles when taking a bite of the crepe. It wasn't anything special and the ingredients were a little lacking. \n\nTheir drinks menu could be a little more creative, but for a small place like this, I think it's pretty good.

The owners took a bit of a gamble by opening this fantastic european style corner cafe at 16th and Ogden amidst a ton of residential development.  After watching the place fill up to the brim today, I think they made a smart move by fulfilling a need here in the Francisville community.  \n\nThe space is bright, clean and feels comfortable with all the reclaimed wood.  The upstairs doesn't have much space, but surprisingly, there's a cozy garden level seating area below.  The menu consists of savory and sweet crepes, sandwiches, salads and a few omelets.  The drink menu is diverse, and while we don't drink coffee, everyone else seemed to be enjoying it.  \n\nWe loved the ham, gouda and walnut with maple syrup crepe.  (It was a little bit better than the crepes we had in Paris.)  The Norwegian crepe was loaded with goat cheese, smoked salmon and avocado, and the ricotta/caramel variety had just the right amount of sweetness.  \n\nWe'll be back for sure and we wish them the best of luck as a cornerstone eatery in the neighborhood.  As the density continues to fill in, I'm certain they will be in good company."

It makes you feel you are in your own leaving room.\n\nTea and coffee are very good and their crepes are delicious, although I am giving 4 stars because I ordered a Nutella crepe but it was not fully Nutella, it was more of a mix between Nutella and chocolate syrup, I was expecting pure Nutella filling (as the name says) and not a mix of chocolates so that was a bit disappointing."

There's also more room downstairs but we never got a chance to check it out. Both servers were very friendly. This place really does feel like your neighborhood cafe, just like their sign says!\n\nI ordered the Norwegian crepe. These were really packed with salmon and avocado.  I never had this combination of foodstuffs together before, but it somehow works. Even my girlfriend who admittedly doesn't like goat cheese or avocados commented on how much she liked the dish. \n\nI was also able to try a bite or two of her caramel ricotta crepe. Also very delicious and not too sweet. Would be interested in coming back here to try more of their crepes and some of their coffee."

Today my friend called me to tell me about his experience here with the young lady at the counter speaking rudely to him. Ironically, a few months ago I had a negative experience with this same young lady as well. I had ordered a Vanilla Iced Chai and was handed a warm chai (in the middle of the summer). When I told her that I wanted ice in it she told me that I didn't ask for ice. I know for sure that i asked for ice, I wouldn't drink a hot drink on a hot summer day. Anyhow, I assured her that I did ask for it and perhaps she did not hear me. She insisted that I did not ask for ice, I sensed her attitude and decided not to go any further because I did not feel like arguing about a drink. Today, he saw a notice that they were not serving eggs and asked her about it, she responded in a rude tone \"We just don't?\" It was unnecessary and unprofessional for her to give him attitude for asking a simple question. Well, this prompted us to find out on our own. Come to find out they were in violation of code and had to cease cooking eggs immediately. That was no big deal for me, but when I read that there was no backflow prevention on the sink water supply lines, that made the decision for me. I would think that a business who's been cited with various violations would be more humble when dealing with customers. It was a nice run while it lasted and it's sad to remove them from my list of favs but with the violations and the attitude, I'm good love, enjoy!"

They also shared they typically do not recommend crepes for delivery, as they should be eaten within a few minutes of being prepared. All that said, I respect him reaching out and respectfully adding context. Kudos for good customer service. \n\nWe ordered delivery this morning, we are so so so disappointed. First, we found out they were out of 3 of the 6 items we ordered - blackberry jam for a crepe, fresh OJ, and one of the other crepes. In the end, we picked the sucre crepe, Norwegian crepe, crepe with apricot jam, everything bagel with fig jam, and an iced coffee drink. The only thing that was good was the bagel and coffee. I don't understand all the reviews praising these crepes as special. I know this will sound super pretentious, but I have had crepes in France and at many places in CA - none of them have tasted as poorly as these. All 3 were lacking flavor and the consistency/style of crepe was  not appetizing, plain, not crispy, more brown colored, and lacking. The Norwegian has salmon, goat cheese, and avocado - the salmon was overpowering, while a good quantity of protein is usually welcome, this was super fishy and with a lack of flavor/spices, it was as if rating straight salmon, not a crepe with other ingredients. The plain with apricot jam was like soaking up apricot syrup with a plain piece of bread and the sucre one didn't even taste of sugar, I couldn't even see the sugar inside.I dislike giving low reviews, but I am confused why this has high reviews which misled us and was why we ordered here. We all have different taste buds and preferences, this was our experience, hopefully others enjoy this place."

I wasn't a big fan of the interior space, it was rather lackluster, though it let in a lot of sunlight. There was seating out front and downstairs but the main area itself (which is where we were situated) was rather small and had one outlet on the other end of the room. If you're going to come here to work, I advise grabbing the one seat by the outlet or bringing a fully-charged laptop. \nThere's free wifi and it's pw-protected, which is great.\nVineyards offers lots of different beverages, baked goods, and sweet and savory crepes. My friend and I only ordered two chai lattes, which tasted like your typical coffeeshop chai latte, so nothing really mind-blowing. The owners were very polite, which was nice.
