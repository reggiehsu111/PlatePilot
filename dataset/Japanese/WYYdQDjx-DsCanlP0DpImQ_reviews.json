We got two rounds of sushi. \n\nWe came in on a Monday around 7:30pm and we were the only ones there! Started to fill up by 8:30pm. Good for parties of 2-5 as he tables are smaller. \n\nQuality of fish was great, everything tasted amazing! I deducted one star because there was only one waiter and one sushi chef. Getting our food took painfully long as people started to come in. If you're looking for a good deal and quality sushi this is the place. Be prepared to wait for your food though. \n\nI'll be back!!"

The eel is so fresh and has perfect traditional eel-soy sauce taste. The waitress told me that they use the expensive kind of eel from market. I believe it cause you can really taste that!\nI also like the J special roll, has tuna at top. The sophisticated texture of each layer give your tongue a luxurious massage.\nFor the appetizer, Seaweed salad is the one you won't wanna miss. Very Japanese, fresh and chewy arouse your appetite. The fried dumpling is just fried so perfect, the light crispy bottom is just... professional!!\nLast but not least, service is so good! Take care you you very much. They let us see how they made food at open bar, which is interesting! \nAlready be their loyal customer!"

For rolls we ordered recommended Fuji and black dragon rolls, to my surprises their eel were so good and no smell like other places.  For appetizer we ordered an item called avocado dumpling, Omg! It got just ripe avocado that melt in your mouth, inside avocado wrapping it had mixes of various fishes with a little spicy house sauce. I also like the garnishment and plating in that they used dried ice and shaved ices to preserve the freshness, finally i liked their attentive services that made you feel at home. If you like some special fishes and yet with quality and nice display of their skill set or varieties you should stop by and try out. I also was told they will bring in authentic Japanese ramen soon. We will definitely come back. Overall good job to their chefs and good luck to this newly open sushi store at the center city."

Having perused the menu online several times I knew I wanted the fried oysters $7). Just the idea was too good to pass up. I prefer Sashimi to Sushi. I want to savor the fish and not the surroundings.The server suggested the baby yellow fin special ($17, a little pricey) and I agreed.\nThe oysters arrived nicely garnished. The taste and the texture climb to the ethers. Just a perfect dish.  The baby yellow fin appeared on a lovely wide dish garnished with radish, cucumber, yellow caviar and tiny dice-like cubes of dragon fruit.

I picked shrimp tempura, eel cucumber, and spicy salmon with a bowl of miso soup. The order was ready quick and packed well. The soup was super tasty and the rolls were all great quality for takeout sushi. \n\nClose to work for me so I'll definitely be getting this another time."

I can tell right away they are using fresh and high quality vendor and the taste is so good. It is probably the best sushi I ever had in Center city. But the price is very reasonable. For the quality you get, I can only think of one restaurant in Center city is comparable to it with 30% more expensive. I hope neighborhood and foodie can find out this place and their business should pick up shortly. It is a BOYB"

First time ordering from J Sushi and I'm super impressed by the presentation and taste! \n\nI ordered four rolls to try: romantic roll, popular roll, spicy tuna, and Philadelphia roll. Each one has its own distinct taste so it doesn't feel like I'm eating the same roll. The salmon and tuna is super fresh and the pineapple in the romantic roll is super yummy with the soypaper.\n\nWill definitely be ordering from here again :)"

I honestly forgot what we got but we ordered like 5 dishes (2 of them appetizers/soup) and it was all good. Take out Morimoto and Double Knot, which caters to a different demographic, I'd say this is my new go to Sushi place in Philly. \n\nDrinks - BYOB! Aka awesome\n\nOverall - I have to admit that with so many sushi places in Center City not named Morimoto's or Double Knot, I figured this place would just blend into the other places. To my pleasant surprise, that wasn't the case.\n\nJ Sushi was such a pleasant surprise. My wife and I made it over on a Sunday evening. We were the only table there which was a shame because the service and food were so good. We hope to be back soon. \n\nPoints for: Service, overall food\nNo negatives."

You get 21 pieces of sushi and two specialty rolls. The fish was very fresh and delicious, and the presentation was beautiful! It comes with a soup, a salad (yes, only one of each ) and edamame. There were other deals as well, but I'm almost certain we will be getting the Sushi Party every time!\n\nOh! I almost forgot! If you pay with cash you get 10% off! So our favorite huge dish was suddenly $54 instead. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better"

Don't worry, it turned out okay. \n\nI was very impressed by the sushi. As you can see from the photos attached to this review, everything looked so beautiful and artful. \n\nThe food itself was very good. Left feeling very satiated. \n\nThe dishes came out quickly though that's possibly because we were the only ones there. \n\nBYOB!"

The avacodo dumpling was awesome and all the sushi I ordered had fantastic subtle garnish that I thought complemented each if the types if fish very well. My wife ordered to specialty rolls, both of which had awesome flavors and very nice presentation. Would recommend to anyone near center city."

We both were hankering sushi and he had this in his bookmark collection.  \n\nI have no complaints about J Sushi.  It can get a little pricey but nothing we did not expect when deciding to eat here.  If I remember correctly there might have been a discount if you paid with cash (???) but I already knew I was paying with credit so I did not pay attention well enough.  \n\nAs always we decided to share everything so that meant we ordered more than we needed to, but it was delicious all the same.  We started with the Kani Salad (Spicy crabmeat, cucumber, crunchy, masago) and it was a perfect amount for two to share since other entrees were coming.  Very fresh ingredients and a great starter.  For our main courses we got the Sashimi Deluxe (18 pcs assorted raw fish and served with miso soup or green salad) and the Pick 3 Special Rolls.  The rolls we ordered were:\n\n-American Dream: Eel, avocado, cream cheese topped with crunchy spicy tuna, in house special sauce\n-Naruto Roll: Salmon, tuna, white fish, crab stick, avocado, masago wrapped in cucumber with house special sauce\n-No. 1 Roll: Eel, crabmeat, cucumber topped with salmon, tuna, avocado in house special sauce\n\nI would highly recommend any of these rolls, especially the Naruto Roll.  It is very different than any roll I have ever had since it was wrapped in cucumber.  It had its own special flare.\n\nThe server was very pleasant and the ambiance is on point.  Our bill was kind of pricy but we really didn't need three rolls to share especially because the Sashimi Deluxe also came with miso soup or salad."

We actually stumbled upon this place by accident while looking for parking for another restaurant we were going to. My boyfriend noticed the sign for a special they were running so he said let's just check it out. We both are sushi lovers and thought the menu and pricing were appeasing and decided to stay. \n\nThis place is by far the best and gets five stars  because of the THREE key things: \n\n-the size of the individual pieces are HUGE (more bang for your buck which is key because sushi takes a lot to fill you up), \n\n-prices are good especially for it's location. (If you're not from Philadelphia Center City is a tourist location which means most businesses jack up pricing) \n\n-the taste is so fresh and well prepared. Don't even get me started on the presentation, along with the service, is why we came back this past Wednesday after MONTHS of talking about this place.\n\n\nTrust the place must be amazing if a person takes the time to write a LENGTHY good review. People usually only do this when they complain. Lol hope this helps."
