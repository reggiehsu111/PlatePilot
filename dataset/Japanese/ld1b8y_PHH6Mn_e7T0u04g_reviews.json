Poke bowl was a huge portion.\n\nAfter some questionable poke in Montreal this week, I was starting to get worried that good poke was only a West Coast thing. Fortunately, I was wrong. This was not exactly a traditional poke bowl (kind of a lot of carrots and corn), but the ingredients were fresh and high-quality, and the portion size was very generous. I think their $16 poke bowl was literally twice as large as a $13 poke bowl would be in Seattle, and these are airport prices!\n\nService was not super speedy, especially since I was there in the early afternoon when there was a staff changeover, and it seemed like they usually have fewer customers at that time of day but today it was pretty busy. If you're in a hurry, you can order anything off the menu to go (or there are premade sushi containers in a fridge, whose quality I can't vouch for)."

Overall, a promising lunch venue especially if you want a nice bowl of noodles. They have two locations; today I went to the one at Terminal A.\n\nAMBIANCE: (8.5/10)  It is a nice small quick stop restaurant with a nice bar seating area if you aren't in a rush.  The location is very quaint and in one of less busy parts of the airport, so it's a great place if you want a bit of quiet in the airport. I felt like I was able to relax and enjoy my meal without having to rush or worry about loud announcements interrupting my meal. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: (9/10) The staff is very friendly and attentive. I was offered seating promptly and my order was taken quickly. All the seating options were properly set up and had a very nice and clean presentation. Food came out in roughly 10 mins, so great timing on their part. \n\nFOOD: (7/10) \nTonkatsu Ramen with Pork and Boiled Egg ($13 +$2 for the egg)\nI previously saw some mixed reviews mentioning the ramen, so I decided to try it myself. It came out as a sizable portion, and I only managed to eat about 2/3 of it. It comes with only 3 pieces of meat, so I wish it came with more but it was reasonable. The meat was a bit chewy, but it still had lots of seasoning and flavor in it. The boiled egg was also very good although it tasted a bit salty. Overall the flavor of the super was powerfully flavorful but with a bit too much sodium for my personal tasting. This includes the broth which felt a little overbearing. Aside from the extra sodium that I tasted the other flavors worked very well together. The broth was nice and hot which was perfect for this cold day and it mixed well with the veggies (great complementary texture) along with the flavors from the meat. It would have been a higher rating from me if there were a bit more meat and a little less salty taste."

And we're glad we did. \n\nWe ordered the Miso Ramen with Pork and the Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. The ramen was surprisingly tasty and could hold up as \"good ramen\" at almost any decent ramen spot in Los Angeles. It had everything you'd want in terms of flavor and consistency of the broth, soft boiled egg. And the noodles themselves were cooked very nicely. Tasted authentic. Don't let the presentation of the to-go bowl mislead you. It was good ramen. The Chicken Teriyaki Bowl was just ok. There was too much of the teriyaki sauce which was not too good. We wish we had ordered 2 ramens. \n\nThere is bar seating and a TV to pass the time. They also serve sake and wine. It seemed like a two person operation here, but the service was above average. The food came out quickly - less than 5 minutes after ordering. \n\nIf ever back in Terminal A, I'll be returning to Gachi for the ramen."

The broth--which is most important part of a ramen experience-was kinda bland, just salty with a touch of pepper, but not complex and umami-ish the way good broth should be.  And it was not really what I expect as \"tonkatsu\" (pork cutlet); it was over-boiled pork belly (some pieces were tender, but many were hard and tasteless.  And the soft-boiled egg, although tasty, was too tiny to be worth the $2 up charge.  \n\nI wish I had spent my $15 elsewhere.  Like buying lots of pastries at Au Bon Paine.\n\nBut the staff was appropriately attentive, though they didn't seem to understand what \"warm water\" is."

I'm not sure why chicken teriyaki took 20 minutes when there were less then 10 people in line, most of which got their food before me.  The food comes in very small containers packed in so tight you're forced to eat it in layers. All the chicken first, then the lettuce layer, then the rice. Was more frustrating than anything else. One and done for me."

I had the \"pork ramen here, and it's pretty much what one might expect from airport ramen: okay noodles, meh soup (NOT pork!), and hard, kind of dry pork. The pork is actually slightly sour which is a bit concerning, but it's cooked so I'll probably be fine? \n\nI reduced this from a meh three stars to one star because the menu clearly shows a photo of ramen with half an egg for $13 (that's a lot for crappy ramen!), but the egg is actually an extra $2 -- not mentioned anywhere on the menu. That is not okay.\n\nI wonder if it costs extra to have fish included in the sushi.\n\nOh, and I found a pretty big piece of chicken in my pork ramen."

I got the salmon bento box and my gf got the veggie ramen with egg.  I'm sorry we didn't take pics.  We gobbled it up too fast!  It was better than what full, large restaurants serve.

They have cold sake, that is as close to quality as an airport Lounge gets. The green tea Mochi is pretty special. A big thank you for satisfying my foodie needs! Everyone I interacted with here was lonely kind and warm. Highly recommended on a stop over at the philosophy airport."

Again, I have to emphasize that I was shocked I was eating sushi in an airport.  This place has quick bites to go for those that do not have the time to spend.  For those who have a moment to grab some eats, it's worth it!\nI sat at the sushi bar area, which was pleasant and clean, and shared some cozy space with some other travelers that were passing through.  I ordered the green tea (iced) and a Bento box - Salmon.  It was surprisingly fresh and tasted incredible.  Good deal for the amount of food in the meal.  In fact, a passerby saw me eating it and stopped to order the same.  He too was surprised at the quality of sushi given the location in an airport terminal.  Again, they have a great selection of sushi, noodle and rice bowls, bento box options and quick bites to go!\nI definitely recommend this tiny hole in the wall for its excellent staff, service, cozy ambiance and stellar food!"

Not even closeeee\n\nServers are nice, but the tonkatsu broth with pork ramen is a NO.  I struggled to eat it. Because it smelled like fart.  I think it came mostly from the bamboo shoots. And I wasn't sure what the white flecks floating in it were. Noodles were overcooked and strange. Egg costs $2 extra. Mushroom is chewy brown, maybe bellas? I found that to be an odd choice.\n\nMy stomach feels very unsettled right now.  I hope it's all in my head."

The chicken and rice bowl was pretty basic but hit the spot... white sticky rice and some grilled chicken with a little sauce. They were already prepared in a heated cabinet so there was no wait.

When I came here, I got the volcano roll and the miso soup with crab stix. I absolutely love spicy mayo and it was drizzled all over this volcano roll just the right amount. The taste reminded me of my favorite sushi back home! I was also pleasantly surprised by the portion size for how much it was. I've been to other sushi places at airports that charge around the same for very small rolls of 6 pieces. The most unique item was definitely the miso soup with crab stix added (Make sure you ask for it). Most restaurants serving miso soup always give you that generic miso paste mixed with water and only three to four pieces of tofu and nori thrown in. If you go to Japanese restaurants often, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. The miso soup at Gachi, however, cannot even be compared to any other miso soup. The serving size was great and I literally could not get enough of the flavor and all the ingredients inside (I ordered this twice because it was just that good!!). Overall, the food experience was amazing - and the staff were super friendly too! 10/10 would recommend."
