Am amazing place for sushi in the city. We were there for what they were calling their soft opening, where apparently they are testing out menu and cocktail items for their \"official\" opening sometime soon. We were very pleased with the ambiance, service and food/drink. The fish is top quality. We said hello to the owner/executive chef and he seemed to be beaming over his accomplishments, rightfully so! This is a must stop if you're a sushi/Asian fusion fan. We look forward to seeing what's in store for Tuna Bar and are thrilled to have this a two minute walk away!"

The last last few times I have had to wait from 10 to 15 minutes as the team scrambles around trying to find change. All I wanted to do is pay for my food and take it home.   And tonight after the wait for change. I gave them 2 20's for a 27 dollar check. \nI get home and it is the wrong food. My warm dish was cold and my sushi was wrong.  Lost me as a customer"

We started with some basics of edamame and tuna tartare, the tartar took me back to California, the taste of fresh ocean and soft creamy avocado was just to die for. Then we had some creamy rock shrimp that had a tiny bit of spice at the end which was pretty good too. We also had the Miso soup which was one of the best miso soups we've had. This was followed by our version of surf and turf where we had sushi rolls and their steak. We were nothing but satisfied with all of the flavor profiles we were able to enjoy during this entire meal. If you get a chance please check this place out they also have amazing cocktails."

        "text": "Tuna Bar is a new sushi digs in Old City, a relatively upscale neighborhood in a city flooded with mediocre sushi restaurants. I frequent laban's favorites, bubblefish being one of them and the last visit left something to be desired. The fork in the road left me with two options, Royal Izakaya or Tuna Bar, and boy am I glad I chose the latter.\n\nThe ambiance is on point, and the service is friendly and welcoming. The menu is curated beautifully, from my understanding they narrowed it down quite a bit from the other location. This means everything on the menu is guaranteed to be fantastic and FRESH.\n\nWe started with the steamed chicken dumplings which were light and steamed to perfection. The ginger salad followed with slices of avocado and wonderfully balanced ginger dressing that wasn't too sweet. And they even do spring mix, which was great considering romaine isn't the best these days. \n\nFor our sushi selections we went with the classic dragon roll, the east roll, the j & j roll, and 4 pieces of the tasmanian salmon, which is a fattier cut of wild caught alaskan salmon. The fish absolutely melted in your mouth and highlighted the night beautifully. The dragon roll was crafted wonderfully and the rice on every selection seemed to highlight the delicate subtleties of genuinely fresh fish. The wasabi was even a notch above. I don't know what else I can say besides try it for yourself. The preparation of everything was so wonderfully thought out and you can tell they care about what they do here. Ken was also present and very humble about my compliments.\n\n6/5"

The space is really neat. It has an inviting, laid back, retro atmosphere. I felt like I spent the first few minutes just taking in the scenery. They did an excellent job with the decor. We were seated immediately and our server promptly offered us water and drink menus. She was awesome! We ordered edamame and the chicken/shrimp dumplings. Both were very good. We ordered 6 rolls (each came with at least 8 pieces regardless of it being a special or house roll). We got 2 spicy salmon, yellowtail scallion, spider, dragon and the Old City. They were all VERY good. Highly recommend. Even the platters that the food was served on were well thought through. A manager came over to our table to ask us how our experience was. I appreciated that touch and will definitely recommend Tuna Bar to people!"

So I went there on a Friday night with a friend of mine. \n\nAt 7:30pm, It was very crowed, fortunately we made a reservation. We were seated quickly by the window. The server was friendly and nice. Each of use ordered a drink. I ordered Lychee - it's a $15 cocktail. The drink was plain and I could barely taste alcohol. For the price I pay, I would expect a fantastic cocktail. Who wouldn't? \n\nThen it comes to the sushi. We actually also ordered a fried rice. It's very average fried rice, like the ones you can get in Chinatown for $8. But you pay double of the price in this \"fancy\" restaurant. The sushi was ok. Just ok. I'm a sushi lover, and I've tried many sushi restaurants, good and bad. The sushi we had was just average. Didn't blow my mind at all.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is over priced for the food, but I must give credit to its ambience, very modern and romantic. They also have outdoor seating. It's a good restaurant for a date night, but don't expect good food."

The waiter had to come back without us even asking and said I'm so sorry the toro was not up to our standards we're taking it off the bill. We then ordered another roll to supplement which was fine.

The tuna tartar had potential, but needed some finishing salt and maybe a little heat and/or crunch to make it more interesting. \n\nOrdered three rolls and they were awful.  The spicy tuna and the unagi rolls contained this weird mixture, which I assume was pureed fish.  I've never experienced that before.  The salmon rolls had too much rice and the seaweed was too thick.  We slathered the rolls in soy sauce and wasabi to make them more palatable. \n\nOrdered three pieces of sushi.  They were some of the largest pieces of sushi I've ever had. The salmon was not fresh.  The hamachi was boring.  The striped bass, which was the cheapest of the sushis, was actually the most flavorful. \n\nA crisp Riesling is usually a good accompaniment to sushi.  Unfortunately, there is not one on the menu.  The one they had was cloyingly sweet, with no acid or fruit.  It wasn't even finished!  The pinot noir was too earthy.  The cava, while not great, was the best of the options. \n\nThe main restaurant can be very loud.  The small side booths for two are a good option for a couple who want to be able to converse."

With the wall facing the street being all windows, the inside was flooded with natural light. They had a quite large sushi and bar counter in the middle, with seating all around it. They also had small two-person booth seating on the side as well. Very clean decor, I am glad they didn't put up any kind of cheap or fake Asian \"artworks\" on the wall.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer and side dish to go with our sushi rolls. We chose Creamy Rock Shrimp, Lobster Fried Rice, Sindy Roll and Old City Roll. All in all, they were all very tasty, high quality and we enjoyed them very much. Yes, everything was perfect until we ordered some desserts... \n\nSince they didn't have a dessert menu, we ordered Tree Cake and Green Tea Cheesecake based on the description of the dessert that our waitress gave us. \n\nThis so-called Tree Cake...I call it \"rip-off\" cake. Our waitress described it as a cake made with almond, egg and butter. When it came out, I was shocked what it really was... If you are familiar with a common and popular sweets in Japan, one of them is called Baumkuchen which is actually a German layered cake. They can be purchased from most bakeries and stores, and not so pricey unless you go to some fancy boutique to get it. The cake we were presented with, in my opinion, was store-bought, and sliced as thinly as possible. For $10, you can buy an entire cake!!! Very disappointing... And on top of that, it was dry (with these thin slices being cut off from the cake, I wonder how long it has been since the cake was first purchased?). And if that is not enough, we were given spoons to eat this...why? I don't know...\n\nOur waitress was very friendly and polite, and we were well taken care of. Everything we had, other than the Tree Cake was great. High quality and tasty, a bit on pricey side, but that comes with the quality. I wish if we made a different choice with the dessert. But then, you live and you learn. If you go there, avoid the tree cake!"

Atmosphere was lovely and our service was mostly excellent.\n\nWok Kampachi Ceviche app: Delicious! Sweet, savory, umami yumminess.\nTuna tartare app: This was the only dish that I would not order again. The tuna was super fresh but it came too cold and bland. If you are hoping for something akin to the tuna tartare at Morimoto's, this is not it.\nLychee martini- The first one I had was very sweet without enough tang. The second one was better. I would order again. I would suggest that the bar get some fresh lychee to garnish the drink in the future. My first came with flower petals, my second came with a dried orange slice.\n\nRolls:\nSindy: Excellent! Favorite roll of the night. I had never had a roll without rice before and I'm a convert. Everything was fresh and presented just right. No weird temperature issues with the crispy eel. I'm coming back to this place because of this roll.\nDynamite White Tuna - Best spicy tuna I've had.\nDragon roll - this is a standard sushi offering. Getting it here will make you happy. Quality ingredients, perfect combo.\nPeppered tuna - the most understated of the rolls we had. Kind of like a tuna salad flavor. I liked the daikon. You might want to start instead of end with this roll. It did not wow me after the others I had with the bold flavors.\n\nSmall issue- No soy sauce on our table so we had to grab one from a neighboring table.\n\nWe'll be back for the Sindy!"

They also have a bar and I would recommend their cocktails (Geisha). As a party of 3 and we basically ordered 3 appetizers and 3 rolls, and it was definitely filling. The rolls came on one tray for us so we ate it family-styled. However, I saw tables where people had their own plates of sushi as well. \n\nI thought the brussel sprouts were really good, it had an asian style to it, probably from the sesame oil/seeds. The tuna tatare was served over a crispy thin cracker, which balanced out the creamy avocado and tuna. The mai fried rice was decent, just fried rice.\n\nFor rolls, we ordered the peppered tuna, white tuna, and J&J. Though the specialty roll (J&J) was almost double the price of the regular roll, there was definitely more going on and it was a lot more filling. I'd recommend getting at least one specialty roll. Still, the normal rolls such as the peppered tuna was refreshing to eat.\n\nI also noticed that they have pretty exclusive sushi such as uni, el toro, kobe, and live clams."

The place wasn't very crowded and there seemed to be an abundance of servers, but we sat waiting at the table for about 15 minutes before the waitress even came to fill our water. We ordered right away and the food came out relatively quickly, but nothing really wowed me. We started with the fried brussel sprouts which were tasty but not as good as ones I've had elsewhere (I'm looking at you, Sampan). I had miso soup which was fine but served in a large bowl and filled not even a quarter of the way. Definitely not worth the $6. We shared the lobster fried rice which was okay- not an abundance of lobster and a consistency that made it very difficult to eat with chopsticks. Finally we got 3 sushi rolls (2 house rolls and a special roll). They were tasty but not spectacular and had a tendency to fall apart easily. I did appreciate the presentation of the rolls served on a large wooden platter. All together our bill was $70 (no drinks) which was definitely not worth it for what we received. Overall it was overpriced and nothing special. I will say the ambiance was nice however the music was a bit too loud. I probably will not be going back."

The problem is the pricing.  Our main entre was the \"Large\" Sushi Sampler for $60, and a Geisha roll for about $15.  Let's just say we expected a LOT more sushi for that price.  There were literally 7 pieces of sushi and a very small tuna roll on that \"Large\" sampler.  Simply not worth it."

I absolutely love sushi, but when you add an awesome location, fabulous and trendy decor, reasonable prices and outstanding service, you've got a GEM!!! Ok so my sister and i decided to have a sushi lunch date and I'd been hearing about this place and how amazing the ambience and sushi was, not to mention I follow this IG page and the pictorial post are always so mouth watering. Anyway, once we stepped into the restaurant I was immediately impressed and knew we were in for a treat, once we were seated and began glancing over the menu, my mouth began salivating immediately! OMG!!! The options are endless and my inner greedy girl wanted to order EVERYTHING off the menu! We however opted for the brussel sprouts, fried oysters and the tuna tartare as our appetizers, all were to die for delicious! We chose a few sushi roll options to split and as stuffed as i was that inner greedy girl savored every single bite, till it was all gone!!! I could really eat here EVERY day! The sushi is so fresh and good! I can honestly say, the best I've had! What an absolute GEM!

I lived in California for a long time and the sushi there was on another level and I've really struggled to find a place in the Philadelphia area that can compare. We live about an hour outside of the city, but we heard about Tuna Bar and had to come check it out. I'm glad we did, this is the best sushi I've had in a very long time and I couldn't be more impressed. The owner, Ken, came to our table and introduced himself and made recommendations for what to try on the menu. We ended up ordering several appetizers and then a ton of sushi to share and it was fabulous. I'm usually just stick with sashimi and sushi, and skip the rolls, and I finally found a place with excellent fish that doesn't need to be drizzled in spicy mayo or eel sauce to taste good.

One of our guests doesn't drink and the bartender prepared her a delicious alcohol-free mixed drink upon request.

Yesterday was my first night at Tuna Bar and I can't wait to go back. \n\nWe had made reservations in advance and were seated in what I think is the best table of the restaurant - a small table just for two by the window/glass doors. The weather was nice so they had their sliding doors open in which you could feel the breeze and the environment from the outside but also feel like you were part of the upscale dining environment in doors. From either end of the table you got views from the restaurant and from the outside which I thought was magnificent. \n\nThe restaurant per say is beautiful, it has very chic. modern and elegant decor. They have leather booths and small tables and a nice design throughout the restaurant. The music is audible but not extremely loud that disrupts your conversation. \n\nThe service was also very good and our waitress was very pleasant. \n\nAs for the meal everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. We tried the shishito peppers which were perfectly seasoned and the fried Brussels sprouts which were also perfectly crunchy. For our main course we ordered both the Fishtown and Old City sushis and they were SO SO GOOD I'm still dreaming about them. The desserts were also good but not mind blowing (this was the only ok part of our meal). We tried both the Green Tea and the Tree Cake and they were traditional Japanese Sponge Cake which was very good but not exactly what we were expecting as our dessert. \n\nOur glasses of wine and proseco were also very good - I just wish they offered half bottles at a more convenient price. \n\nBottom line is, If you are in old city and looking for a place to dine don't think about it twice."

We were all really impressed with the decor and atmosphere of the restaurant (even if we did get blasted with cold air every time someone new entered).\n\nWe started with the pork gyoza and fried oysters. When we asked our server how many oysters came in an order, she said 2 per order. We ordered two so that all of us could try an oyster. When the plates came out, there were three gigantic oysters on each of them. So, we really didn't need to order 2 at all. The oysters were OK, nothing special. They mostly tasted like breading. The gyoza were disappointing. They really didn't have much flavor and tasted basically like plain ol' pork sausage.\n\nThe actual sushi itself was really good, though. I got some salmon sushi, a yellowtail and chive roll with scallion oil, and a spicy tuna roll. I loved the sushi - it was so tender and melted in your mouth. I also can't say enough good things about the yellowtail/chive/scallion roll. It was...really unique and delicious. I would definitely order that again and advise that you try it for yourself!\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here.

Tuna Bar may be the cities second best option in terms of the variety of fish offered and quality.\n\nNice modern restaurant in Old City located on the main floor of a condo building. Service was excellent on both my visits. You can take your time and enjoy the meal, have a drink or two. Nice laid back atmosphere.\n\nA few appetizers stood out for me - Wagyu beef spring roles, Seaweed salad, Sashimi salad and I loved the Grandmom's wonton soup.  \n\nThe Tuna Bar is at its best serving fresh sushi / sashimi.  I was with larger groups so got to try many of the house rolls which were mostly good but I was happiest ordering from the Sushi A La-Carte section of the menu. The fish was incredibly fresh and not the same boring pieces (i.e. Salman, Tuna, Ebi etc....) served at the 100+ sushi restaurants in Philadelphia.   \n\nLoved the variety of fatty tuna options (Toro and Otoro but no Chutoro when I was there - different options available depending on the day), 1-2 Uni choices, Maguro, Kampachi, Striped Bass, Hamachi and Unagi.  \n\nIf you want above average sushi options / quality, give the Tuna Bar a try. Prices are above average but to be expected given the variety and quality. \n\nRecommended\n\nBK"

Now we're no Japanese cuisine experts but my boyfriend said that was the best wonton soup he's ever had. The soba noodles were very flavorful and tender and all of the rolls were to die for.

Something we had never seen before. \n\nMy boyfriend had only casually mentioned it was my birthday in front of the host but the host was keen enough to pick up on that so the chef made us a small raw fish appetizer that was to die for and since we hadn't saved room for dessert our server, Dori, brought us over two small dessert drinks before we left.

After making the reservation and realizing we weren't able to preview the prix fixe menu, I decided to contact the restaurant since my boyfriend has a shellfish allergy and this can often be a problem with sushi. I called, no answer. So I messaged them via Facebook. I explained his allergy and asked if this would be issue with the menu and their exact response was \"...confirmed with management and there will be no shellfish on tonight's menu...\" (See pic) \n\nGreat, so we went. As soon as we sat down and looked at the menu we realized almost half of it included shrimp aka SHELLFISH (see V-day menu pic). Now maybe they were unaware that shrimp is shellfish? Or maybe they were just too lazy to actually check when I inquired, but either way, it's pretty inexcusable to ignore someone's food allergies and risk a health scare. What if we had asked if a dish included shellfish and my boyfriend had eaten it due to their ignorance? We would have ended up at the hospital. \n\nI'm giving three stars because our waiter did his best to accommodate us once we were already seated and expecting a decent meal. The sushi roll  that he subbed for the 6th course (didn't have a name, his creation) was pretty quality and we did really enjoy it.

The wantons are not in soup, they are just in hot water. It's not even salty hot water it's literally just water.

Deceptive to list lower price if you can charge a higher one and secondly, who the heck serves 1.5 ounces of liquor?  I have lived on the east coast for years and know the average pour is 2 ounces.

I am always on the hunt for good sushi in philly and almost every place I've been to left something to be desired.Tuna bar served fresh sushi and well seasoned soba noodles that not only satisfied but had my friends raving about their next return. You know it's a good meal when we are talking about our next visit!\nSince we had a 5pm reservation we were able to partake in their happy hour specials which included drinks and $5-$7 sushi rolls. It was a great deal considering the quality and ambience. For the sushi we went with the classics spicy tuna, spicy salmon and the salmon avocados. They were able to accommodate for my friend's wheat allergy but giving her gluten free soy sauce. The waiter was very patient and thorough with making sure my friend did not encounter any wheat products. Besides our sushi, my other friend got the chicken dumplings and the avocado ginger salad, which were both excellent. We also happened to come on a particularly beautiful day so the doors were open and they had a photographer take pictures of their new menu items. One of which is this stunning cocktail called 1912 which is inspired by the cherry blossoms in DC. The bartender sprinkled hibiscus dust on top and garnished it with beautiful flowers. It was light and refreshing and not too sweet. It also doesn't hurt that it is a beautiful work of art!\nLastly we had our sweet ending with the dark chocolate sesame ice cream. The chocolate was overpowering the sesame to be honest, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. My only qualm was that the bowl and plates are a bit uneven so it's not ideal for serving. Otherwise, this is a must try!"

We went in to check it out last night and we were not disappointed. Everything was amazing! The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is really beautiful, modern and chic but still comfortable and the food is out of this world. I mean, seriously. We've been to tons of other sushi places in the city and this was the best of the best. We had a bunch of sashimi, scallops, fried oysters (omg, so good), fried lobster rice and rock shrimp. The scallops were my husbands fave, I really loved the oysters and the rock shrimp. Everything was so fresh and so full of flavor. The sashimi was so fresh and \"melt-in-your-mouth\" that it sort of seemed insulting to put soy sauce anywhere near it.  We also had really great cocktails, I highly recommend trying the gin-cucumber-wasabi drink. (I can't remember what it's called, maybe Winston Heat? Wilson Heat? Something like that) I really can't wait to go back to this place, it's so perfect for date night."

However, this was the turning point in our dining experience. We ordered the Fried Oysters, J&J Roll, and 2 sets of the Large Omakase Sushi set. During our ordering process, we had asked the server how many pieces of sushi come in the small and the large sets for the omakase and they responded with 5 and 10 pieces respectively.\n\nThe fried oysters we received came with very little sauce and when we bit into it there was a squirt of seawater and kind of fishy taste to it.\n\nThe J&J roll was well seasoned and each roll had a good balance of flavors and sauce. However, when you eat the fish laying on top, there was almost no flavor and almost had a hard texture to it. Something one wouldnt expect when eating raw fish.\n\nThe omakase came out with 8 pieces instead of 10 pieces as stated previously. The excuse we received was because we got to eat Otoro (fatty tuna). There was also no explanation of each piece nor sauce that we received. The sushi itself was something that you would expect out of a supermarket sushi bar, premade and refrigerated.\n\nOverall, for the price paid compared to the quality of service and food that you receive, I would not recommend this restaurant. I would give the Tuna Bar a 2/5."

We went on a Sunday because we were able to get childcare and we decided on a late dinner because it was easier for similar reasons. Per the website Tuna Bar closes at 10pm on Sunday and we got there around 8:30pm which should have been plenty of time to enjoy a meal. \n\nBy 8:50pm it was clear the staff was ready to wrap up, soy sauce was  collected from the tables around us and we felt rushed. At 9:15pm a staff member loudly swept around our table where we were mid-meal. Frankly this was gross and disruptive. When it was barely 9:30pm chairs were brought in from outside and were stacked near our table. \n\nI will say Diamond was our server and she was great. The food was also good but was not easily enjoyed due to the other aspects of our experience. \n\nI actually both called Tuna bar and emailed to discuss our experience and received no contact back.

        "text": "We heard about Tuna Bar when watching the news one night. They do sushi making classes, we definitely have to check it out! We took the train down and walked a few blocks to reach the restaurant. We arrived before our reservation but were seated right away. We had a window view which made it great for people watching, but it definitely would be better in warmer weather because the windows seem like they could turn the restaurant into an open-air concept.\nWhat we ordered: \n\nChicken and shrimp dumplings: Long chives, ginger, crispy chicken skin, steamed. Just your average dumpling. Nothing too unique about it, but they were tasty nonetheless.\n\nWagyu Beef Spring rolls: onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, and mustard sauce. The mustard sauce was a star of this dish.  I could honestly drink it. It went really well with the spring rolls but made the dumplings much better. We honestly wanted to order like 6 more servings of these. SO GOOD.\n\nEel Avocado Roll A perfect balance of eel to avocado. It had a teriyaki-ish sauce on top.\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll  Just your normal spicy tuna roll, but it's my go-to. I definitely didn't need to eat any more sushi at this point in the meal, but I love trying them wherever I go. \n\nDragon Roll: crab, avocado, cucumber, topped with fried eel and avocados. \n\nDynamite White Tuna Roll: spicy walu, crunch, and shishitos.\n\nThey weren't kidding about the spice of this roll. The spice was at a good level between the spicy sauce and shishitos and the tuna seemed to balance it all out. Would definitely order this again.\n\n KJ Roll: seared scallops, Kani, cucumber, avocado, and wasabi aioli\n\nAlso delicious. Just the right about of heat and had a great amount of seafood in the roll\n\nRolls that weren't our favorite: \n\nBroad Street Roll: spicy salmon, avocado, crunch, soy paper, topped with king salmon and spicy salmon. No rice. \n\nThis was the roll that our server recommended. although it was good, it was probably my least favorite roll that we ordered. I'm not sure if I ever had a roll without rice, but it felt like it was missing something texturally. If you like salmon, you should order it, but it was just meh to me.\n\nOverall, we liked the Tuna Bar. The food and service were good, but the atmosphere was a bit loud for our liking. I think I saw that they have happy hour deals, but I know we definitely missed it by going on a Saturday night. I think the prices were reasonable for an upscale sushi joint. The drinks were a bit pricy, so we just had a drink (a Sapporo for him and Prosecco for me)."

California, California with real crab made crispy, cucumber roll, peanut avocado (the kids' favorite!), seaweed salad, edamame, and incredible Brussels! Must order!

It will be be on my radar for the next First Friday or after a movie at The Ritz!\n\nI actually found it a tad difficult to spot from the street. It's the door just to the left of United Blue.

I am a sushi snob having lived in NYC and Singapore for years, and this is the only place I've been to in Philly that remotely compares aside from Morimoto and Tomo. Their tuna is very fresh and high quality, the salmon and yellowtail are always very good and fresh too. They do a spicy tuna roll 'the right way' with little mayo and big pieces of sushi, as opposed to the mushy, orange paste-y consistency of most spicy tuna rolls I've had in Philly. The lobster fried rice is also very good with a fresh flavor but a little light on the lobster. I haven't tried anything else as of yet.\n\nWhat sets this place apart is their happy hour and daily specials - you can't beat it anywhere in The City! Salmon avocado, spicy salmon, or spicy tuna toll for $5! You can also choose from chicken and shrimp gyozas and a couple other items for $5. Drinks specials are $5 for the cocktail special and about $4 for beer and wine. Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday where you can get tuna tartare for $7, and Wednesday is hand rolls for $5. \n\nThe service is definitely one of my favorite things about this place. The bartenders are friendly and prompt and super professional. The atmosphere is really cool, a mix of rustic with an Old City feel. They've been open for a year, but I wish I'd found them sooner!"

Both the gyoza and sushi were the best I've had in Philadelphia for sure. The Omakase nigiri was absolutely phenomenal, every piece was perfectly formed and just delicious. Real sushi chefs behind the counter. Gyoza was flavorful, pan seared just right as well. \n\nService was good, albeit a *tiny* bit slow but we were also there an hour before closing on a Friday night when there are tons of people there at the bar and sitting outside -- our waiter was doing the best he could.

We got the lychee (vodka, lychee, lemongrass, and sake) and the winstons heat (gin, wasabi, lemon and cucumber). Both were super refreshing. \n\nFor the appetizers we got the creamy rock shrimp and the brussel sprouts. The shrimp portion was small but these two were probably my favorite of the night.

We managed to squeeze in early as it as a weekday after the rain and no one was exactly out. I highly recommend reservations here as they are literally always booked and it was my cousins 3rd try. Their sushi is extremely fresh and they do have very unique takes on rolls compared to what I have seen in the area. Our waitress extremely patient and kind. The decor is beautiful but of course its dim and romantic so you can't really see what you're eating either. Seating is small and parking is of course limited.\n\nEverything about the place is insta-ambiance worthy and picture perfect but I can't help but feel it was a little over-hyped. We got the Tuna Crudo which was delicious (aka tuna carpaccio as a comparison fyi) as an appetizer. As for the rolls, the only memorable one that is all over yelp and pictured everywhere is the broad street roll which is that salmon roll you see with the beautiful filters. I thought it was unique in that it had no rice and the fish was fresh but other than that I am not sure what I was expecting.

I'm so glad we did because it was the highlight of our trip! \n\nThis may be a bold statement, but Tuna Bar is the best sushi I've ever had (and I've tried a LOT of sushi). \n\nEven the atmosphere is so interesting. The lights and decor are clean and aesthetically pleasing. The hostess seated us immediately at our reservation time and handed us menus, as well as a drink menu. \n\nTo start, we ordered Sapporo beers, a Geisha (green tea, soju, sparkling white wine, green tea flakes), and a See You Later cocktail (which had rose petals on top). I had the Geisha, and it was a great pairing with the sushi- very light but flavorful. \n\nFor our appetizers, we split a tuna curdo (my favorite dish), tuna tartare, edamame, and a seared tuna salad. Everything was amazing and flavorful. The tuna was the best fish I've ever tasted. \n\nThe owner of the restaurant brought us complimentary shishito peppers, as well. They're simple but delicious! I'm actually craving them now. \n\nFor the rolls and sashimi, we ordered a variety- old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna roll, maguro sashimi, and a peanut avocado roll. I attached pictures of the menu that explains what's inside each. \n\nThe maguro sashimi was my favorite. It's just a piece of fish, but it was so tender and flavorful. Even the wasabi that I put on the fish was unique! Much different than the generic, gooey wasabi from every other sushi restaurant I've tried. \n\nI absolutely LOVE Tuna Bar- I wish they had one in New York, but that just means I'll have to visit Philly soon!"

I'll admit to being a creature of habit, so no one that knows me would be surprised that tonight, absent the prodding of my wife or friends, I ordered items that I had before.  \n\nI started with Grandmom's Wonton Soup because I needed something soothing.  I believe I tasted a very slight hint of vinegar in the broth.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but whatever it is, it provides a modern flare to the broth, to go along with the delicate and very tasty deconstructed wontons.  The dough used for the wontons is extremely light, and the sausage is more significant with great flavor.  My second course, the Wok Kampachi Ceviche, was not only as delicious as before, but this time the kampachi was a more generous serving than my earlier experience.  \n\nRather than a number of smaller dishes, tonight for my third course, I decided to order a larger entree.  The Salmon Shokiyaki proved to be just the right choice.  I like my cooked salmon to have a warm pink center, yet a slight crispness on the outside.  This dish was perfectly done with a warm pink center, slightly crisp, along with a glaze on it that I think may have been miso based.  I'm not sure about the glaze, but it doesn't matter because I'd order it again anyway.  \n\nBetween the food and a sampling of a few sake's, it was a great way to spend my free time.  At this restaurant, the only other thing I really wished they served might be an assortment of robatayaki.  Are you listening Ken?"

Here are the issues, the winston's heat could have been more strain for a cocktail. While I love cucumber, there were way too many bits in the cocktail (see photo). The service was subpar. The waiter explain that he had \"forgotten\" about our salad order after nearly 35 minutes of waiting. My part visited during lunch and there must not have been more 10 people attending during our time. Ironically the salad was the best part of the meal. The ginger dressing was delish but maybe a bit over dressed. I found the rolls to be entirely too fishy and not too flavorful. Also call me skeptic, but I don't like the boxes that the sushi is served in. The little wooden rates and obviously hard to clear because we could see debris under our rolls. That is inexcusable especially during a time for a heightened need for cleaning. I was hoping this would be a new sushi gem in philly but it was just underwhelming."

        "text": "Hip, mid-century modern decorated sushi spot with some hits and some misses but overall a good time. \n\nCame with a party of 7 to celebrate my mom and aunt's birthday. We opted not to bring a cake because they have a $45 cake fee. \n\nThe drinks here were strong and I quite enjoyed them. I tried the Winston's heat, which was very much cucumber-y and refreshing, the NORI-Grets, which basically tasted like a margarita, and the Yuzu sour, which was a bit too sour for me. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes for the table, which came to around $400 with tip and tax. \n\nThings I'd recommend:\n1. UNI: the uni here was surprisingly fresh (compared to a lot of their other fish). While MP was $12 a piece, I'd say it was pretty worth it. Not sure if the UNI is always this fresh, but we definitely came on a good day. \n\n2. Vegetable fried rice: I'm sure all the fried rices here are good (they have 3 different choices in total, a sausage one, a crab wasabi one, and a veggie one): We opted for the veggie rice and it was delicious - Super simple, but full of flavor. A bit greasy, but definitely a delicious and straightforward dish. \n\n3. Grandma's Wonton soup: I didn't try this, but this was a dish ordered for my grandmother (we thought a grandma soup would be good for a grandma lol). She really enjoyed this! These are Fuzhou style wontons so they're super small, but she ate this entire dish and that doesn't happen often - so they must've been authentic and delicious! \n\nThings I thought that were just OKAY: \n1. The rolls: We ordered the eel avocado, California, avocado, and peanut avocado roll (lots of avocado lol). While they were pretty solid (was personally not a big fan of the peanut avocado roll), I'd say it really wasn't anything special. I guess they presented it in an aesthetic way, but definitely not any better than the regular $5 lunch special rolls at a random sushi joint. If you're a fan of sushi rolls, their rolls are definitely a safe option to order but again, they won't wow you. \n\n2. Oysters: My mom actually really enjoyed the oysters, so this might be a preference thing. They weren't bad by any means but I definitely didn't like that the oysters were pre-seasoned and flavored. Whenever places do that it naturally makes me question the oyster freshness. We ordered 12 oysters in total, 6 East coast and 6 west coast. The oysters were around $3, which I thought was pretty pricey - especially because dollar oysters are pretty easy to find. I pay for $3 in NYC when I've missed happy hour and am REALLLLLLLY craving oysters, otherwise I can't really justify the price - especially in Philadelphia and for the size/taste of these oysters. Again, not bad but not worth it in my book. \n\n3. Seaweed salad: We ordered this for my grandmother who's pretty picky with what she eats. It tasted like standard seaweed salad. Not really sure what else to say about this one. \n\nThings I'd skip: \n1. Tuna tartare: My cousin mentioned this was a dish that was pretty popular here so we decided to try it. Tuna didn't taste very fresh. \n\n2. Big tuna sashimi: Tuna, again, didn't taste fresh. I'm confused why this place is called tuna bar when their tuna doesn't seem...great. Our waiter described this as an \"omakase\" but we chose to order and share with the table. The best part of this plate was the tuna rolls. The sashimi slices were fishy and honestly the color of the fatty tuna made me feel, for lack of better words, A BIT FISHY, about this place. \n\nOVERALL, this place is a fun time and has a great atmosphere. Their fish and tuna truly is...whatever, but I'd still recommend this spot for a nice date or hangout with friends / family."

Instead of being understanding, the manager was SO RUDE and defensive; making up excuses, etc. It was baffling... Figure it out and refill the bathroom with toilet paper ??? Anyways.

Overall, given the higher quality, I don't mind that too much. The atmosphere and service are both pretty nice, with a pretty neat space that is decorated nicely. Servers were able to answer questions that I posed.\n\nHaven't tried the whole menu yet, but can recommend a few things. Overall, I like the hot entrees a bit better than the sushi and the cooked food is quite good in general (and mostly reasonably priced). Sushi is a bit on the pricey side, but nothing crazy for the quality. Having said that, I think the sushi at Kisso down the street (will review soon) is just as good, if not better. But this is a more fun place to go, so the jury is out...\n\nAppetizers: Tuna Tartare ($14), Creamy Rock Shrimp ($12), Pork Gyoza ($8), Chicken and Shrimp Dumplings ($8), \n\nSoup: Grandmom's Wonton Soup ($7)\n\nSashimi: Toro (fatty tuna-$12), Hamachi (yellowtail-$8)\n\nTraditional Rolls: California ($6), Real California ($9), Spicy Salmon ($7)\n\nHouse Rolls: Peppered Tuna Roll ($9-favorite roll here); Dragon Roll ($12)\n\nSpecial Rolls: Fishtown Roll ($17), Sindy Roll ($16), Old City Roll ($17-very good)\n\nHot Entrees: Salmon Shokiyaki ($23-outstanding), Bone-in Strip Steak ($36-outstanding), Lobster Fried Rice ($16), Mai Fried Rice ($14-outstanding), Stir Fried Soba Noodles ($15)"

        "text": "So there seems to be some a few mixed reviews on this place and I honestly can't see why. It's a beautiful restaurant, the food and service was great and their specials were amazing. The ambience is perfect for a date night. We ordered the brussel sprouts which were nicely charred and doused in sweet and salty sauce, and the tuna tartare which isn't a super unique dish but it was done very well and it came with rice crackers to serve as a vehicle for the tuna. We also went with some happy hour rolls of spicy tuna, salmon avocado which were $5 each then a peanut avocado roll as well for $6. The peanut avocado roll is so simple and so good. I actually ordered a second one I liked it so much. I've had spicy tuna at more places than you can count, and this is exactly what you want when ordering spicy tuna. You can tell a restaurant knows what it's doing by the rice. Tuna bar knows what it's doing. Again, these aren't super original, but just done very well and a bit more refined than your typical fusion restaurant. We finished the meal with some Mochi for dessert that had 3 flavors and they were all delicious.\n\nSince there's a lack of happy hour info on Yelp, here's the down low on their happy hour. This could be the best happy hour deal in the whole city. It's Mon-Fri from 4:30-7. Drink options are: one sake (mine was only $4 and poured traditionally overflowing into a masu box), one house red and one house white wine for $7. We went with the white and it was pretty good. You have the options of 3 beers, Kirin, Kirin Lite, and Orion for $5, $4, $4 respectively. Then there's one rotating house cocktail for $7. The night we went, it was a gin martini made with craft vermouth which is a ridiculous deal for just $7. Judging the way they handled the sake alone I'm sure their bar program is excellent. I will return to confirm this.\n\nHappy hour food: 3 rolls for $5 each, Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and Salmon Avocado. There's also chicken and shrimp dumplings for $7, edamame for $4 and shrimp and oysters for $2 a piece. \n\nBonus tip: (as far as I know) every Tuesday is Tuna Tuesday. Spicy tuna rolls are $6 all day and tuna tartare is $7. Every Thursday is Toro Thursday. Negitoro rolls are $7 all day. \n\nJust come try this place for a happy hour, you'll never want to leave."

We ordered the J&J, the Old City (does not come looking like the picture shown on Yelp; it is all flat) and the Fishtown rolls. The Tuna tartare appetizer is delicious though so I would 100% recommend starting with that.

This is FuZhou style - I laughed when I read it on the menu because I am from FuZhou and this is a traditional soup that my grandma would ACTUALLY make for us eat all the time at home, or you could buy it for like less than a dollar in noodle shops. It was funny to see it being served at an upscale place like this for $8 bucks. It was delicious nonetheless and a nice warming appetizer.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of sushi and rolls afterwards and they brought it out all together on a huge wooden tray for us to share (presentation def did not disappoint).

Overall, the fish was fresh and tasty, though I would have liked a little more flavor on some of the specialty rolls.\n\nWe started with: (1) Grandma's Wonton Soup (traditional fuzhou style pork wontons, scallions, celery), which was delightful--a very gentle broth and ghost-like wontons floating therein; (2) Pork Gyoza (kurobuta pork, scallions, ginger, pan-fried), which were nicely crisp, flavorful, and served piping hot; and (3) Wagyu Beef Spring Rolls (onion, ginger, cabbage, scallions, mustard sauce), which included some delicious beef, however, the beef overwhelmed the rest of the spring roll.\n\nWe rolled on with: (a) Yellowtail & Chives house roll (avocado, chive oil), my favorite roll of the evening--that chive oil gave it a certain special something; (b) King Ghidorah specialty maki (spicy tuna, shishitos, hot sesame oil, topped with yellow-tail, jalape\u00f1o, tobiko), my second favorite roll; (c) Dynamite White Tuna house roll (spicy walu, crunch, shishitos), my third favorite roll; (d) Fishtown specialty maki (shrimp tempura, avocado, jalape\u00f1o, topped with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy aioli), although this roll looked like it would have the most flavor, it didn't deliver on its looks, tasty, sure, but not my favorite; and (e) Eel Avocado classic maki.\n\nThe service was stellar and I appreciated the wider-width sidewalk permitting outside dining to be away from the flow of pedestrian traffic.

The food is of excellent quality and presentation, while the restaurant is chic with a New York City vibe. \n\nI actually ate there two nights in a row so that I could get a true taste of the cuisine.  The Wok Kampachi Ceviche was excellent but my favorite was the Scallop Crudo.  You should try Grandmom's Wonton Soup, which is a creative new rendition of the old time favorite that I highly recommend.  I even had my favorite roll, the Sindy roll, which I eat at the Maple Shade location.

It's just difficult to come by, while this sushi was not the best I have ever had, the experience was five stars. \n\nFirst, I love the ambience. This is a place that suits many occasions, first dates, get together with friends, lunch with a coworker, etc. I would say definitely more of an intimate setting, I came here with Megan F. for a lunch during a work break! Such great vibes. Love the bar area and full length windows, just adds to the ambience! \n\nWe tried their steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings as an appetizer and for rolls we split the J&J roll, peppered tuna roll, and the east roll. The east roll is just your standard salmon sushi roll, nothing too crazy.  The J&J is a great roll for people trying to transition into the sushi eating world of actual raw fish! Loved the seared tuna on the outside. Hands down, our favorite was the peppered tuna roll! I'm a spicy tuna roll enthusiast and I decided to switch it up with this roll. I have zero regrets, a definite must try and great chance of tuna palette.\n\n\nOverall the place and the sushi varieties are very modern, definitely worth a try if you're near this area of philly!"

        "text": "Wow... simply speechless. Tuna Bar is hands down the best restaurant for sushi in Philly. \n\n5/5 STARS!\n\nFood: First and foremost, their food is amazing. I have been to many sushi spots in the greater city and Philadelphia area but Tuna Bar's sushi has the best overall quality and taste. Their speciality rolls are to die for. My personal favorites are the Sindy Roll, Rittenhouse Roll, and Hurts Roll. As for favorite appetizers, it is definitely the tuna flatbread and their oysters. Yum. \n \nDrinks and Cocktails: The best part about going to an amazing restaurant for food is having an amazing alcohol and drink selection to complement the meal. Personal favorite cocktails are the yuzu sour and the race street. If you're a sake fan then definitely ask them about their wide variety of sake. Cheers! \n\nAmbience: The ambience and the atmosphere of the restaurant is amazing. The \"vibes\" are great. They are always playing great music that sets a positive mood for everyone. Big ups to whomever created that playlist! \n\nService: Last but certainly not the least, their service. Simply wow. Tuna bar has the best service. I have to give Ken, the owner, a thumbs up for creating such an amazing establishment with an amazing team. Their General Manager, Tina, was phenomenal. Her professionalism, positive attitude, and seasoned experience can be seen from a mile away. I remember on a busy Saturday night, she was juggling 5 things at once, but still managed to provide my family and I an amazing time. She was super friendly! The rest of the staff were A+ too! \n\nWould I go again? YES YES YES. \n\nRecommend to a friend? FOR SURE. \n\nStop reading and book your reservation now."

The rolls are all unique/delicious, and most importantly the quality of the fish is unmatched- where you don't even want to use soy sauce because the taste is so good. I recommend the fishtown and king ghidorah rolls. You really taste the unique touches like shishito and hot sesame oil. Already looking forward to next time. Highly recommend!"

Modern with retro inspired decor, I felt thoroughly welcomed by the warm staff the second I walked through the door. I would definitely recommend making a reservation, especially on a weekend, as the place was pretty packed when my dining companion and I arrived. \n\nThe menu is relatively small, but from our experience, everything was made with thought and care. We started off with cocktails, the tequila for us both. While the smell let us know it was a generous pour, it was easy to drink and not overly sweet. We split 4 rolls in total: Fishtown, peppered tuna, dynamite tuna, and spicy salmon. The presentation was beautiful, and every roll was delicious, although my favorite was the Fishtown. It was clear that all of the fish and other ingredients were fresh! Our meal a bit pricey, which we expected, but worth the splurge for great sushi!\n\nAs others have stated, the service at Tuna Bar was simply outstanding. The owner himself even stopped by before the end of our meal to inquire how we were doing. A lovely dining experience overall!"

I understand that it was the first opening day and some hiccups are to be expected, but Friday is quite beyond.  First we arrived at our reservation time of 7:30.  Once we arrived we were told by the very disheveled matradee that they were running about 30 minutes late.  No issue so we took a walk around the block.  We arrived back at 8 and were told we were the 2nd table to be seated after 1 couple and they were cleaning 2 tables at that moment.  We sat on the bench at which point I watched him seat 2 couples.  Then another customer who showed up later than us went and said something and he sat them at a 4 top.  At that point I went back up and he looked at his computer and couldn't find my name. He eventually found it and looked confused.  He said I'll be the next couple and said here's a $25 gift card.  It was only $15 when I opened at home.  We waited another 15 minutes at which point a waiter started going to everyone including us to tell us they were out of food.  \n\nThere were multiple chances to tell us they would be out.  Instead we waited and waited, watched other people be seated when we were due to be next.  I rather write to you directly then putting my review on social sites as I think you should know about my full experience.  The waiter did give us a $50 gift card as he did with others for running out of food.    I emailed the restaurant direct with no response.  DONE"

Menu has a nice feel with minimalistic approach in design. Overall, the interior design is one of my favorite things about this place.\n\nService - 3/5\n\nHost is friendly and the waiters are nice. Nothing extraordinary. The only thing I thought (and maybe it wasn't appropriate for me to expect?) was that there would be an introduction to the sushi sampler/omakase we ordered. I'm clearly not a sushi expert so I had no idea what I was eating, but I kind of wish I did. I guess I was used to an intro/story typically offered at other sushi places for an omakase.\n\nFood - 3/5\n\nWhat I ordered the few times I've been here:\nRittenhouse Roll, J&J, Omakase/Sushi Sampler & Fried Oysters \n\nThe rolls were great. I enjoyed the Rittenhouse Sq Roll thoroughly and the J&J was good to taste. The fried oysters and sushi samplers weren't my favorite. The fried oysters were too sea watery for my taste, and the sushi samplers didn't feel too fresh to me.\n\nPrice - 2/5\n\nFor the price of the food, I would expect a little more from the food and service itself. The interior design matches what I would expect in pricing. \n\nOverall I would give this place a 3.5 if I could. Thank you for the experience!"

There are small 2 seater \"booths\" that would be cute for dates  as well as large tables that have a mix of a sofa seating as well as chairs. \n\nThey do take opentable reservations! However, when we got there, it wouldn't have been an issue to get a table - but we also went at 8 Pm on a Wednesday:) \n\nStarters:\n\nBlood orange fluke - best part of the meal. The fluke was so gooood and went really well with the capers, blood orange, and radish pieces! I couldn't get enough! A must ORDER!! \n\nRock shrimp: this was good as well!! I liked it because it wasn't coveredddd in sauce or heavily fried. It was the perfect balance of sauce and batter  - there was radish pieces as well - which I loved! Gave it a nice, refreshing crunch to your bite. \n\nLobster rice - this was just your usual fried rice ... with lobster and mushrooms. Some at my table said it was too salty - I think it was the mushrooms - but the rice itself was decent. I'd order it if I wanted fried rice \u200d\n\nSoba noodles with shrimp - this was good too. My pick over the rice, actually. However, we had this after the rock shrimp and fluke - and those seemed to be the best! \n\nSushi: \n\nSushi was decent. But nothing heavenly delicious. I have yet to find a good sushi place in Philly  however, the starters were really good, which would make me want to go back and try the other dishes besides the sushi. Sushi wasn't bad, but it wasn't amazing either. But good place to go to take care of that sushi craving! \n\nThe sushi that we tried....\n\nJ&J : this was the best out of the 3 we got. It tasted fresh and flavorful. It had a bit of a rich taste which made you feel full after 2! \nBroad street: this was okay. Too many ingredients made the sushi feel soggy and the flavors didn't seem to have .... flavor. Just wasn't a good combo, in my opinion.\nDynamite : your typical rollllll- which isn't a bad thing. Smaller than the first two, good to have a traditional roll with your specialities!"

Upon arrival I was glad I had made an Open Table reservation as every table was reserved and the last bar seats had just been swiped. At first glance, you notice the stunning and modern decor. This place is gorgeous! From the wood bar to the cool fans, you get the trendy ambiance that is often missing from sushi spots. \n\nThe bar menu was small but each drink was really interesting. It's clear that they are committed to craft cocktails and keeping an upscale bar. Our waiter also informed us that a lengthy sake menu will be arriving soon.  \n\nThe food was delicious! Started with the rock shrimp. Perfect. Moved on to the lobster fried rice which was extremely flavorful and not at all greasy. Had a few rolls for our main course all of which were extremely fresh and with a good rice to fish ratio. \n\nThe service was friendly, knowledgeable and not at all overwhelmed or (seemingly) stressed considering it was open weekend.

A lot of the special sushi rolls that sounded good were mainly tuna though. I would like to see more choices with another type of fish, but can't complain too much hence the name, Tuna Bar. \n\nAlthough the food was amazing, the service could be better. It took a little longer for our server to come check on us after the food came out. It was later in the evening, so I figured they were busy closing out on a few other tables - fair enough. However, we were then not checked on again for another 30-40 minutes after we were done eating. We all kind of just sat there with empty plates and water glasses wondering if we should ask the hostess to track them down. The restaurant was not busy at all at this point...maybe four tables throughout the whole restaurant (with 3 or so servers working) and a few people at the bar. Nonetheless, we will be back as the location and food outweighs the hit or miss service."

Not to mention it's a good looking restaurant with some pretty cool decor and a great ambiance.\n\nWe started with edemame, tuna tartar, tuna curdo and seared tuna salad. They were all amazing but my favorite was the tuna curdo which is basically thin slices of raw tuna in a delicious sauce. Order this app it's incredible.\n\nMoving on to the rolls... We had the old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna and some yellowtail sashimi. Let me repeat the quality of fish they serve he is the best I have had period. All of these rolls were extremely tasty but my favorite was the peppered tuna! It comes with an amazing wasabi drizzle and the tuna is pepper crusted.\n\nWe also had a few Sapporo beers and the ladies had cocktails the geisha and the I'll see you lata.

The bar is made out of pieces of wood that kinda scream Fixer Upper is on the DVR. The vibe of the place was urban and perfect for its location. For apps we ordered the Roasted Brussel Sprouts. Tuna Crudo, Miso Soup and the Pork Gyoza. \n\nThe Miso was $6 bucks, when I asked my companion was it $6 bucks worthy there was a reply of lacking flavor but the size was equivalent to 2 $3 bowls somewhere else. \nThe Brussel Sprouts: Now I confess I hadn't had brussel sprouts since at least 12 and that pushing it but I decided to step out of my comfort zone and try them roasted instead of boiled and I am now a fan. The sesame oil was perfect and they were charred just enough to elicit the flavor of the sprouts to be slightly sweet.\nTuna Crudo: My companions loved this dish and advised the truffle oil was slightly overwhelming but delectable.\nPork Gyoza: Always good and great with the left over truffle oil\n\nThe perk of sitting at the bar was watching the chefs make the rolls and trying to figure out which one was ours. There is a mirror above the bar and more than once did we find ourselves staring at what was going on. We ordered 4 rolls to share: Fishtown, Old City, J&J and the Real California. The J&J was my favorite the shishito pepper would kick in right at the end for a spicy finish. The Old City looked to be the most popular coming off the bar and it made sense - its a instagramable plate in its own right and has a good flavor combo. I initially ordered the Fishtown and depending on what piece of fish you got on top kinda determined if it worked in my opinion. We decided to try the Real California roll for fun and honestly I could have done without.\n\nOverall I liked it and would try it again. I do wonder if they are going to rotate rolls to keep it fresh."

It's in a great location and it's so modern inside and provides a great atmosphere for a girls night, date night, friend date, family date, etc. etc. etc. Outdoor seating is available. They have the ceiling to floor doors that they open wide during a nice night which gives you the feel of eating outside even when you are dining indoors. It's relatively small inside so I definitely recommend making a reservation if our plan to come at a busy time. \n\nThe service was good. A little slow but we weren't in a rush so it worked for us.\n\nWe came during happy hour and got two spicy tuna rolls and two spicy salmon rolls (which are $5 each at happy hour prices). It took a while for them to come out. I actually thought she forgot about them. They were just ok. \n\nMy friend got the edamame which she enjoyed. I got a ginger salad. It said it had avocado so I assumed they were just trying to be different by calling it a ginger salad instead of an avocado salad. Most sushi restaurants that I go to have an avocado salad on the menu with ginger dressing and it has at least a half of an avocado on top. This salad came out almost immediately after I ordered it and it was super cold which makes me feel like it's one of those restaurants that pre-makes salads and keeps them in a fridge or cooler. The avocado was so sparse I barely even knew it was in there. Not what I'm used to! To be fair, I assumed it was the avocado salad that I get at other sushi restaurants. \n\nWe split the lobster fried rice because so many people raves about it in the reviews. It was decent. Not amazing. It was kind of egg-y; I felt like that was the dominant flavor. \n\nThe other special rolls I ordered are pretty forgettable. One was a KJ, I believe. That's all I really remember. I don't remember what the other one was even called or what was in either of them. What's not forgettable is the price point of these unforgettable rolls. Their special rolls cost $15 to $21 per roll. ($21? Seriously?) They were falling apart as we tried to pick them up with the chopsticks. The wasabi was more mild than I'm used to. \n\nThe bathrooms are individual rooms for one person at a time. There was different music playing in the bathroom and it felt like a dance party. I was jamming out in there. Lol. \n\nThere is kiosk parking located nearby. Just a short walk will get you there. I'm not sure of any lots. \n\nThis place is great for the atmosphere but I've had wayyyyyy better sushi at a way lower price point. I feel like you are paying for the location more than anything. While I loved the ambiance, I don't really know that it would be worth returning to. I have sushi so infrequently that if I'm in the mood for it, I would rather go somewhere with better sushi and maybe not as awesome of an environment than mediocre, overpriced sushi in a modern, breezy location. \n\nThis is a miss for me and I can't really recommend it...unless you really want to pay a lot for mediocre sushi."

Appetizers were extremely small and I think there was four pieces of shrimp and a $12 rock shrimp appetizer, each one barely 2 g in weight.

I was also not impressed with the lack of service. I really had high hopes for this place but it let my partner and I down in two crucial areas: food and service. Needless to say, our check, which was above $100, did not seem to meet what we got.

Cute decor, instagrammable, and great service. \n\nAs soon as I walked in with my company, I was greeted by an amazing host Jack. His personal style is on point and he has most amazing manners. He walked us to our table. \n\nThen, we had phenomenal service from Henry who was our waiter. He made sure my friend was accommodated since she is gluten-free. He answered all of our questions and made great suggestions. \n\nSushi were fresh and delicious! All drinks were strong. I love their fried rice options. \n\nI will definitely be back and this is one of the most romantic places in all of Philadelphia. Great food, great staff, and great atmosphere. What else can you possibly want?"

Staff was friendly and very professional. I ordered the Yuzu sour, which was very refreshing. Easy to drink and not sweet at all. Our table received a complimentary tuna crudo, which was so tasty. The tuna was soaked in the ponzu and truffle oil, which made it extremely flavorful. Very easy to eat! My bf and I ordered the seaweed salad, old city roll and hurts roll. I don't know which roll I prefer, but both were SO good! I loved the crab salad on my sushi roll but the creamy rock shrimp was just as good. I would 100% reorder these two rolls. The other couple ordered the vegetable fried rice and 2 traditional rolls. They are regulars and always eat at Tuna Bar. Highly recommend this spot and will definitely come back!"

Tuna Bar is a beautiful space in Old City, Philadelphia, which features indoor and outdoor seating, delicious food, and creative drinks. It's located down the block from our wedding venue, Power Plant Productions, and we knew it would be a perfect location for an after party. The staff and Tina at Tuna Bar were attentive, friendly, and made us feel special. We were blown away with the setup, signs, and decor they had for our private booking, and loved the entire experience here. We definitely recommend Tuna Bar for a private event!"

But let's talk about Ducky Spots. Duck as in when you can go to a nice spot and dodge the people you normally run into. That's what I took away from the Tuna Bar. It's open enough (outside seating on Race Street!) and dimly lit enough inside that a first or second date here doesn't run the risk of bumping into your whole crew. That's worth something in a city this small. Capable kitchen, friendly staff. Everything is just fine. Now, next up is their happy hour which from the looks of the menu might be the best deal (versus regular priced menu) in Old City. We'll see."

Completely wrong. \n\nServer was somewhat knowledgeable when asking him questions about the food but my boyfriend and I pretty much answered our own questions. \n\nCleanliness- the menus were all paper and it looked very unprofessional due to all the wrinkles and sauce spill. The wine glass were very dusty. The spoon for our fried rice had a hair/fuzzy on it.\n\nFood- Sad to say, the lobster fried rice was the best part of our dinner. The wagyu beef and west coast uni was good and kinda what we expected. The king salmon ($9) and otoro ($16) was such a disappointment. Both did not taste like the fish we wanted. The quality and presentation didn't match up to what we wanted. We eat sushi very often so we know what it look like and should taste like. That was not worth the money at all. We also had the chicken and shrimp dumplings, it was okay, very strong shrimp taste. But wasn't hot when it came out. \n\nPrice- Too expensive for bad quality fish."

The first time, we were very impressed by the quality of the fish and the preparation of our food. The second time, the quality was still very good but it wasn't prepared as well as the first time we visited. Since this restaurant is fairly expensive, we were slightly disappointed. \n\nThe food we ordered included miso soup, tuna tartare, Old City Roll, Fishtown roll, White Tuna Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll. We really enjoyed the tuna tartare and the Old City Roll, although the rock shrimp on Old City Roll were not cooked as tender as the first time we went. The fish in the other rolls was very good quality, but we were not too impressed by the overall rolls themselves. \n\nMost recently we were here on a Thursday and there was supposedly a happy hour on the lychee martini that featured the drink for $5. We were told when we sat down around 7pm that the happy hour was still going on and we could order the martini with the discounted price, which we did. The martini was delicious, however, when we went to pay the bill, our drinks were listed as full price and the same waitress we had since he beginning of the meal told us that we ordered after the happy hour was over. Therefore I would say the service we received was not the best...\n\nOverall I am hesitant about coming back here, especially because Kisso and Tomo are two other great japanese restaurants within a block radius."

I hoped it would also have food for non sushi lovers and thankfully it does. \n\nUpon walking in i noticed the restaurant has a nice warm modern decor. I ordered a bunch of items with my dinner companion and we shared. We ordered dumplings, edamame, lobster fried rice, shrimp tempura sushi, and bone-in steak. The dumplings were good, but not as flavorful as the best dumplings I've tasted. The lobster fried rice was the standout. It's a large delicious bowl, with enough lobster to actually taste, and you have plenty to take home at the end. The steak was a perfectly cooked and juicy medium. But it was a fatty piece of steak. I had to trim some of the fat myself, which was slightly annoying. But once the fat was trimmed I was in steak heaven.  Remember, I'm not a fan of sushi but I did enjoy the shrimp tempura sushi. Guess I can like sushi as long as the fish is cooked. I also had a rum & coke, which was mixed well but missing the lime. The bar probably focuses on fancier cocktails as opposed to the old classics. \n\nTuna Bar is a welcome addition to Old City."

Everything very good.\n\nPeanut avocado rolls - good but wouldn't get again\nCooked:\nCreamy rock shrimp - would def get again\nWentz/Hurts Rolls - would get again because I don't eat raw and there's not too many cooked rolls options \nWasabi fried rice - we split between 2 people and it's hard for me to have wasabi but I managed to enjoy enough of it. It's light but you still do feel it in your nose. \n\nHas raw fish so I did not try but am told they were very good and they looked very good to me.

Beware of the specials though, those prices add up! We had a 3 piece fatty tuna special for $21 and 2 piece yellowtail for $20. That's $41 for 5 pieces of fish. Coulda had 12 mediocre takeout rolls for that price, so it's hard to wrap my head around. But it was really good! They also had some fun looking fancy rolls and we tried the Fishtown Roll -with jalapeno and assorted fish wrapped around shrimp tempura which was very good.\n\nWe also enjoyed some apps and sides- the bang bang shrimp, brussel sprouts, lobster fried rice (large portion), and the wok fried crudo were all very good. Before we knew it our check was about $100 each. Not sure if there was dessert, since our waiter just brought the check and rushed us out a bit....\n\nThe place was busy on a Thursday night, despite it being in a bit of an odd location). The waiters seemed a bit stressed and the area they had to navigate was so narrow they seemed to constantly be excusing themselves or squeezing past each other. Hopefully they'll get into the groove of things as time goes on.\n\nNext time you're looking to sit down and really enjoy some melt in your mouth fish not being delivered in under 35 minutes for you to watch with Netflix with, definitely try Tuna Bar!"

Servers seemed to be a little stressed and we had to flag our server down a couple times when we needed something after our initial order.\n\nI typically stick with wine or vodka martinis when I have sushi, but after tasting my friend's cocktail I ordered the same. It was a mezcal drink with lime and jalape\u00f1o syrup that was absolutely delicious. My friend later ordered a gin martini with wasabi -\u00a0the taste was really fresh and interesting but the wasabi wasn't mixed in well and she encountered a few larger nuggets which made the drink a little weird. \n\nWe ordered several plates and highlights for me were the lobster fried rice, crispy rock shrimp, fishtown roll and one of the specials of the day, some fresh yellowtail, which was absolutely incredible. \n\nIf there is dessert on the menu, we wouldn't know, because our check was dropped without us even asking for it.

Although we passed on their drink specials, we did order their $6 dumplings and a spicy salmon roll. As for drinks, we both ordered off of the cocktail list.

I like that they do happy hour at the tables as well - so much more comfortable when there are 4+ people in your party. Their happy hour food specials are great - three types of rolls, and not eensy ones either. The four of us split seven rolls and two bowls of edamame between us, and I was pretty full. We also got two rounds of sake, and the total was about $80 - not bad at all. They also had a happy hour cocktail (sounded too sweet for me), and wine, not sure about beer. But I'm glad I went with the sake - maybe a bit kitschy, but I love how they pour and let the excess spill over into a box.

She helped our party set up a pre-fix menu (from vegetarian options to sharing size portions) - she was amazing! All of the servers were attentive and the food arrived quickly. I highly recommend the tuna flatbread, the yellowtail & scallion roll, the Sindy Roll and their vegetable fried rice. All of which were delicious! Not to mention their cocktails were great also. Perfect for a date night or a night out with your friends. They also have outdoor seating with very cute string lights outside during the Summertime. Highly recommend if you're looking for a sushi restaurant in the city!"

Tina is exceptional (thank you Tina! ) I have eaten here quite often and have never thought to do something like write one of these but I'm really hoping this encourages others to visit Tuna Bar! The food quality is among the freshest in the city with all dishes, and the wide variety of options is a treat every time! The drink selections are excellent as well... just top to bottom they did not miss! Thanks again Tina and crew we love the Tuna Bar!"

Not to mention it's a good looking restaurant with some pretty cool decor and a great ambiance.\n\nWe started with edemame, tuna tartar, tuna curdo and seared tuna salad. They were all amazing but my favorite was the tuna curdo which is basically thin slices of raw tuna in a delicious sauce. Order this app it's incredible.\n\nMoving on to the rolls... We had the old city roll, white dynamite, peppered tuna and some yellowtail sashimi. Let me repeat the quality of fish they serve he is the best I have had period. All of these rolls were extremely tasty but my favorite was the peppered tuna! It comes with an amazing wasabi drizzle and the tuna is pepper crusted.\n\nWe also had a few Sapporo beers and the ladies had cocktails the geisha and the I'll see you lata. They said the cocktails were Great!\n\nWe had such a good time and enjoyed the food so much that we told the owner it was the best sushi we ever had. We are visitors from NYC and tuna bat does it better than any of the upscale sushi spots we have been to in NY. We have even discussed going back to Philly just to have dinner at tuna bar again. Absolutely love this place! Best meal we had in Philly by far!"
