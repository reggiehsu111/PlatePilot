We then walked up to the hostess. They had six tables open as well as people finishing their meals at several other tables. Yet they insisted they could only seat us outside (it was a torrential downpour with thunder and lightning) or at the sushi bar. When we asked about how long it would be to wait for a table they first said about 30 minutes which we agreed to (despite there being 6 open tables) yet then a moment later the manager came over and said it was not possible to wait for a table.\n\nWhile I can not comment on the quality of food I can say their service is absolutely horrendous. I can not fathom why it was impossible to seat us at a table despite the 6 open tables or allow us to wait for one yet we could sit out in the storm or at the bar. I will not be returning here."

Don't judge the quality of the sushi by it's slightly sketchy looking website or less-than-sleek store sign - the sushi is great.\n\nWe got a variety of standard rolls, which had generous portions of fresh fish.  The Reverse Maki (rice on the outside) tend to have more fish than the Hoso Maki (seaweed on the outside), so opt for the former. The Salmon/Avocado was particularly good, although the Yellowtail/Avocado and the Spicy Tuna were also solid choices.  \n\nI'll be back to try one of the sushi entrees!"

It's a great deal and you definitely leave feeling like you got your money's worth.  Their rolls are also to die for.

(if you're trying to remain gluten-free, ask them to hold the crabstick.) the 911 roll is baked salmon and cucumber with some sort of peppery kick. i'm salivating a la pavlov's dog just thinking about these rolls.\n\none star off for lack of consistency in roll size.  at dine-in one night, my mm naruto and 911 rolls were really tiny, but on one of my take-out orders, the same rolls were enormous. \n\nbonus: outdoor seating for when the weather is nice."

As much as I appreciate the roll names referencing my favorite past time (being a long suffering Philadelphia sports junkie) the flavor was just a bit underwhelming. The regular roll on the other hand was extremely fresh, the white tuna melted in my mouth and their spicy sauce was to die for. \n\nOur waitress wasn't that great and forgot our appetizers and our drink requests however each time she failed to come through for us one of the other waiters would ask us if everything was ok despite the restaurant being packed and you could tell that everyone took a lot of pride in making sure all the patrons had a good experience. \n\nI would probably go back from take out and I wish them all the luck in the world.

My boyfriend asked for diet coke a couple of times and never got it--finally he gave up after we were halfway done with our sushi. We had a groupon for $30 worth of sushi so we decided to go all out and order the following: Nutty Roll, McNabb, Sweet paradise, New volcano roll, and Godzilla roll. We figured we'd just take home whatever we couldn't finish. Well, when our server brought out the rolls on a big boat that was too big for our table, our server said, \"oh yeah, guess he thought it was a big table with all the rolls you ordered!\" Way to make us feel guilty lol.  Anyways, besides that, the rolls were decent. The Sweet Paradise was definitely the best roll out of our selections. It tasted fresh. This place is BYOB and can sit large groups so those are pluses. But I think we concluded we'll  go here for big parties,  but when it's just us two, we'll definitely keep going to our other regular sushi places."

Poor customer service and unimpressive fish. \n\nThe sushi was very meh the first time, but my roommate and I decided to give them one more try based on reviews. I think a lot of people leaving the good reviews have never had good sushi because Makiman is definitely sub par. \n\nAnyway, the second time I ordered some kind of fancy/special shrimp tempura roll and a salmon avocado roll. I don't know how hot the tempura roll was when they packaged it, but it made the salmon roll really warm. Not the rice, but the whole thing. Warm raw fish is not good and it grossed me out to where I couldn't eat it. I could have let this slide, but they also gave me a regular shrimp tempura roll instead of the one I ordered and paid for that cost double. I gave them a call about the roll and mentioned the warm salmon. The guy was super rude and told me that he's \"been packaging sushi for 10 years and no one ever complained about this.\" Ok, jerk. I've been eating sushi for 10 years and never complained about this because it's never happened. \n\nHe told me he would credit the extra $7 for the shrimp tempura from my next order.

Three fusion rolls, soup, and an app for just north of $30. \n\nThe dark wood and deep colors give this a nice interior behind the cold, slightly strip mall feel of the exterior, but a wait staff clad in t-shirts felt a bit disjointed, lending itself to a dive bar kind of feel.

We were in a hurry, so we figured if we ordered take out it would be faster.  I asked the hostess if that was true and she said yes.  They had several specials with crab in them, and I had a groupon so I was willing to splurge on the fancy sushi.  We ordered and then sat down to wait.  Probably 25 minutes go by and the waitress comes over to tell Katrina they are out of crab, and she has to pick a different roll.  Now, they didn't say anything to me, so we figured I must have gotten the last of it.  Well, about 10 minutes later the waitress came to let me know that two of the rolls I ordered were no longer available.  I replaced one with something different, and requested that the other just have the crab changed to something else.  About 15 minutes after that, we finally got our food.  It took about 45 minutes for this process to go down, which caused us to be really late for the party, so we actually requested to just sit at a table and eat our food instead of taking it with us.    We specifically told them we had to be somewhere before ordering, so they should have just said they couldn't accommodate us.  Also, probably not a good idea to make crab the ingredient in every roll, and then not have enough.  I have no major complaints about the sushi, although apparently the spicy salmon was lacking in spice.  It didn't wow me though, and without a groupon, I won't be back."

I'm not sure that we really needed those reservations, but I'm working towards that big $10 opentable giftcard (after a mere 6 years, I'm about 2/3 of the way there!).

I had a moment of omg-what-the-fuck-was-that-some-sort-of-fish-gristle!?!?!?! panic and then realized it was just  a chunk of tempura.  Weird.  Hard chunks do not belong in tuna tartar and I hit 2 of them. Also my plate had a big chip in it.  Ghetto.  Throw out your chipped plates. I sampled my boyfriend's rock shrimp tempura.  It was good but not the best I've had (Zento's is much better).\n\nI ordered two rolls.  The raw viking roll was my favorite.  It was fresh and tasty.

You can order three things at a time and they'll come back for another order when you can prove you can finish what you got. Careful - they'll charge you a bit if you order more than you can handle. \n\nThey have some creative (and all the standard) rolls on the menu, and the sashimi is very tasty. \n\nAdd to that the Yelp check-in deal and you're set."

Service was excellent and the waitress was helpful in pointing out which dishes she really likes.  Kept our water glasses filled, which we appreciate too.\n\nWe started with an appetizer which had yellowtail and vegetables wrapped in seaweed, then tempura batter and deep fried. It was really good! And a different kind of appetizer than the usual dumplings.  For rolls we got the Viking Raw, Blind Date, White Tuna, and Shrimp Tempura. All were really good. The majority of the rolls came with spicy tuna (which i like) with slight variations.  Our bill came to $45 before the groupon discount which I think is very reasonable.\n\nIt is byo. Reasonable prices. Has outdoor seating. Good location right off broad (plenty of places to go for another drink). They give you metal chopsticks - not the cheap wood kind, which is a nice touch.  \n\nThe only drawback was the music they were playing. It was a mix of techno and electronica that was kind of loud.  They should adjust that and play more dinner-type music because the decor and inside of the restaurant is really nice, updated, and modern.  \n\nI would go back! :)"

I started with the miso soup, and continued and got the sweet potato roll, the salmon avocado roll, and the spicy tuna roll. The quality of the food was great, and fresh but the portions seemed a bit small than other places I've been to in the area. But over all the food was good. And its BYOB, who doesn't love that?!\n\nThe service on the other hand was a little feeble. First it took the girl over 5 minutes to bring us water, which she didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. When she took our order, one of the other girls I was with stated she \"might\" have wanted something on the appetizer menu, and she jumped the gun and wrote it down anyway almost like she was in a hurry, but we had her take it off. Second she didn't give us as much attention as I thought a server should. It looked like some of her friends had come in and she was spending a lot of time at their table. We just felt like every time she did pay attention to us it was an inconvenience to her."

We decided pretty last minuted to go out to dinner and called them a little after 7pm (on a Friday!).  They sounded crazy busy on the phone but said we could come at 8:30.  We showed up a few minutes before and the place was pretty full (and they were setting up for a large group which took up 3-4 tables).  We had to wait about 15min for some tables to clear out and we ended up at the sushi bar.  \n\nThe menu is pretty huge and they have sushi and non sushi options (bi bim bap,udon, terriyaki etc).  We went for sushi so that's what we spent the most time pondering.  The place was super busy and it took them a little bit to take our order, but one of the sushi makers was super on top of things and had someone come over as soon as he noticed we were no longer absorbed in the menu choices.  We started with the veggie tempura which was well done and the dipping sauce was really tasty (more like a broth than a sauce).  There was carrot, sweet potato, asparagus, onion, broccoli, and cucumber.  Yum!  \n\nFor the sushi we got: Raw Viking Roll, The Stallion Roll, Sweet Potato Tempura Roll (I loveee sweet potatoes), and a normal yellowtail roll.  I have to say they were all well done.  I hadn't had torched sushi before so the Stallion was my first time, I was a little wary since I generally prefer raw fish to cooked fish but it was soooo good!  \n\nSo after this great experience, we decided to keep it going and ordered the tempura vanilla ice cream.  It was HUGE.  At $8 I was a little wary of ordering it since I figured it would be small, but goodness did they give us a ton.  It was gorgeously presented with fresh cut strawberries, and giant mounds of both tempura ice cream and whipped cream.  I can't believe we finished it, but I'll admit that we did.  I wish we had taken pictures of everything, but we both left our phones behind so that we wouldn't get distracted (ok really I just forgot my damn phone!).  \n\nAfter all of this the bill was only $60 ($55 pre tax).  After the living social was applied it was only $30, yayyyyyy.  Had it been a little less busy it would have been perfect.  We found out at the end that they were down a server for the evening which had a lot to do with the chaotic nature of the place that night.  \n\nWe don't live far from Makiman and will DEFINITELY be back when we're craving another night of sushi (or maybe for lunch if we want some bi bim bap!)."

The miso soup was watery and flavorless, the ginger salad dressing was ok, but not great and even the green tea was disappointing. They made a whole pot of tea with one tea bag, so it basically was like drinking hot water. My main dish was the Salmon Stone Pot. The salmon was fine but the dish overall really lacked flavor despite dousing it with the two sauces served with it. My date had sushi and a special spicy tuna tempura appetizer.

Definitely a solid offering - upside, you get 6 pieces which is more than most sushi places, but downside is it's smaller. IMO, when the softshell crab is that small, you start to lose the flavor of the crab and get more of the soy-based sauce and/or avocado. \n\nLovely things: BYOB, attentive and friendly staff, speedy food delivery, takes rezzies, relatively inexpensive for sushi and they don't rush you out. \n\nSushi aside, I really enjoyed the agedashi tofu - Makiman's version of this dish comes with a LOT of bonita flakes.

The fish was so old, discolored and nasty I could only eat about half of it.  Nasty is actually an understatement... this fish was downright scary.  \n\nThe yellowtail tuna was nearly grey, with a disturbingly fishy taste.  The salmon had no overtly disgusting  flavor (making it one of the better bites on the plate) but instead had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, as well as a weird off putting texture.  You have no idea how much I regret even sampling the mucous-y, overwhelmingly fishy squid.  This meal was so bad I really didn't even feel like revisiting it in order to write this, but I thought you, dear reader, deserved this public service announcement.  \n\nAvoid Makiman at all costs.  I would tell you to go to Vic's instead, but really, go anywhere instead.  I've never had worse sushi in my entire life."

We called in and had no problem ordering (sometime, the language barrier makes it difficult to order) and we were told we should expect our food in 40 minutes. They delivered on time but the delivery man took a little while to find the apartment building (which is really not hard to find) but he was nice and apologized for letting us wait when he came in.\nMy friend had the MM Naruto roll and an order of squid and I had the tropical roll and the lobster tempura roll. My order was just really good and I always am a big fan of mangoes in sushi so I was really happy with the tropical roll. I will order from there again."

I agree with Jon W. that it looks like a take out Chinese restaurant in between a deli and a parking garage and I walked by it countless times with out even noticing it was there. We got a recommendation from a friend saying this was the best sushi in the city so we had to try it out. I'm not a huge sushi eater so I can't say if its literally the best or not but everything I had there was great! \n\nMy favorite is the caterpillar roll with seaweed salad and that they have Groupons all the time! They also have fee delivery so Makiman is now my go-to if I'm in the mood for sushi. You can also say their clever little slogan (Do you like it raw?) that they have on everything, adds to the fun."

I would say,, Makiman is not-so-bad if you have a deal for it. Most sushi places are pricey and if I had  to make a choice, I would go to a different sushi restaurant that has more \"flavor\". \n\nThe fish were fresh enough..but I just didn't get the WOW impression on the appetizer and 2 rolls. Also, I can get full enough with 3 things ordered at other  sushi places, but at Makiman I left w an unsatisfied belly. I did like how they didn't try to stuff the sushi with lots of rice just to fill up the customers and make the rolls look bigger.\n\nIf I could say something good about it, the sushi variety you can choose from is great. It made it harder for me choose what I wanted to order, but if you're the type of person that wants a huge list, Makiman has it. The interior was nicer than what I expected. \n\nIf you want to go to a BYOB sushi place, I guess Makiman could be an option. But if you want to spend your money on real good sushi, I wouldn't recommend it. If another groupon deal comes out, maybe i'll go again. It was just one of those places \"Yeh I'll go if you really want to go\"."

This is a Korean and Japanese restaurant so there is Japanese cuisine like sushi and ramen, and Korean cuisine like kimchi and bibimap. I order the miso ramen, my husband ordered the stone bowl bibimap. Service was slow, especially considering we were the only ones at the restaurant. When we received our meals, I was disappointed. The ramen was not very good, the hard boiled egg was incredible hard and chewy. The pork belly was too thick and fatty. My husband's stone bowl bibimap was barely hot. Usually the bibimap sort of cooks in the bowl but this was just bibimap thrown in a barely warm stone bowl.\n\nThe price was fine but I was just overall disappointed with the food and experience."

The couple we were with are new to the wonderful world of sushi, and gave us the liberty of ordering for them. Hallelujah!! Surely it would've been catastrophic to come here and be subjected to California rolls all night with narrow-minded company...but they were cool. \n\nWe started off with the Tuna Nachos. In a word: Divine. We also got the Sixers, Cap-N-Crunch, Shrimp-N-Eel, Rainbow, Lobster Tempura, and Sweet Potato Rolls. Everyone raved about the freshness and quality of the rolls as we dug in and were really enjoying the experience. I was almost stuffed and had one roll yet to try: The sweet potato.\n\nWait a minute. Where's the sweet potato roll, guys? You ate them all?? Everyone (except me) claimed to have one each =3. I inquired with the server how many pieces it's usually cut into and she replied \"5 or 6\". Er?? Well, I'm no mathematician but I'm pretty sure 3 is not equal to 5 or 6. The server then insisted that we must've mistaken one of the other rolls for the sweet potato and then walked away. \n\nYou're kidding me, right?? Well damn, I'm obviously not Japanese and eat more fried chicken than sushi, but I think I know Lobster tempura from sweet potato tempura...feel me? On top of all this, we were overcharged for two of the rolls, which the server corrected AFTER I brought it to her attention. (Sheesh, I'm glad I have a photographic memory....I hope you do too if you go here)\n\nSN: My double date friend called me today to tell me she loved the sweet potato roll so much she ordered it for lunch today and had it delivered...Although she said it was quite tasty, I don't need to tell ya that it wasn't 5 or 6 pieces when it arrived, do I??... Arrrgghhh, mayyybe one day I'll get to taste that roll....\n\nOverall, I would go back...preferably if someone else was paying. It was good to step out of the box and see Center City's sushi offerings as we normally have our raw fish in the 'burbs."

Went again last night because, though I'm no sushi expert, the sushi has always been fresh, it's affordable and BYOB and you never need a reservation.  Generally when we've been here we've tried the fusion rolls.  It's not traditional maki but the combinations are often amazing.  Last night we had the \"Sixers\" roll.  It's shrimp tempura rolled with a piece of spicy tuna on top drizzled in a spicy eel sauce.  The presentation was beautiful (see my photo) and it was delicious, just a little bit of kick (No wasabi needed! Usually I'm throwing wasabi all over every bite.).  A bit of crunch, a bit of soft sushi for that complex mouth feel.  We also tried vegetarian Bi Bim Bop in the stone pot last night and it was good, but generally I would stick with the interesting fusion rolls and traditional nigiri.  Service has been mixed but always pleasant.  Again, worth trying for consistently good rolls, affordability and BYO in a center city setting."

I just went there with a large party on Tuesday night for a farewell dinner for a great friend... and the meal really couldn't have been better.\n\nFirst of all, its a BYOB.  This is HUGGGEE in my book as a lot of sushi restaurants have kind of a strange selection of booze.  I enjoy a good saki, but sometimes i just want a light beer or a glass of wine, and this puts me in the driver seat... which is just where i like to be.\n\nSecond of all, i love the seating options.  On a nice night, you can dine al fresco and people-watch, while drinking your own booze.  If you prefer, they have inside seating.  The decor is on the nicer side of standard for your standard sushi restaurant, and the tables are comfy.\n\nThen there's the service.  We had a HUGE order with lots of special order intricate details... and they nailed it.  We had people show up late, as the food was coming out, and they managed to turn around their sushi order at warp speed so they could dine with us.  We ordered the boat... they sailed it our way looking BEAUTIFUL.  All while being so kind and hospitable.  Our wine was opened immediatly, the check was brought promptly, it was just really easy!\n\nLast, but certainly not least, there's the food.  This place has the best sushi I've found.  As a vegetarian, my options are a bit limited, and can get dull and boring... but this place has kajillions of options.  The sushi chef is super flexible too.  He put quail egg on inari for me.  They have the popeye roll, the tempura sweet potato and broccoli roll (my fav x 1000), the tempura roll, fujumaki roll... just lots and lots of great options.  None of which have ever disappointed.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake- the prices are SO reasonable!  A whole dinner for 2 for $30 (with me the vegetarian... as i tend to be a cheap date).  \n\nI really have nothing awful to say about this place.  Even the bathrooms were immaculate.  We come here often, and will keep coming back."

The dish comes with miso soup, which I love, and a salad with a soy sauce-based dressing, which I passed on to my friends. \n\nI enjoyed the tuna-avocado reverse-maki, and the Boston roll (salmon, lettuce, tobiko, avocado, cucumber, and mayo). I thought the Tiger roll (spicy white tuna and cucumber) was delicious. Thank god for a spicy sauce with no soy sauce in it! Just make sure they don't drizzle teriyaki sauce on top, and you're good to go. \n\nI was super excited to see ginger icecream on the menu, but they told me they don't carry it any more.

When I arrived I found a sign explaining that there had been a blackout (affected the nearby Starbucks as well) and the restaurant would be closed until PECO got the power restored. Still stuck on the idea of sushi, I walked over to the nearby Makiman and decided to give it a try.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that their lunch specials are excellent deals- I opted for 3 rolls and a soup or salad for $9.95. My friend chose the 2 roll special for $6.95 and her brother ordered the sushi lunch, which comes with 4 pieces of California roll and 5 pieces of sushi for $7.95. All three of these choices are super affordable, and I was thrilled at how tasty the rolls were.\n\nUnlike some other places with roll specials (Jay's, I'm talking to you...), these were served with an ample amount of fish. All ingredients were fresh and I really couldn't ask for anything more. I was even able to use the 15% yelp check-in coupon to get 3 rolls and a salad for $8.50!!!\n\nThe only reason this isn't getting 5 stars is because I ordered 3 spicy rolls but only received one. The other two - yellow tail and salmon - came without any spicy sauce. The spicy tuna, however, actually had some kick to it, something I've found is very rare at sushi restaurants (sounds silly but it's true!).\n\nDefinitely a fantastic place to go for lunch specials. I'm sure it's great for dinner too, and am looking forward to returning to try out some of the specialty rolls!"

I came here with 10 friends for a birthday party centered on Makiman's BYOB perk and was amazed by every aspect of the meal.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were expecting Hasu Japanese, which I had actually found on Yelp last week, but it turns out that placed opened and closed in the blink of an eye, and Makiman took over. \n\nNo mind the brief confusion. As we entered the restaurant, we were immediatedly seated and the hostess assessed our bottles-in-tow and told us she would get us a bucket of ice and glasses for our sake, red wine, brandy... beer... ok, so we brought a LOT of booze with us, and the staff was nothing but smiles about it. I swear we must have cleaned out their entire cupboards of glassware, because all eleven of us must have had at least three different glasses to our person. \n\nDespite the fact that we had brought our own drinks, the staff provided us with unlimited, FREE caraffs of hot sake (complete with little ceramic cups), which they diligently refreshed everytime they visited our table (we were drinking like champs!). We were also graced with a free and DELICIOUS wonton cracker nacho-type appetizer with guacamole and raw tuna. These guys definitely have the 'fusion' thing going on... I didn't scrutinize the menu too deeply because our party opted for a \"Party Boat\" of sushi and sashimi (which came with salad and miso for all), but one of my friends ordered some sort of pork burrito appetizer that was also quite good. \n\nAfter all was said and done, our check for a group of 11 topped the scales at UNDER $100, including an 18% gratuity. So, folks, I think this place wins. And I encourage you all to pop in for a visit while they're still in their 'grand opening' phase and score yourself some freebies. I'll definitely be back."

It's got kani, cooked shrimp, tempura flakes, spicy mayo, and cucumber and it's seriously one of the best things I've ever tried. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because its a bit pricy but it's worth it."

Plenty of seats on a Wednesday night, but i can imagine it getting crowded on a weekend.  Service was pleasant and the food came out fairly quick, but as other reviewers have pointed out, I can see this place being hectic/slow if it filled up.\n\nSushi was very good, nice and fresh.  Prices are average ($5 for a tuna roll).  The groupon obviously made a difference though, i may not have enjoyed paying full price.  Definately have a large selection of special rolls to choose from.  P.S. its byob.\n\nThis may be one of those rare places we go back to even without a groupon!  Thats unthinkable normally."

I was searching for something I had never tired so I went with the Hai duk bop or Sashimi rice salad, something I've been dying to try.  I also orderd a seaweed because I didn't realize it came with miso soup and salad.  The sashimi rice salad consisted of 4 types of fish (salmon, tuna, whitefish, white tuna), and some shredded kani atop sushi rice, strips of nori, shredded lettuce, cucumber, seaweed salad, some shredded white radish and red chili sauce on the side to mix in as you please.  It definitely lived up to my expections and the size of it was huge!  I was only able to finish half, and took the rest to go.\n\nDefinitely plan on heading back to try other items on the menu.

I've ordered take out another dozen times and delivery once or twice as well.\n\nI usually get the avocado maki and the veggie tempura roll.  The rolls are always well constructed, though the veggie tempura roll is about three bites and somewhat difficult to eat (about the size of an 8 year old's fist--if I had to guess), but delicious.  The avocado is always ripe and fresh.  The wasabi seems to me to be a bit mild,  so keep that in mind when using it to accompany your sushi. \n\nThey also have a large specialty roll menu. Make sure you check all check in apps to see if they have any specials.  Last time I did, it was buy one specialty roll, get one free.

We had a great long table next to the window. Of course a few from my party were late for our reservation including myself but the waitress was very accommodating and always had a smile on her face.\n\nMy husband and I started out with a Tuna Nacho-one word: AMAZING! ,Tuna Tar Tar-very flavorful, and the rest of the party was very satisfied with their appetizer selections. Another thing that was a surprise to me was that they had a large selection of hot dishes other than just sushi.\n\nWe also ordered the following over the course of the night: McNabb roll- a must try!!! ,NEViking roll-  delicious!, Sixers roll- my husbands favorite! Capn crunch and Lobster roll- very good, and one of my GF ordered the Unagi Bi Bim Bop- Its like the best of both worlds Bi Bim Bop and eel (VERY TASTEFUL). The green tea ice cream is a must have to end the night here.\n\nOver all the sushi rolls we ordered were fantastic and very fresh tasting. Everyone agreed the preparation of the sushi is of high quality and I have to say the portions were great too.

Their NE Philly location was my go-to spot when I lived around the corner from it, but now that I'm in the city primarily, this Spruce St location is where it's at. Monday night is all you can eat sushi. Yes I judge a Japanese restaurant by its miso soup, if you don't get it right, you aren't worth your stock (get it?) But anyway, needless to say, Makiman does a fine job with their miso. But of course what you want to know about are the rolls, right!? of course! there's so many I haven't tried them all, but the ones I have are always delicious, neatly prepared and very fresh. I usually go with the Sashimi platter which has never disappointed. Its a favorite for me and my friends. My rolls of choice are the Kappa Maki (cucumber) and the Negi-Sake (Salmon with scallions) those are personal favorites of mine and Makiman makes them just how I like. For dessert, ginger ice cream.

Yes, finding a quality byo that can seat you on a Saturday night is so golden. And I got just that. (So lucky, I know)\n\nWe were promptly seated upon arrival and had our wine bottle opened. We were so hungry!!! We ordered fried kimchi dumplings, miso soup, seaweed salad, spicy tuna sandwich, spider roll, Naruto roll, yellow stallion roll to share between two of us. Did I mention we were hungry? Yes. \n\nEverything was very tasty but the highlight was definitely the Naruto roll. Cucumber wrap filled with fresh tuna, salmon and crab stick was more than enough fix for the sushi need. Also, the service was very quick and friendly!\n\nOne negative was a very large group that was dining when we got there...really loud and since the restaurant layout was pretty open, we were not saved from all the laughter, and borderline screaming of the conversations. So if you're looking for a quiet and intimate night out, I wouldn't go on a Saturday night. \n\nOtherwise, please pay a visit! I can't wait to go back and try out more items on the menu...there are an extensive list of specialty rolls that must be tried!"

It was very good!\n\nTo start I wanted to try their clam soup, but they ran out of it, so I went with the pork dumpling soup, expecting something kind of boring (even though I still wanted to have just some soup). Well no, surprise...great flavors, dumplings were delicious, the broth was so tasty, overall best dumpling soup I have had so far. We also had some seaweed salad, felt fresh.\n\nThen we had some rolls. The salmon avocado cucumber roll, simple yet very tasty. Out of the fusion sushi rolls, we had the Ne Viking roll and the Menabb. Both superb.  We usually keep it simple when eating sushi, but the menu is so extensive, that I am willing to take a risk and try other stuff when we go back.\n\nThe place was packed (thanks to living social) yet service was efficient and very friendly.\n\nWill definitely go back."

They tucked me away in a corner and completely neglected me for the entire meal, I had to get out of my seat to request more water as the waitresses and bartender chatted in the back.\n\nI came in specifically to order the ramen burger. It comes in a foil wrapping to hold it together. The ramen noodles are fried to a crispness so it tasted less like noodles and more like a thin crunchy bun. There is a barely cooked egg that covers absolutely everything in yolk which smells really strong and makes for one of the messiest meals in my life. I honestly don't remember much of the taste other than the egg yolk.\n\nIt might be easier if they give up on making the ramen burger something you eat with your hands and just present it as a fork-knife meal."

Not the best Sushi in the city, but never disappointing either, especially for the price. Try the Sixers Roll! Would have given another star but I feel like they are a little stingy with the actual fish in the rolls.... \nThey always have Groupons or Living Social deals out, but even with out one its not too expensive."

From their Veggie Tempura roll to Bibimbap, everything I've ever tried has been seriously great and their delivery is always here within less than a half an hour (our delivery guy is like 60 and he rides a scooter)! Their other location is just as good. I don't normally dine like this, but I really don't feel the need to order from elsewhere else right now.\n\nThe only downside is one of their hostesses on the phone who must have sashimi in her ears. We tried to correct our order over the phone with her a minute after submitting it and spotting a mistake. When the order showed up x2 as wrong as the way we submitted it, she told me it was my fault because I'm the one who said it that way, which wasn't true. She was very quick to imply that I was wrong before hearing me out. Not appreciated, phone sashimi girl!\n\nPhone sashimi girl sucks, but the sushi is great!"

The place wasn't huge, but there were plenty of room and not feeling cramped.  The server attended to us the moment we sat down.  She opened our bottles of wine and chilled them right away and best of all NO CORKAGE FEE.\n\nThe menu was easy to read.  They have the traditional sushi and sashimi plus they have many new creative fushion dishes.  I especially LOVED the Tuna Nacho, so much flavor and crunchy.  All the sushi rolls were beautifully presented.  The McNabb Roll was very creative and delicious.  There was also this tropical roll with mango which was very refreshing.  Another creative dish that they have was the Unagi Bi Bim Bop with eel. This is one of those that was so simple like adding 1+1 together but how can I not have thought about it?  I  had many Bi Bim Bop before, but I never really like the crispy rice part because most were to burnt.  This place made it perfect.  Just slightly crisp but not too hard or burnt.  \n\nOverall, service and food was great.  Friendly Staff and Delicious Food, you can't go wrong.  We had a pretty large group and we were there for a very long time even after we finished all the food, but they didn't rush us or anything.  Some of my friends lives in the area and were excited that they deliver.  I would definitely come back to this place."

My first impression upon unwrapping the food was:  why are these rolls so tiny, and did they really need to give us soy sauce packets?\n\nThe fish was of pretty good quality, the yellowtail particularly being the freshest I've had in a while, but my major issue with the sushi was the rice.  It was all wrong: hard, bland, cold, but thankfully not abundant.  Thinking about that rice still makes me shudder; it ruined the whole experience for me.  The fish portion in the rolls is pretty generous aside from the rolls being somewhat smaller than I'm used to, but there was some unevenness to their slicing technique so a few pieces were all rice and avocado with hardly any fish.  \n\nAltogether we ordered dumpling soup, yellowtail scallion, salmon avocado, salmon cucumber, tuna avocado, a rainbow roll, and a special roll I can't remember.  The soup was not very successful.  The dumpling wrappers became mushy and fell apart in the broth, the filling wasn't very cohesive, and the broth was overly smoky miso-flavoured without the cloudy deliciousness of a good miso soup.  \n\nEly enjoyed his special roll the most, and from looking at other reviews and the photos on their hardcopy menu that the delivery guy brought, this seems to be their forte.  However, I find the lack of quality in the standard roll offerings to be a definite deal-breaker, as when I order sushi I'm not interested in spending $10+ dollars/roll for rolls filled with fried things and spicy mayo.  Terryin has not yet been overthrown as our go-to sushi delivery joint even despite their recent quality issues.  If I'm going to get hit-or-miss sushi, I'd rather spend a dollar less per roll."

On Mondays, they have an all-you-can-eat sushi special (you know what that means - but a deal is a deal). Pro tip? It's a BYO! So with a bottle of Beringer Sauvignon Blanc in tow, the GF and I stopped for by dinner.\n\nSalad\n\nWe got one of the larger party boat specials, which came with salad to start. This came dressed with standard ginger dressing that was slightly watery, atop field greens, carrots, and cucumber. Some of the pieces of lettuce were a bit wilted, but other than that - fairly standard.\n\nSpicy Tuna Tartare [$9.95]\n\nThe tuna tartare had good flavor, but was a bit too finely 'chopped' for my liking. There was nice texture from the crispy tempura chunks throughout and tobiko helped to provide nice bursts of flavor as well. \n\nVegetable Tempura [$6.95] \n\nWhile the tempura was a bit over-battered and could have been crisper, the veggies were well-seasoned and fresh.\n\nRock Shrimp [$9.50] \n\nThe rock shrimp's batter was better - crisp and well-seasoned. The juicy shrimp was tossed in a sauce that nicely balanced between sweet and spicy. \n\nMiso Soup\n\nThe miso soup was pretty standard with small cubes of tofu. The broth wasn't overly saline, which I appreciated. \n\nParty Boat 1 [$34.95]\n\nThe Party Boat 1 was plenty of sushi for 1. A bounty was on offer, including maguro (tuna),  kurodai (black sea bream), sake (salmon), hirame (fluke), hamachi (yellowtail) with scallion/yuzu, suzuki (striped bass), sweet ebi (cooked shrimp), and saba (mackerel) with jalapeno to temper the mackerel's intensity. Overall, the sushi was fresh. We also received \"white tuna,\" which was really escolar (which I love due to the high fat content). The tobiko and pickled ginger helped to offset the fattiness.\n\nCalifornia Roll \n\nWe also received a California roll, which was standard, but the GF loves its simplicity.\n\nUni / Sea Urchin [$6.50] \n\nI had to order the uni, which had decent butteriness, though didn't taste especially fresh.\n\nSweet Potato Roll [$5.50]\n\nThe GF always craves the sweet potato roll (won't lie - I love it too). This particular order was especially starchy and wasn't crisp - a let down. \n\nThe service was friendly, though wasn't completely knowledgeable. Perhaps we came on an off-night, but the sushi rice was a bit too cold and seemed over-cooked and overpowered some of the sushi. Makiman Sushi offers an affordable option for sushi in the city, but there are definitely better BYO options out there."

If I had to choose, the best of the 3 was the McNabb.\n\nThe salad that came out looked like the dressing and the components were all assembled in the morning (it looked flat). The miso soup was just OK.\n\nTHE SUSHI IS NOT FRESH. It looked and tasted like it's been precut and been sitting out for a while.

But to convince him to accompany me to the Kimmel Center's free holiday tuba concert, I enticed him with the promise of a sushi dinner. \n\nWe've passed Makiman Sushi endless times but never tried them because I don't like how some of their special rolls are priced (seriously, combinations are not that unique and cost more than at most other places, but in particular you pay waaaaay more for raw - ridiculous considering their slogan is \"Do You Like It Raw?\"!). But Makiman is right across the street from the Kimmel and since we had limited time to go from the concert to dinner to a holiday party we went there. \n\nThe servers were really great, very friendly and eager to explain the menu if we had questions. We didn't want to spend too much, which influenced our choices. I had miso soup (fine) and my bf had the pork dumpling soup (yum!). We shared the tuna tartar, which was tasty, and three rolls: blind date, tiger, and a vegetable roll I can't remember. The rolls were fine, nothing special, and the fish quality was good but nothing to squeal over. The rice was kinda...meh...and there was too much of it. With rolls like these, I should be able to fit the whole thing in mouth tiny mouth, but I had to either bite a few in half or remove rice from the exterior. At the end of our meal, my bf turned to me and proclaimed that he never wanted to eat there again. I countered that if we were ever in a group where some wanted sushi and others didn't, Makiman would be a good compromise AND would probably be able to seat a group for sushi, unlike all of the small sushi joints elsewhere. So now I know that we will probably never, ever get sushi from there again, and I can live with that. There are more than enough choices with better fish, better special rolls, and better or at least equal prices."

The Sixers rolll (shrimp tempura on inside and spicy tuna on outside) was one of my favorite.  There was also this Mamma roll that was very large and had egg in it- it was nothing like any sushi that ever had  and it was amazing and unique. I also loved the Sweet Potato roll. I've also never heard of an Atkins roll and wasn't sure about it until I ordered it. The Atkins roll is a hand roll and is made up of fish and radish (instead of rice); to my surprise this was delicious. \n\nMakiman has a very large selection of sushi and other meals. Prices are reasonable. Service was great. It's byob which is great but they do charge a nominal cork fee (which I never encountered at the one in the NE and don't remember seeing that on the menu).

After some discussion, the answer struck us; Sushi!. Our party of five wisely made a reservation, as we arrived to find only two tables unoccupied on a busy Friday night. We had to wait a few minutes while the hostess quickly prepared one for us.\n\nMakiman seems a bit of a tight space at first. There isn't much of a lobby or waiting area, and the front door pretty much puts you right into the center of the restaurant. There are two slightly separated dinning areas, each with about a half dozen tables, and another sushi bar area further back. Once we were seated, it didn't feel quite as small, and impressively the overall noise of the room didn't make conversation impossible. New guests arriving do end up waiting right in the middle of everything,\n\nIt's a BYO, and our server spotted my bottle of sake and asked if I wanted it heated, which I declined, instead asking for it to be chilled with our beer. As an aside, if you bring sake, check how it should be served, like wine different types of sake are served differently. She brought out the appropriate glassware and we started opening our bottles.\n\nThe soup and salad were pretty much par for the course, the usual miso soup and seaweed/microgreen salad you get at most sushi places. We also started with an appetiser of spicy rock shrimp tempura, which was fantastic, the sauce, tempura batter and shrimp were well balanced and didn't convey the greasiness of everyday tempura.\n\nFor entrees, most of the table chose a mix of rolls and pieces, but I went for the Chirashi. It came out with several generously sized pieces of several different sashimi, including tuna, salmon, shrimp, octopus, among others. It was well presented in an angled bowl atop a good amount of sushi rice, ginger and wasabi. Each type of sashimi tasted fresh, but I thought the salmon and tuna were the best of the group.\n\nAnother friend of mine chose one of the bi bim bop bowls, and that will certainly be something I go back for. They have several different options to choose between. The various rolls I saw around the table certainly looked tasty as well, and I managed to trade for one or two to confirm that.\n\nWe also chose to go with deserts, and both the banana tempura and ice cream proved a good choice to split. On a future visit, I'd definitely recommend the banana tempura. Also, we enjoyed the wooden boats being carried out filled with sushi, which would be a fine choice for another time.\n\nThe bill was reasonable, and being a BYO you can bring in ample sushi or other drinks to enjoy with your meal. Given the location, Reservations are probably a must over the weekend. They also do takeout and delivery it seems."

The yellowtail, salmon, and sea urchin, for example, were all solidly average.  If I were to return, I would go for one of the lunch deals, which seem to provide fair value.  Decor is standard-issue sushi joint with dark wooden furniture."

This is a really good rating and Makiman was only a few blocks from my hotel so I thought I'd try it.  Maybe my expectations were too high, because I thought it was just a bit above average.  I'd give it a 3.5 and I'd go back, but I think I would rather check out a few other places first.\n\nI was sitting at the sushi bar and I avoided ordering any generic white fish because a few pieces looked old and dried out at the edges.  I was able to see what I was going to be ordering and all of the nigiri and maki were good.  Service was a bit weird, three different people wanted to take my order and later when I needed the tea refilled, no server was around.  The guy working the sushi bar would have taken care of it, but he was busy and I didn't want to bother him.  If I caught them on a bad night, their good nights are probably very good."

Every time it has been very good, reasonably priced, convenient location, usually never busy for a weekend night dinner. It is a go-to BYOB spot. Went one night with friends and drank many bottles of wine and were there for awhile but they did not rush or hurry us up. They let us just hang out which was nice. \n\nI always order the rainbow roll, spicy tuna, and salmon avocado rolls. No complaints they are always great! And they have brown rice if you ask. \n\nFor what it is, it is a great spot!!"

There was one server working and he was running around the whole time so we didn't see him very often. We had to call out for water refills and flag him down for the check. \n\nI ordered a special roll with spicy tuna inside and torched salmon outside, plus a king crab roll. It's pretty unlike me to not plow through my sushi, leaving no trace, but I actually didn't even finish my rolls. They were fine, but not exceptional. My friend had a few of the larger special rolls and the pieces were cut so large she actually ended up choking on one -\u00a0thankfully, she was fine.  \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was when I went to wash my hands in the restroom and saw how filthy it was. I will not be returning, or ordering from this establishment, again."

Their food is very affordable, and if you don't mind settling for low quality sushi or just okay bi bim bop, you may be okay with Makiman. If you expect more than mediocre, you should probably try somewhere that isn't located in a shopping plaza."

Just got bibimbop and must say that it's pretty good!  \n\nI'm picky with Korean food because I won't pay for what I can make at home.  I've been looking for a decent Korean restaurant in Center City (for lunch), but the other Korean restaurants that I'd been to in Center City were just 'eh'.\n\nMakiman Sushi has very decent bibimbop.  The lunch bibimbop comes with a side miso soup. I'm looking forward to trying other things on their menu.  Too bad they don't have a large variety of Korean food--I guess it's primarily a sushi place."

The guys who work here really take pride in what they do and are eager to answer the questions of newcomers to sushi... like me.\n\nMaybe you read my previous review I hadn't tried sushi in 15 years. So i was eager to try another sushi restaurant.  Again, everything was delightful!  Presentation was excellent and the service was extremely considerate.\n\nWe came in later at night, maybe around 10. The restaurant is a byo and there was a large party of girls behind us.  They were very very loud, but really nothing for which you could blame the restaurant.  I can't wait to go back.\n\nBYO\noutdoor seating\ndelivers"

First order the waitress forgot my order while everyone at my table had theirs. The sushi has toooooo much rice. I only order a few things but I was too full from all the rice.  The quality of sushi? uhh most sushi places in the city are okay, I love how everyone is like, this place has the best sushi place or the freshest fish... but seriously unless you are going to morimoto or zama, you probably aren't getting the creme of the crop sushi. That being said, the items offered for the all you can eat is very limited. There weren't many special rolls offered and if there were, there were far from special.\n\nThere was a 30-minute span of when our vase of water was empty. Seeing how we had a group of 7 and all you can eat sushi/ soy sauce can make you thirsty, the waitress should at least knowledge to give us water. Every other all you can eat sushi places have hastily refilled our water. When we asked to split the check for each person, the waitress looked all bitchy. Well that's what you get for shit service.\n\nSo I ended spending $36 for awful sushi with too much rice... the rice wasn't even good, some of it was not even cooked thoroughly. With $36 I could have a delicious  meal at yakitori along with some imported beer during happy hour or their specials."
