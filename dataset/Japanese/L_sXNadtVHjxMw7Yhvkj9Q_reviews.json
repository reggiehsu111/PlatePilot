Glad we did...\n\nExcellent service & friendly staff. Waitress helped my wife take off her jacket as her hands were full with our baby, as I was tied up with the 3yr old.\n\nI had Chicken Katsu Curry Ramen, Sister had Shrimp Katsu Ramen & Wife had Shoyu Ramen. Everything was excellent, I loved mine. Curry soup was tasty &I the fried chicken was done just right. Same for my sisters shrimp, fried just right with good quality shrimp. My wife lived her Shoyu Ramen.\n\nWe also got the pork buns which were excellent, but not your traditional porkbun. \n\nGreat, great experience."

I will say my curry katsu ramen was the best I've ever had and i just had Nom Noms ramen the day before. The staff was awesome and attentive.  I even booked my bday party here for next month. 100%/100%\n\nIn addition, the Kustu was crispy and the broth for my curry ramen was light and not over powerd by salts. The eggs were perfect again I just had nom noms the day before , and my 3 eggs from nom noms were cold.\n\nSo out of  our table group of four, 3 guest gives Naoki 10/10  and 1 guest gives it 6/10. \n\nMy background is in Asian culinary arts and hospitality."

As we walked in, they were putting up a sign saying that for students with a government issued ID; food was 10% off. I of course just happened to have my campus ID card and they were only too happy to let me use it. Then came the menu. It's a bit sparse, but that's really what makes the food so affordable and good; it allows for the chef to prepare a dish quickly and to the best of his ability; as well as cut down on excess expenses to keep countless different ingredients in stock. Subsequently, the cost of the food is unreal, it's less than 6 dollars for a full cut of chicken Katsu, which for us came out in a matter of minutes. Not only was it speedy though, but there was just so much of it! The bowl that the ramen came in was huge; and compared to the costs of other nearby restaurants, would have easily cost 15 instead of 10. Overall, I was very happy with the wonderful, bubbly service as well as the quality, cost, and quantity provided ^_^\n\nAlso, the waiter just made the experience much more enjoyable; I don't understand why people would see him as annoying.. Just be a bit more social, eating is a social experience too."

I also had my friends chicken katsu. The chicken is juicy but it was quite oily. Good thing the oil looks fresh. I took a good look at the menu. They have a variety of food, not just ramen. Th ey have rice and udon too. The ambience is nice, I came after lunch so it is quiet. It is clean and spacey. You can bring strollers here if you have children. I will come back again."

The interior is a little spacious and has a lot of seatings which is great for family and groups. Like some reviews, I agree that the broth is not as flavorful and it somehow tastes similar. The noodle itself was a little soggy as well. However, on the positive note, the service was very good, the staffs were very attentive and our food came out fast and hot.

I have  to mention what was being shown on the tv screens, it was animals that were wounded and it was pretty gross because that is not something I want to be watching while I'm eating. The workers there came out from the kitchen and was literally shouting across the room to one another, the atmosphere here was horrible.

Service is good (don't like servers that are too attentive) plus free sodas when you order ramen. The price though didn't match the ramen $10.00 to $11.00 for a bowl of ramen that lacks flavor.

We sat down and one of the staff (not sure he was a manager or owner) asked if we wanted hot green tea or ice water. We asked for hot green tea without knowing the extra charge ($1 each) for it. I felt like we were scammed, but it was kind of our fault for assuming it was free. \n\nWe ordered miso ramen and shoyu with chicken katsu. Chicken katsu(which was good) came in first. So we started eating them and ended up finishing it before shoyu ramen came. The staff kind of yelled at us saying \"you should have waited for the ramen. Chicken katsu is supposed to be on the top of ramen. You ate all of them already!\" Um excuse me? Then why did you bring the katsu out 10 minutes before the ramen? You should serve them at the same time. Or at least let your customer know that the katsu goes on the top of the ramen. \n\nRamen was so-so, but didn't feel welcomed there.

        "text": "I stumbled by this spot yesterday with the intent of getting pho, but I am so glad that I chose to check out the ramen here instead. This must be a new establishment because I did not know about it prior to passing by yesterday, and apparently not a lot of other people know about it either considering I was the only customer in the entire restaurant for a solid hour yesterday evening. The selfish side of me wants to keep this place on the low, but I will do my civic duty as a Yelper and tell the whole world about how awesome this place is because Naoki Ramen truly deserves a 5 star review. \n\nI started off with 2 pork buns as an appetizer. These pork buns were phenomenal. A lot of ramen places do not get the pork buns right (the pork is either too dry or the texture of the fluffy buns is off), but this place hit the nail on the spot. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the fluffy buns were actually fluffy, as the name implies. For my ramen, I chose to go with the Spicy Akamaru Ramen which came with 3 pieces of pork, an egg, naruto, and all the other toppings for just $12.95! I personally thought that this was a great deal given that other ramen places always try to pick at your wallet by offering minimal toppings so that you have to order extra toppings on the side. In this case, I did not have to order any extra toppings because they were plentiful to begin with. Furthermore, the portions here are huge. I can usually inhale an entire bowl of ramen in one sitting, but I had to take half of mine home last night. The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture, and the broth was spicy and had a lot of flavor. If you love spicy food, I highly recommend the Spicy Akamaru Ramen. Usually after eating ramen at other locations, I tend to feel greasy and bloated, but I did not feel this way last night after eating the ramen here, which was a major plus in my book. \n\nAside from the delicious food with fair prices and large portions, service was quick and friendly. Not to mention, the restaurant itself is very spacious and open with lots of seating. The interior is embellished with a lot of Japanese-themed decor, giving the restaurant an authentic Japanese feel. For drinks, this place offers a variety of Japanese sodas, along with hot tea and regular coke products (no alcoholic beverages here). So, if you're ever craving ramen, definitely give these guys a try."

I noticed that a lot of reviews compare this place to its neighbor, Terakawa, and having been to both, I can say that they both offer a different experience. What I like about Naoki, which you just can't get next door, is a much more relaxed vibe and way more comfortable seats! We didn't have to wait 30 minutes and honestly, the octopus balls here are actually better (bigger chunks of octopus and you get 5). Naoki offers specially ramens like curry, kim chee, and Dan Dan ramen, which are all really good. Prices are on point and you never feel rushed to give up your seat. The ramen wasn't too salty, which some might equate to bland, but I feel they achieved a nice balance between flavor and seasoning. I hope they stay because I like having ramen options in Chinatown."

I tried to taste it but when I did I almost threw up. It was the worst ramen dish I've ever had in my life. Possibly the nastiest meal I ever tasted because of the disgusting pungent smell of  pig shit. It smelled like shit... and the broth was cloudy as if it they just threw in a Bouillon to give the porky broth a taste. The should inform people that the broth is cooked with pork for those who can't eat it. I love pork but this wasn't fresh at all. \n\nThe fried rice was dry and flavorless. The rice tastes like it was precooked so they threw it back in the pan and reheated it because it had that hard texture like it was leftover fried rice. I didn't bother eating that either because the pork they used for the soup broth was used for the rice and I was at the point of puking. That taste was stuck in my Mouth for hours.

I would have preferred more traditional ramen vegetables, or something with flavor. Plus they forgot the advertised corn. \n\nI agree with other reviewers about the eggs - they could have been softer. I think it is the intense marinade making them too tough.\n\nNote: I ordered online, probably easier to customize in person. Will definitely keep ordering and check out the place some time."

Much better than what we've had at Kungfu Tea and others.\n\nThe service seemed decent, though when we arrived, the waiter asked if I wanted hot tea or water (i was under the impression that meant that both were complimentary, which is not the case.) the hot tea is $1 which isn't a problem but it seemed a little deceiving. I didn't even end up drinking the tea. \nHe also just kinda threw the bill at us when we weren't ready for it.\n\nThey do accept credit cards and have a choice of cool Japenese soft drinks.

Place was pretty empty when my bf and I walked in, and we were kind of worried that the lack of customers was due to the quality of the food, but after eating there I'm pretty sure its because this place just recently opened. To my surprise their ramen is just as good as Terakawa, and they have a special that is a shoyu or curry ramen with chicken katsu for about 11$, thats practically the price of a bowl of ramen at Terakawa. The portions are generous and I really feel like I got the best bang for my buck, especially because everything was delicious, and we walked out of there full and happy. This is definitely my new ramen joint from now on! \n\nPs: have no idea what the previous ppl are complaining about customer service for, the place is a ghost town and we were one of 3 ppl eating there and the waiter was attentive since there wasn't that many people."

(see my review for Tarakawa for more info). \n\nThe noddles at Naomi are amazing, just as good as Tarakawa if not better. The customer service is great, and they have a loyal customer punch card that keeps you coming back. There really isn't much to say because it's just that amazing.

It didn't make it enjoyable and that's my favorite part of the dish besides all the noodle broth slurping. The broth was also lacking in depth.

We each tried a different bowl at Naoki and were equally pleased with the results! The broth which was cooking for at least two days was extremely well seasoned and delightful. The Hakata ramen was my favorite. The noodles were cooked in traditional style and the toppings were delicious with the bok choy, seaweed, scallions and roast pork. The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly and delicious. Seriously, this is authentic, yummy ramen. They even can accommodate vegetarians if you ask for it. They offer a curried spicy ramen which is also quite tasty and some delicious chicken tenders which was quite the surprise. The service was extremely fast and quite attentive. Also, this is a BYOB with no service fee!! Next time you're in the mood for some ramen and want to support a local business, Naoki is where it's at!"

My sister and I went on grand opening day hoping to find that Naoki would be better than Rai Rai was. When this spot was Rai Rai Ramen we also went to the grand opening and was pleasantly surprised. However, they quickly spiraled downwards a few months later. \n\nSadly Rai Rai was way better than Naoki currently is. They spruced up the decor by slapping on a few wall decals and wooden bamboo walls, and cut down the menu significantly. We were told to wait 5 minutes when a table that seats 4 opened up. Then a server asked if we minded sharing a table with another couple. Sure, no problem. Except we would be literally sitting at one table.... either across from or next to a complete stranger bumping elbows. WEIRD. I thought they meant like 2 tables close to each other that seated 2 each... Nope. Then when my sister and I declined, they attempted to seat the couple who came in 10 mins after us first!!!!! After catching their problem they had us seated first. \n\nI don't know if the man running around the restaurant shouting obnoxiously was the manager/owner or just an over enthusiastic server but he comes off quite abrasive. We ordered a chicken katsu (after the guy basically shouted at us to get it) and two tonkatsu ramens both without  mushrooms or bamboo and one with an egg. Fast forward 35-40 mins.... no food yet. We finally get the chicken katsu which by the way they gave us pork, and it was COLD. Not even warm or room temperature, it was COLD. As if it was sitting in the kitchen forever. The pork was so fatty it was basically inedible. Also, our ramen came out at the same time as our appetizer and both had mushrooms and bamboo inside... and one came without the egg that we had asked for. My sister asked for an egg and it came out 10 mins later. ALSO COLD. IT WAS ICE COLD. The broth was virtually tasteless and room temperature not steaming as it should be. The noodles were definitely cooked for too long because they had a waxy taste to them.\n\nOnce the obnoxious server asked how everything was and we just replied....ok.... he had another server come over and ask us what exactly was wrong. We explained and it seemed like she had no idea what to do. We asked for the check and told her we'd go eat somewhere else. I gave her my card and went to the bathroom and upon walking up to the front desk, she handed my card back and said, \"Im not going to charge you.\" I asked her \"are you sure?? I'm sorry!\" and she replied \"yeah, let's leave it at that\". LETS LEAVE IT AT THAT?!??!?! WOW. She should have just apologized. It's not my fault that your food sucks. Not sure why I apologized to her. My sister and I were still hungry after eating their \"food\" that we went somewhere else and ate AGAIN. What a waste of stomach space and calories."

True to what the server said, the shio brith was not too salty, but still had a good richness to it.  It wasn't overpowering with gelatine or fat, though the noodles I got were not the curly egg noodles you'd usually see in ramen, so if you want those be sure to ask to ensure your selection has them.  The service was a bit slow to order and get the check, but from the time I ordered to the time I received my meal was fast...maybe 5-8 minutes.
