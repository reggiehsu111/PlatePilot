Not fried, light and super tasty, a great starter! \nThe unagi sushi was really really good, same for the Margherita roll.\nThe best for the end...the ramen is exquisite! Bold flavors but not greasy or heavy, the pork is super tender, the ramen at the perfect consistency and the broth....simply amazing! \nGreat to have this little gem in Old City!\n\nPS. BYOB, so don't forget your beverages!"

The interior and decorations are really nice and service was good.\n\nWe had an early dinner around 5 and it was pretty empty but filled up as it got closer to 6.\n\nWe ordered two ramen bowls, two sushi rolls, and a vegan poke bowl for four people and were satisfied. The ramen was a great price point ($11) and was pretty good. Thought the flavor of the broth could be richer, but can't beat that price in this area. The sushi rolls were good although I didn't try nigiri or sashimi so didn't get a good feel for the raw fish itself. The vegan poke bowl was unique, the vegan tuna in it could've tricked me if I hadn't known beforehand!\n\nCute spot with good food at a good price!"

It is so rare that you find a place that does all three things so well. The food is top notch! The sushi is fresh with complex flavor: the Tomo and Margarita rolls are not to be missed. The wait staff is attentive and warm which makes Tomo a place you want to come back to time after time. The design of the space is clean, modern, and hip without being off putting and the aquatic life murals on the walls are gorgeous.

A lot of other sushi places I've been to in Philly pack their rolls with a lot of rice and barely any fish, but Tomo does exactly the opposite and that's why we love them so much: you feel like you're getting what you paid for. If you're in the mood for ramen, the tonkotsu broth is creamy and delicious. You honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Looking forward to our next visit!"

The food was all very good, but the prices are very high for what you get - portions were on the very small side (5 small pieces in a \"roll\"). Was most disappointed when at the end there was a giant upcharge on my lunch special for replacing a roll that I was not informed about and made no sense with their pricing structure.

They didn't have seating at time for all of us so we all ate at the bar, a little impersonal but the best we could do.  I ordered the Sirashi bowl with a side of edamami.  Everything was fresh, well presented, the price is comparable to other places.  \n\nOverall, just a solid Japanese restaurant.  I really appreciate the cleanliness and simple atmosphere."

We opted to pick up take out and eat at home.\n\nWhen I picked up the order, I thought the platter looked too small for 2 people - but I was wrong. It was a pretty perfect amount with the addition of the salad on the side. The salad with tofu was so delicious, it mimics the imitation crab meat salads and the flavor was perfect. \n\nI often make veg sushi at home, but Tomo blew me away. The flavors and textures are elevated to a level that I can only hope to inspire me to make at home. It's hard to choose a favorite between the shitake avocado, spicy \"tuna\" and the \"eel\" but if I had to choose - I loved the spicy \"tuna\" for flavor profile and texture. The shitake had a great flavor and texture, much better texture than I make at home haha. Overall I had such a great dinner and I will definitely be returning in the future!\n\nAlso, service was very nice. Alex was very kind and personable on the phone when I placed the order. All around I highly recommend you give them a shot - vegan or not!"

Also service was all right, it may be a mistake but we realized after the order that they never gave us any seasoning toppings for the ramen that we should be accustomed to but we saw someone else get it so that was a little disappointing. \n\nHowever, the sushi was spot on and the fish tasted fresh. It's not some high end sushi spot with omakase or anything but the sushi rice was good, the avocado eel sushi was amazing, presentation was spot on in fact beautiful to say the least. See the photos taken!\nI actually found the skewers to be the most interesting part definitely unique and the mixing of taste for authentic Japanese pickles with sashimi and even lime and such on a skewer is not an easy task and we could say it was a tad pricy but well worth it.\n\nA star off for the loud atmosphere, salty and lack of broth ramen with no condiments, and tad higher prices but I would still recommend and come back if I wanted some good sushi!"

The straw-veggie was sweet but vinegary from the pickled vegetables. The lime sinko reminded me of a sushi key lime pie. It was filled with a creamy avocado and cucumber, which made the lime sinko topping shine. The midori was creamy from the avocado topping and salty from the pickle vegetable filling. The vegan spicy tuna was out of this world! Initially it tastes like a savory sesame taste and then the juicy tomato kicks in. It has a texture very similar to tuna but is it's only thing. The spicy kicks in at the end. \n\nFor $42 of sushi, we weren't full. So we ordered a bowl of vegan miso ramen to share. It was delicious! We loved the noodles, the sweet tofu, the juicy mushrooms and the amazing umami broth! Would love to have a bowl in the winter. \n\nTomo is a culinary experience, definitely a little pricer than expected but worth it. Check them out!"

I like to sit at the bar and watch the chefs dole out their mastery on fish and vegetables alike. Listening to the hipsters go on about the vegan options is annoying a.f., but I certainly can't fault Tomo for their undernourished ramblings.

We arrived right on time for our reservation at 7pm and were ignored while we stood there for at least 5 minutes. Wait staff ran around clearing and setting the tables but no one came over to greet us or ask if we were there to dine. Eventually one waiter came up and asked if we'd been helped, then seemed embarrassed when we said no. We were escorted to a table then waited... and waited ... and waited for menus, water and some kind of attention. Finally, after another apology we got menus, then waited some more - at least 10 minutes, for someone to check to see if we wanted a beverage (we were never asked, nor were we provided with tea). Finally the waiter, noticing our wine bottle, asked if we wanted glasses (um - were we supposed to drink it out of the bottle?) and he paused long enough for us to convince him to take our order.  Our shumai came out cold, there was another long wait for the gyoza, then at least 45 more minutes for our sushi to arrive.  We barely finished and were paying the bill when the waiter hustled over and said, \"Excuse me, but we have someone waiting for your table, their reservation is in 15 minutes.  What????

        "text": "I just went here for vegan restaurant week, and I have to say, I am so impressed. I've been hearing about this place and I should have gone sooner!\n\nFirst off, this is my favorite kind of place--they are an omni restaurant that serves \"regular\" sushi and ramen, but they also have an extensive vegan menu--in fact I think they have a vegan version of 70% of their menu. However, the vegan offerings are so good that I saw plenty of omnivores getting them--including my companion, who came here for tonkotsu ramen, and needed up ordering the vegan bao buns and chao roll as a side.\n\nSecond off, their vegan rolls are seriously a step above. I love regular vegetable rolls--vegetables are delicious! But it was really great to be able to get deluxe rolls of the kind I usually never get the chance to try, and innovative and unusual ones at that. Using marinated eggplant as an alternative/substitute to eel is genius. The texture and slight sweetness work so well as a counterpart to the same flavor profile. (I don't think that's part of their regular menu--seems to be a current specialty item--but it should be).\n\nI don't know what they use for their spicy vegan \"tuna,\" but it tastes surprisingly like fish, without being too fishy (since I don't want to actually eat fish). I guess I would say it had similar notes, while still being its own thing.\n\nMy companion's ramen was silky smooth. The bao buns were fluffy and savory and pleasantly filling.\n\nBut the thing that really put my opinion of Tomo over the top was their attention to detail. Their restaurant presentation is gorgeous (and the rolls are like works of art), but that's true for many nice sushi restaurants. However, I asked to take some of my meal home in a to-go box, and when I got home, I got a really pleasant surprise--they had carefully assembled my food to look like a brand new order instead of leftovers. The remaining rolls were neatly re-arranged, there was a little soy sauce container, and they included a fresh serving of wasabi and pickled ginger. I think there was a little flower, too. Such a nice extra touch."

Very good but a bit too much sauce, just a personal preference. The 'sushi sashimi' entree which you can substitute the tuna roll for anything else paying the price difference so we got spider roll. \nAnd a spicy scallop and an uni hand roll. Ugh, we always order while we're starving..\nEverything was so good hand rolls must be eaten right away or the seaweed softens, and the spicy scallop was generous and so delicious. I don't often find spicy scallop in many places let alone a tasty one. It was fresh and definitely spicy \nThe sushi and sashimi was so fresh(only $40 for the whole platter), my favorite was probably the yellowtail. It was just the perfect amount of butter texture and sweet yet mild flavor. Spider roll was definitely on point, not too much rice which I really appreciate \nDefinitely a must if you're in old city! \nI didn't have any noodle soups or dessert \nAnd it's byob which is a bonus !\nOur server was hella nice but i forget his name, everyone there was nice and friendly which isn't always the case in the food Industry, I know. \nOh, and their green tea is legit, nice roasted barley,green tea flavor."

I appreciate this because the less I touch, the better. \n\nI ordered the tonkatsu ramen and the salmon roll, while my friend ordered the udon. The food came out in 5 minutes. I loved the wooden boards they use to plate their food, it makes something so simple that much more elegant. Although the soup base for my ramen isn't the usual strong flavor that I'm used to, I still enjoyed it. There was a generous amount of noodles and veggies, with an egg and three pieces of pork.

I have only really had eel and avocado before so this was a step up from that! Highly recommended for those who aren't super daring with sushi but are open to a spin on a good favorite. This is taking your basic sushi life up a level! \n\nThe Lime Sinko was delicious! That citrus finish of the lime slice on top was soooo yummy! Highly recommended and in a more mild class of sushi.

This is a BYOB restaurant, no corkage fee. We started our meal with the miso soup -- salty, umami, classic. The edamame is salted and standard. My wife loved the vegan Chao roll (topped with creamy vegan cheese and shiitake in the center). In fact, this is an excellent location for vegetarian or vegan diners including an entire vegan roll menu and vegetarian ramen bowls (although I am not a huge fan of these). I tried the Tomo which easily fell apart and was just average in taste topped with fresh sushi grade tuna. The Rock & Roll was more tasty with eel, avocado, and shrimp. I typically get the standard rolls such as Alaska, Spicy Tuna, Spider, and Dragon rolls which are always fresh and worthwhile. The salmon belly nigiri is also delectable.

This place is one of the few offer vegan options, esp. when it comes to sushi, and for this reason, we visited a couple of times pre-pandemic time. We thought the food was decent, and the service was pleasant. However, our take-out last night had us crossed it off our go-to list completely. We ordered six rolls thinking that would be enough for the four of us not too big eaters: vegan Tomo (8 pcs), vegan green dragon (8), harvest (8), sunset (8), spider (5), and regular Tomo (8) rolls. The wait was ~20 minutes, we were told. It wasn't exactly a warm welcome when we showed up to pick. No greetings or \"I will be with you in just a sec\" ok, it was fine as they were busy, we rationalized. As it turned out, that was the best part of our evening meal. When we unpacked the two small boxes (8.5x5 inch sushi boxes), I was utterly astonished and couldn't believe my eyes that it was $80 worth of rolls! All 45 skinny rolls squeezed tightly in the two boxes, separated by vegan and non-vegan (at least they made an effort to do that). We said to ourselves, \"well, here is our meager ration. We'd better not be hungry\". There stood in front of us are 45, the thinnest rolls with the most meniscus diameters that I have ever seen! If you could even call them \"rolls.\" Curious, I had to take a measurement, and they vary between 0.75 to 0.9 inches in thickness and  ~1 to 1.25 inches in diameters. Ok, fine, let's hope they taste good. I bit into one of the rolls and thought it was something else because it was just a mushy (rice) and tasteless thing. One word that came to mind was \"insult,\" and it's a true insult to all the rice in the world, let alone sushi rice! It was so mushy and watery that I nearly spit it out. The taste wasn't anything exceptional either as I couldn't tell one kind (sunset) apart from another (Tomo). After tasting one of each of the non-vegan kinds, 4-5 total, which is also the same number of bites (as they are just petite in size), I couldn't stomach more. I don't believe I was the only one still hungry after our \"big\" miniature sushi meal! I, or rather, we all have had lousy sushi before, but for the rice to be this unpalatable was the first time! And this would be the last time for us at Tomo, never again!"

The menu is very extensive and, of course, the kitchen open.   The owner, Andy, is behind the sushi counter and both he and his staff could not be more welcoming and gracious.   Beautiful, rustic decor . . . lovely ambience . . . BYO bottle of freezing Pinot Grigio and you'll have a memorable time at this wonderful new neighborhood addition."

Favorites so far have been the Harvest Roll and Strawveggie.  Vegan spicy tuna is amazing too!!  \n\nDeliveries arrive promptly and correctly every time in my experience so far (only twice).

The additional frustration was the single use chopsticks they provided were warped so having to maneuver a loosely packed roll with uneven chop sticks was cumbersome. \n\nThe ramen also was not tasty. I was expecting more flavor but just tasted like broth without any spice or savory notes. \n\nMaybe we picked the wrong items, maybe we ordered on an off night, but just found the whole experience unexciting."

I ordered the tonkatsu ramen, the shoyu ramen, spicy tuna rolls, and the Steven specialty roll. They also gave us complimentary mochi ice cream for dessert because they had to move us for another party. The ramen portions are generous, broths are rich with flavor, and it's relatively inexpensive for the quality. The rolls were amazing too. I'm usually not a fan of fish but I would eat them again. The mochi was soft and was a good touch after the ramen. They have screens between tables and the staff all wore masks as well.\n\nThe bad - not much to say here except the restaurant felt very cramped and loud. I was seated next to the entrance and they were extremely busy with takeout orders so people would be up against my chair sometimes. \n\nWould definitely recommend."

        "text": "Let me start with the good, I commend them on not making people show their \"vaccination passport\" papers like Royal Izakaya does, because that is fascist, unconstitutional 1943 Germany type behavior, so good for Tomo, boo for Royal. It is also in a great part of town, in Old City and has a nice ambiance. With that being said, I was rather unimpressed with the food, especially with the prices they charge. I got the steamed vegetable gyoza to start. They were extremely mushy, over steamed and soggy. They come with a sauce that is in a plastic container with a top, which feels cheap and lazy. If they can serve the food on glass plates, why not put the sauce in something nice and not throw away plastic? Reminded me of grocery store sushi in that manner. Then I ordered the shitake inari. There were way too many mushrooms (which were too chewy and tasted odd) that fell out as soon as you took a bite. I also ordered a simple acvocado roll, and the ends of the nori did not even connect to make a complete roll. Folks, this is sushi rolling 101!! It's called a roll, not a 3/4 roll. The rice was also a bit soggy. I also ordered the \"Veggie on fire\" sushi. Again, the rice was overcooked and soggy, the rolls fell apart when you picked it up with the chopsticks. The vegetables on top of the rolls were soggy and plopped on in a giant messy mound. They were also topped with fried onions, which I could almost swear were Durkee brand onions people use at Thanksgiving. I am a chef and if I get a great meal out, I will promote the place to no end, but it felt like this was someones first attempt at making sushi for a social media post or something. I have been here twice, and both times I was unimpressed. There are many better and even more affordable sushi spots in Philly."

And I am glad that I waited, because I have to say I wouldn't have been being fair. \n\nWe had to go run some errands and noticed they were open for some outdoor socially distanced seating with heaters - so we decided to go for it. And I am so glad that we did. It was delicious. The staff was amazing. And we felt safe. \n\nWe had 5 rolls between us and some edamame. Each of the rolls were delish. Prices were more than fair for how tasty everything was. The hubby loved the Tomo roll, and I especially loved the naruto sashimi. It was all great, though. Seriously. \n\nGo, enjoy some delicious apps and sushi (we didn't do ramen yet), and tip well. I would be devastated if the neighborhood lost Tomo. We will definitely add this to our take out list, too."

From the large fish mural on the wall with the soft lighting and small touches of green from the plants, it's definitely a comfortable setting to be dining in. Of course that may not be true when it's packed but there was only one other couple there when I went. You could either sit at the bar or there were a variety of other small tables. \n\nWent with the intent of getting ramen but was sucked in by the lunch specials. Ultimately decided on the chirashi bowl that came with a salad for the lunch special cause I'm a sucker for raw fish. The ginger dressing on the salad is just like I remember it, from many other Japanese restaurants and definitely has a comforting feel. The chirashi bowl was delicious. It came with five different kinds of fish and octopus with a healthy side of wasabi and ginger to cleanse the palate.\n\nAlthough I will say the regular menu is a bit heavy on the wallet, I'll definitely be back to try more stuff on the lunch special or the ramen (which was my original intent)."

The Margarita Roll was great (and pretty), and I loved the uniqueness with the lime. I did feel all the rolls were small, making them not worth the price. Lastly, the service was prompt & friendly.

The shumai was better than other shumais I've tried. Didn't smell too rubbery or egg-y. The Steven roll was really delicious. Each bite was heavenly. It was seared to perfection. The chicken ramen was very creamy, but not too much. The shoyu ramen's broth was also very clear and clean. It wasn't too oily and too salty. It was so perfect! The ramen noodles for the chicken and shoyu ramen were different too so that was very interesting (in a good way!)

Admittedly I have had my fair share of pork buns and these definitely come close to the top. I don't know what sauce they put on it but I've never had ones with it before and it's absolutely bomb. For my meal I went with the mayu tonkatsu ramen and added their spicy sauce. I really enjoyed it. My only gripe would be I wish there was more burnt garlic flavor, but otherwise no complaints. Sushi is not really my thing, but the three other people I was with got a whole bunch of things and they were very happy with it. My one friend gets sushi literally everywhere and said this was some of the best he has had. I did try the tuna guacamole.
