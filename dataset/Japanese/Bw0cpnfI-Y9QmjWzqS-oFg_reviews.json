He explained everything in an upbeat fashion and his recommendations were stellar. \n\nWe got various sushi dishes such as the Rainbow Roll, Passyunk Roll, Spicy Tuna and California Roll. Which was the best Sushi I had in the city to this point. We will be returning soon to try different offerings."

        "text": "Let me start out by saying that I am a nut for good sushi. Out of probably 200 sushi bars I have been to, there are only 9 places in the world that I have been to that meet my criteria to be called a \"good\" sushi bar. Three are in Japan, 2 are in Los Angeles, 1 is in San Francisco, 2 are in New York, and then there's this place in sh*tty old Philadelphia, a 5 minute cab ride from my apartment in Center city. Izumi is nothing short of excellent in every way.\nAny good food starts out with good ingredients. Making good traditional sushi is very simple: use good quality rice, prepared properly, excellent fish, and a dab of some good home-made \"wasabi\". Most places suck at all or some of these things. Not this place.\nSmall restaurant with maybe 4 staffers including one in the front-of-house. Hardest working people in the restaurant industry, those FOH guys. Probably only 30-35 seats, but when the place is full, they are running around like crazy, serving food, taking orders, busing tables, and seating new parties. The wait can be long, but it is worth it.\nAll of the fish I have had there (virtually every fish on the menu) has been perfect as sashimi and sushi, and their maki rolls are good as well. Special shout-outs for the tuna, salmon, super-white tuna (don't eat too much because of high wax content and digestive issues), and the oh toro. All are excellent in texture, quality, taste, and preparation. If you like spicy tuna rolls, you won't eat them again at your local neighborhood sushi joint. Each order is prepared individually from a filet of tuna scraped with a spoon. There's no giant tub of tuna scraps in the back mixed with mayo and a little sririacha served all day. \n\nThe good food doesn't stop at the sushi, though. Their slow roasted beef shortrib is nothing short of \"oh-my-goodness this is amazing\".\n\nWe first visited Izumi by accident about 2 or 3 months ago, and now find ourselves there once a week. It's that good."

When paying $13 for a roll I expect it to be much more hearty in size than an appetizer type roll that is more like a side dish than an entree.  The sea weed salad was nasty - although I felt like the waiter prepared us for the - others must have complained. The ginger chicken took a long time to cook but I am not sure why as when it came out it was still pink.  The flavor was ok but for $21 I would have expected to get more than an appetizer size portion of chicken. It was accompanied by a risotto which was flavored as salt. The saltiness was so overpowering that you couldn't taste anything else.  As someone who lived in Japan for four years and studied the language and culture for eleven I was underwhelmed by izumi."

I came here with three other people and we were able to get a reservation just a few hours beforehand (although it was a very cold night, so maybe it was an unpopular night for that reason). I'm pretty picky about sushi (and my boyfriend is even pickier) and we both loved it. The rock shrimp tempura was outstandingly fresh with a mild wasabi sauce and melt-in-your-mouth shrimp. The Izumi roll, scallops, and sashimi sampler were all great, although I've had slightly better tuna at other restaurants. Don't skip dessert here! The \"un donut\" dessert was unexpectedly delicious--almost like a cider donut, served fresh, hot, and crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. Considering the portion sizes you get in a typical sushi restaurant, I thought they were quite generous (the veggie tempura is a meal in itself).\n\nIt was a slow night at the restaurant and service was a bit slow (I think there was only one waiter), so I could see how that could be a problem when they are very busy. But, it wasn't enough of an issue to knock a star off."

The food was in particular outstanding!\n\nWe started with their daily special - baby octopi in a sesame aoili - delicious! Tender, bright red baby octopi with a sumptious taste of raw octopi and sesame oil.\n\nThen we had the sashimi sampler off the regular menu; I must say we quite enjoyed the grilled squid, tako, salmon, something else my coworker enjoyed and some very delicious white fish with a fantastic taste and texture we didn't recognize.  \n\nWe had the special maki roll - tuna & tobiko inside; crab outside - delicious!  They did not skimp on the tuna nor the real crab meat.\n\nHmmm... then we finished with a small plate of sushi which I must say was outstanding.  The fish tasted and felt fresh, tender & moist.  The accompanying spicy tuna roll was very very good; more tuna with a light kick than the standard unrecognizable super spicy mostly sauce spicy tuna you find at some places.  I'm not a fan of spicy anything roll because of this, but Izumi definitely put spicy tuna rolls back on my mind!"

Second, it's a nice atmosphere and somewhat upscale, which is not always the case with byob's. \n\nWe went with a big group of seven and were struggling about how much to order, what to pick etc. Our waiter gave us a couple typical options, then offered to just select dishes for us and course it out - he promised to be fair with portions/prices, which I was pretty skeptical about, but it turned out amazing. He brought a sashimi appetizer, gyoza, tuna with avocado & ponzu sauce (EXCELLENT), a selection of maki (there was a special monster roll with soft shell crab on top that was great), then finally a selection of sashimi. It's not exactly what we would've ordered had we just done it ourselves, but everything was delicious and we each ended up paying around $25. Not tons of food, but definitely enough. \n\nNot bad at all"

        "text": "Last night, the Boy and I ventured down to the Philly Night Market in South Philly and like so many others, once we saw how long the lines were, we decided to find a restaurant to eat at instead, and just enjoy the ambiance. \n\nWe've heard quite a bit about Izumi, and we're always on the lookout for GOOD sushi (not that many choices in this city), and since they were able to seat us right away at the bar, this seemed just perfect!\n\nFlash forward 2 hours and 40 minutes later, we'd consumed roughly 6oz of food apiece. The kitchen had botched our order 3 times; the only way we managed to get any food whatsoever was when our concerned waitress wandered over every 40+ minutes to cock her head to one side and muse \"oh, did you not get your such-and-such yet? I'll go check!\" Only to put the order back in the kitchen's queue, not at the front of the line, where it should have gone. \n\nI take full blame for not standing up for myself and pointing out how ridiculous their multiple errors were. I'm not complainer by nature, but this was beyond any mistake I've seen in a restaurant. At the end of our stay, when the waitress sheepishly informed us that our last dish was \"still cooking....slowly. Do you want to just get your check?\" I told her to just forget it. We then saw them pull a raw piece of meat out of the oven and throw it away. We would have been there for another 45 minutes, at least. \n\nWhat infuriated us the most was the lack of offering to take something off the check, let alone comp the whole dinner. Or at least bring over something as a \"while you're waiting\" apology. I don't feel as though the world owes something to me, but I do believe in restaurant etiquette. The restaurant was crowded, but there wasn't a line out the door - it was just \"normal full\". As the tables around us were efficiently fed and turned over, I resigned myself to leaving a 0% tip (NEVER did that before!) and promised to  never darken their doorway again.\n\nI give this place one star for 2 reasons: 1.) Yelp doesn't let you give zero stars 2.) The food that they did give us (a hastily ordered salmon-and-avocado roll and a spicy tuna roll - not exactly what you go to a destination sushi place to eat - just to have something to chew on!) was actually pretty good. Thanks for a lot of nothing, Izumi. Maybe I'll come back the next time I have a 3+ hour car inspection waiting time."

If that's your thing... ask them to make you an avocado and sweet potato roll with benito flakes. \n\nWhat's really special though is their seaweed salad. This is no average run of the mill seaweek, and nothing like the typical you get at sushi joints. Their seaweed is FRESH and served in mellow vinegar and lemon. Absolutely delicious! Even my apprehensive friend was Wowed and loved it.

I went with someone who is not a big sushi eater, so we tried to select a variety of rolls.  The Remy Roll was by far my favorite.  The white fish was very fresh and tasty.  The other rolls were more standard with mostly cooked ingredients, but were delicious regardless. I loved the atmosphere.  We sat  outside and brought a couple of bottles.

It's true, what can I say, 8 am buzzsaws make me very cantankerous.  I was even more concerned when I read about their plans to put tables around the fountain in the intersection in the warm weather months, as P'unk ave drinkers sometimes tend to forget that people do, in fact, live here and can be a little over boisterous at 2am.  In light of all that, I agreed to try the place out very reluctantly.  I'm really glad I did.\n\nMy boyfriend, one of my friends and I decided to give Izumi a whirl on a warm Friday night about a month ago or so.  They had not yet gotten clearance from the neighborhood association to expand their outside seating to the fountain and the place was packed.  The server who met us at the door cheerfully informed us that there would be an hour wait for seating and that they are a BYOB, but that Paradiso has take out if we wanted to grab a six pack to bring back with us.  She also listed all of the bars along the Ave that would be good places to hang out while we waited and offered to call our cell phones when our table was ready.  Needless to say, Izumi had me at \"Hello\".   Where else can you get such VIP service without actually having to throw money around like you're a high roller?\n\nWe returned home to have a beer and wait for the call, which came pretty quickly with an offer to sit at the counter if we wanted, or to wait the full hour for a table.  We elected to sit at the counter and within mere minutes, we were happily seated with full wine glasses and were enjoying the show of sushi chefs adeptly carving through jewel like pieces of fish.  \n\nNow, I have to admit here that I am not the most adventurous  of sushi eaters and I typically stick to California rolls and veggie rolls.  However, the boyfriend was very excited that they had sea urchin on the menu and he went to town ordering a ton of ala cart sashimi and a few pieces of sushi.  I stuck to my old standby of California roll and tried Izumi's Passyunk Ave Roll, which is shrimp tempura with some kind of spicy crab salad.  What truly impressed me was this, the California roll was less expensive than any of the take out and fast service sushi places throughout the city and it contained REAL CRAB.  With a C, and not a K!   An hour later we were all happily stuffed to the gills and ready for a nap.  I will return to Izumi for sure.  And, now that they do have those fountain side tables set up, I have been happily reassured that they are not creating a neighborhood nuisance, but a charmingly local place that seems to bring a lot of relaxed smiles to the Ave!"

Special monster rolls (my favorite. It is so good that we ordered the second one) \n2. Tuna (in small platter section)\n3. Surf and turf ( this is a special menu and it was awesome!!! It consist of perfectly cooked medium rare wagyu beef and seared scallop) \n4. Seared scallops (in small platter section)\n5. sunomono (good for light appetizer but some may think that it is not that great compared to other alternatives but I still like it) \n6.uni sashimi is awesome. (But if u don't like sashimi then u might want to skip this. Their scent can be strong for those who are not used to uni) \n7. Pan seared scallop (large plate section. I think this menu is good but not great as compared to other menu I just recommended but if u are a scallop fan like I am, you will like this menu too since the scallops are served with mashed taro blended with potato and some vegetable pur\u00e9e which is so good) \n\nHowever, there are some menu which I think is so so:\n1. Passyunk avenue roll\n2. Tuna wasabi salsa\n\nAs for dessert, their chocolate bread pudding served with coconut ice cream is superbbbb.

Aside from the sashimi, maki and special rolls, which were all great, we also ordered fresh uni/sea urchin. It was my first time having it and boy was it good! After hearing stories of others first time experiences eating uni, I'm glad mine was a good one! \n\nThe place has a warm feel to it when walking in, with modern decor and cool lighting under the bar. The staff was very accommodating as well. One thing I really liked was that the server took the time to tell us what each roll or item was after bringing it out. A lot of times I'm left figuring out what was what that I ordered at sushi places. Oh and might I add, it's BYOB:) Will I be back?! You can count on it!"

The Oh Toro and the Amber Jack ( a type of yellowtail) came enveloped in a very fine delicate seasoning and melted like butter in my mouth. We had the Izumi roll which had freshly roasted seaweed that were crisp which enhanced the taste of the fish. The yellowtail and scallion maki rolls were also delicious. \nWe ended of meal with house made green tea ice cream that had just the right amount of bitterness to give it a kick. \nThe fact that it's a BYOB makes it so much more affordable.  I'm definitely going back for more."

We are native Japanese living in California, so probably higher standard than normal, but we could not believe their sushi.  My colleague thinks that they used one day old rice.  Rice was hard and ruined the taste of fish.  We ordered $50 sushi set and for that price, we expected to get something much better."

But when you spend $60 for two people and still have to stop at Wendy's on the way to the movie theater afterward, the tiny amounts of food better be pretty amazing to be worth it. The $25 sashimi platter comes with precisely 15 small and pretty thin but artistically cut slices of 5 kinds of fish. Two were your standard salmon and tuna, and the other three were fluke, mackerel, and something like snapper or yellowtail, I don't quite remember. While the sushi here was marginally better than many less-expensive sushi restaurants, I'm not sure it was worth the price markup. For me, there's a threshold where, once sushi is reasonably good, I care more about being able to get full without breaking the bank over minute improvements in fish quality. \n\nThat being said, the sushi here is pretty tasty (especially the spicy tuna maki and the mackerel sashimi). If you want to impress someone with a fancy sushi place and spend a lot of money in the process (I would guess ~$100 per couple to get full), then this is your place (or Morimoto, I guess). If you just want tasty sushi at a reasonable price, there are plenty of better options in Philly."

When we arrived, there were no tables available, but the young man that greeted us said he could seat us at the sushi bar, which was fine with both of us.  We were lucky enough to have the seats right near where the cooked dishes are done and able to talk to the chef.  Now I have not been eating sushi for very long and I have been less than adventurous with what I have chosen.  Tonight was a bit different.  Along with the selections I usually choose, Philly Roll, California rolls, we tried some other selections suggested by the server.  He was very helpful and able to explain the different dishes and how they are prepared very well.  We made our selections including dishes with eel sauce (eek) and kobe beef (which of course I ordered well).  The eel sauce was yummy, I was surprised.  All of the sushi selections were very delicious.  Getting to the kobe beef dish.  I did order it well, I don't like pink meat.  The chef asked if he could make a suggestion saying that this cut of beef doesn't fare well when cooked in this manner, but assured us if that was what I wanted he would do it.  I decided to throw caution to the wind and told him to cook it the way he thinks it should be done.  I don't think I have ever had a better tasting piece of beef.  It was a while ago, so I don't quite remember what the desserts were, but they were extremely yummy.  We had no leftovers of anything!  I'd like to go back to the service we received.  On this Thursday night the restaurant was full, as was the sushi bar.  There was one server who also served as busboy.  We received the most amazing service!  Not once was he neglectful, he did not fail to fill our water glasses at all times and food was served timely.  What a wonderful experience and I look forward to another visit to Izumi sometime soon!"

Next we tried the Izumi Sashimi Sampler, consisting of the typical sashimi platter options (tuna, fluke, salmon, squid, and clam) with complimentary condiments sitting nicely on top.

I think my main concern is that they don't understand their ingredients.  If you're someone with a dietary restriction, that's a big problem (if you don't have any food allergies, then feel free to ignore my review).  We listed my allergies on our reservation and the chef approached me immediately, which I truly appreciated.  But, then it got weird...he recommended tamari for me despite the fact that I listed a soy allergy (tamari is made from fermented soybeans).  I know that it doesn't always cause reactions for certain people, but I really didn't want to risk it.  He insisted that it would be safe, though, since its \"wheat-free.\"  Huh?  I'm not gluten intolerant, so I was really confused by his statement.  He then advised that I order their spicy tuna, even though I'm fairly certain that's made with mayonnaise (egg is another allergy for me).  I ended up ordering vegetarian rolls just to stay on the safe side and it worked out fine, but the ordering process and meal definitely made me nervous.  This is a great spot if you don't have any limitations, but I can no longer recommend this place if you need detailed information about each dish."

They wouldn't get a second try from me but I'm glad they offered me something different. \n\nOn to the main event. The sushi was extremely fresh and a good portion for the price. My only complaint was the sushi construction. Each piece immediately fell apart when I picked it up. Not a biggie, but not a mark of a top-notch, hallelujah kind of sushi experience either.\n\nI will be back to Izumi for sure.

It does taste fresh eventhough, the Uni is not open/prepared to order. I was told the chef, cleans it beforehand and served to order. (4.75 out of 5)\n\nThe Sweet Shrimp Nigiri was okay, nothing wow...maybe because the rice was a little too hard and sour to my tasting. You get the fried shrimp heads too (3.5 out of 5)\n\nSoft Shell Crab Tempura breading was a little too thick for my tasting; pairing it with mixed mushroom was an interesting touch. It's different. It doesn't harmonize well the soft shell crab. I can see it, the mushroom as a separate side dish/appetizer because it has its own distinct taste. It's good alone. (3 out of 5 as a combo.  However separately; the crab was a 2.25 out of 5, the mushroom was a 3.75 out of 5)\n\nIzumi rolls - It's a little too small for the price. Not sure if that combo works well with each other. Note: I'm bias when it comes to Sushi roll. I'm more of a purist when it's sushi. (2.5 out of 5)\n\nChirashi - Not worth it, as I said before, the rice was too hard and sour for my taste. The little thin cuts of fish weren't really good/fresh. It also lacks presentation. It's just pieces of fish lay on top of rice. Yes, a Chirashi by definition are \"pieces of fish lay on top of rice\", but normally it's better placed with some artist flare. Izumi's Chirashi are just placed on top.  (2.5 out of 5)"

The server was very competent and reasonably friendly. \n\nFor appetizers we had the yellowtail tartar, which had a nice flavor from them charring the top a little, and tasted fresh, but was not really that exciting otherwise.  I am not sure if this is due to the fact that we asked for everything without scallions, because my boyfriend can't eat them. We also got the special baby octopus appetizer. It wasn't bad; it just had a one-dimensional sesame oil flavor. \n\nWe ordered the sushi platter for two and the Izumi roll (crabmeat, eel, cucumber, avocado, sesame seed and nori) and my boyfriend got an extra couple of pieces of ikura (salmon roe). The sushi was decent, but the only thing that stood out to me was the salmon. It tasted really high quality. The rest of the sushi was just okay, and the rice had a little too much vinegar in it. \n\nThank god this place is BYOB!

That being said, I'm always open to trying new sushi restaurants so I was pretty pumped to join my friend for a lovely dinner. Unfortunately, I just wasn't impressed at all. \n\nThings just started off kind of bad. I got there first, and was welcomed by 3 servers who seemed annoyed that we hadn't made a reservation. That's fair, it was a Saturday night and I probably should've thought that through prior to going. They were able to give us a table, which I definitely appreciated, but they informed me that they needed the table for an 8:30 reservation. Uhm, excuse me? That was just so uncalled for because I spent the entire meal checking the time and feeling like I had to rush out. To be fair, that was the only bad part about the service. Every other aspect about that was superb. The servers were unobtrusive, were very prompt about refilling our water and wine glasses, and were really nice too. \n\nFor the prices that they were charging, I expected the food to be out of this world and frankly, it wasn't. The maki roll that I ordered (I think it was the Paradiso roll?) was extremely salty, which is saying a lot since I salt EVERYTHING. The seaweed salad was SUPER fishy, which makes sense since yeah, it's seaweed, but I guess I'm just partial to the regular, not fancy kind. The sushi and sashimi combination dish that we got was infinitely better, but I feel like I could've had that same quality of dish elsewhere for cheaper. The one dish that stood out the most was the rock shrimp tempura with a wasabi aioli. It was PHENOMENAL. It wasn't super greasy and the tempura remained crisp the entire time, despite being tossed in the aioli. I would be tempted to go back again for that alone. \n\nIzumi, I really wanted to like you. It sucks living in South Philly because there isn't any sushi down here at all, and going to Vic's isn't always an option. But your food just isn't worth the price. Sorry :/\n\nOh, and as for all those reservations that made the servers tell us about needing the table for 8:30? The restaurant was half-empty when we left at 8:15."

He very graciously informed us of the differences between \"sushi, sashimi, and maki\" I ordered the Maki (california roll of course) a friend got a salmon roll, another the avocado roll and my date got the duck special... everything was amazing. The Duck was a special it had a wasabi aoli (sp?) and sat on a bed of different types of mushrooms. The Mushrooms alone were to die for. Everything tasted very fresh and our waiter went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. (water and wine refills every few minutes non intrusive and very gracious)\n\nwe sat until closing while finishing our wine and they did not for even a moment make us feel rushed. Upon leaving we apologized for making him wait and his statement was \"think nothing of it it was our pleasure to have you\" .. wow.. hospitality? in PHILLY!? I'm hooked. \n\nThe bill was $45 for 4 people all having their own meals (which were very shareable!) Overall a great bargain, and i'm told they have lunch specials that are very filling for $10-15/ person! \n\nI will definitely return and tell everyone i know. Izumi is an AWESOME find!"

Fancy Special (but still not very big) roll - $12 or more.\n\nI am surprised more people here are not outraged by the prices.  I'm accustomed to spending about $20 on a couple rolls, edamame/miso and feeling full and satisfied.  When I ordered $30 of food and still didn't think it would be enough, I commented that this would probably be some fantastic fish.  The Miso was tasty, but the $5 price has to be a scam.  My 2 pieces of nigiri were about the smallest cuts of fish I've ever had.  They tasted great, but nothing special.  The Izumi roll was also great, but small and $12.\n\nThe vegetable rolls are very small, but more reasonably priced ($4).  My boyfriend ate for much cheaper than I did.\n\nMy guess is that this place is great for bringing a bottle of wine and spending a lot of money on the entrees and more experimental dishes/specials.  (There are a LOT of specials)  I assume that they hike the prices because there are no other sushi options within walking distance.  It seems to me though that more reasonable prices on standard sushi fare (nigiri, sashimi, rolls) would influence more people like me (with a smaller budget) to use their weekly sushi allotment there.  On a lovely Tuesday night at 7, there were several tables open inside and outside.  The food was just fine, but I've eaten similar quality for cheaper.  If the prices were more reasonable I would say 4 stars."

The host was so polite, though, and told us that while he wouldn't be able to provide us with a reservation for that night, he'd really love for us to come back and give them a chance.  I truly appreciated the fact that he didn't just brush us off because they were busy, so we knew we had to take him up on his word.  Izumi really delivered on their promise.  Their standard rolls were very enjoyable and guess what?

The location is sort of out of place, but we decided to give Izumi a try. They have outdoor seating near open archways, which makes me think of Europe or something. The food is expensive, if not too expensive. I mean, I know sushi/Japanese places tend to carry higher-than-average prices, but really some of the prices were just ridiculous. Five dollars for tea? No thank you. Nine for a roll that usually costs me five? It was off-putting for sure, but the food itself was very good. I think next time I'll skip sushi in S. Philly and just take the journey to center city, where my options are wider and considerably cheaper, without sacrificing quality, and gaining more atmosphere. If you live in S.

The portions could be bigger but otherwise it's great. \n\nService 5/5\nNo complaints. Not one. The server I had was very knowledgeable and professional. He accommodated any requests I made. \n\nAmbience 5/5\nHere's why I like this place. It's clean, it's small and most importantly it's intimate. I don't think this place could seat more than 30 people. But there's a value in that. The sushi chefs prepare your meal a mere few feet from you. If you plan on taking your significant other on a date, this is the place. You'll be knocking boots in no time. \n\nFinal thoughts, I need to go back. The only issue you can have is if you have a big party, they physically can't accommodate more than 6 in one table. It's BYO so bring your best (I'd recommend good quality sake!) and the only issue, if any, is that parking is a real pain in South Philly. But that's not a reflection of this place. Go!"

I may return to have the rock shrimp tempura again, and try something from the large plates portion of the menu.  But if I'm craving serious sushi, this won't be my first choice."

After that, Izumi was great from start to finish! We started with the house salad and shared 4 rolls, everything was delicious! Kobe Beef roll was the best because it was so unique. Ended the night with their donuts, perfect! And its BYOB! We will be back again!"

Izumi is small but very cozy and retro. This is the best spot to view East Passyunk Ave and enjoy the warm weather.\n\nThis place is byob. They have specials for dinner. Ben gave us very detailed descriptions of their specials and menu items. We had the octopus salad; this is a must try. Edamame pur\u00e9e, mango, octopus (tender) and some other stuff... Excellent flavor combination. Izumi salad was also very different in flavor but very good. Really enjoyed the fresh unique taste of the salad. The sashimi sampler was great. Small portions that packed a fresh and deli stable taste to your palates. Great starters.\n\nOur main course: Catipillar, dragon and salmon avocado roll. Absolutely amazing. Who knew that this small place would have such fresh and tasty sushi. We added more rolls to our order. Philly roll, spicy salmon and spider roll. The philly roll we asked for regular salmon instead of salmon. I use to hate the philly roll but I am now a new fan of the philly roll. Loved-it... The spicy salmon roll was good but the spider roll was so fresh and hot... I don't even know how to describe the taste. The freshness of the sea and the crispy warm soft shell crab deep fried in tempura was oh so yummy.\n\nI am such a foodie that this place will become my new regular spot. Love love love. This is the place you must find parking and eat at. The best South Philly sushi spot! Our waiter Ben was also very attentive and knowledgable about the different courses we ordered tonight. Dude, you rock in the service area. Fast, polite, knowledgable and welcoming. Thank you for the great service."

The food we had was very good but my main complaint was the server who rattled off all the specials and the prices (seemed weird- it isn't a diner, AKA \"Flo\") and when one of our dishes arrived he announced, \"here is your $25 platter\".....never had that happen..anywhere.  Also when he picked up signed check he opened it up at the table and said oh that's ok.  Good food weird service!  I think they need to up the quantity or lower the prices and get some ideas from Japanese Sushi places in other cities.  If you want a taste it's ok but for dinner not my choice. First time-last time!  I'll keep on going to Center City (15th Street)-that's a real Japanese restaurant."

My gut was always telling me that this place was nothing special, probably mostly because nobody ever talks about it in my foodie circles. \n\nSo we went and it was pretty disappointing.  The portions were small, the flavors ok, and the prices too high.  In addition to some sushi selections and other special rolls we tried a ramen/pork belly special and it was so-so.  The pork belly was tender and delicious but the broth and noodles were not worth more than a couple bucks (the bowl was $16).  \n\nGood place for people stuck in South Philly with a bottle of wine craving sushi; mediocre place for someone with options outside of the neighborhood.  I'm surprised this place gets four stars average on yelp; could be because I was there on a bad night, and/or Philly has low standards for Japanese restaurants....."

        "text": "I really want to love Izumi, but there are too many sushi places that do it better.\n\nFirst, the food. It's good. Not amazing, but good. We ordered: rock shrimp tempura (it was tasty but a bit too much mayo), two rolls (they were all right), seaweed salad, and a special. The seaweed salad is different than the typical; this is a mix of four different types of seaweed in a light dressing. It was lovely, but the portion was tiny. The special was Live Uni, which came to us as slabs of sea urchin meat on top of the hollowed out sea urchin. A+ for presentation, and it was divine.\n\nNow on to the service. We had two servers and a water-pourer in a half-empty restaurant. Despite this, we had to repeatedly ask for water and never got the soda that Boyfriend ordered even though it showed up on the bill. Since we were at the bar and had limited space, I would have expected to receive one part of our meal at a time, but they had no issue piling everything up in front of us all in oversized serving pieces. Awkward.\n\nThe thing that bugged me the most was the uni. It was described as being 5 pieces. We got 4 pieces. So we flagged down one of our many waitstaff, and as we started to ask the question, one of the cooks behind the counter chimed in to inform us that they cut 4 on purpose but it's the same amount of meat. If you're going to charge $25, be honest with what you're going to serve. Could be 4 or 5 depending on how it's cut, but you're getting a whole urchin. Heck, they could have just said, \"We are going to take a sea urchin and gut it and serve it to you, and it is going to look all spiky and totally bad ass.\"\n\nOverall, my experience was OK, and I would go back if I were feeling too lazy to walk somewhere else. I would give some of the other rolls a fair shake."

One crisp summer night, I finally decided to try it. Boy, I'm glad I did!\n\nThere were lots of daily specials, but a wide variety on the regular menu, too. I chose the seaweed salad and a salmon roll. The seaweed came in a rainbow of colors (not the plain, dark green type I was accustomed to) - each with their own flavor. The salmon in the roll was so fresh, it simply melted in my mouth! My friends were each very happy with the meals they chose as well. \n\nWe did dine on the sidewalk by the fountain, which is somewhat of a \"see - and be seen\" location.

And the atmosphere and service as well. All top notch.\n\nI ordered the sashimi sampler to start with. In addition the extremely well presented plate, the server also made sure to introduce each fish on the plate. This is the attention to detail a fine restaurant should have. On that note though, don't be fooled by the $$ rating. This is an expensive place even by the standards of Japanese food.definitely great for special occasions.\n\nI also had the braised beef short ribs and monster roll they had on special (this was a very hungry night). The beef was extremely tender and served over mashed potatoes with a side of tempura onion rings. It was very rich in flavor, which I liked but mat be overpowering to some.\n\nThe monster roll was good too, although I will say that I would not order a specialty roll here again because these kinds of rolls can be found in any old sushi joint. I'd say the fresh sashimi is definitely the main attraction here.\n\nFinally though, I do have one small gripe that keeps me from giving this place 5 stars. It's the disposable wooden chopsticks they place at each table. For the price they are charging and the atmosphere of the restaurant, I would expect a proper set of lacquered chopsticks. This isn't a hole in the wall takeout joint. It's a small detail, but really, I shouldn't have to check for splinters on chopsticks at such a fancy restaurant."

I was really excited as I skimmed through the menu before i arrived...\n\nAs soon as we arrived to the restaurant, we were approached in a kindly matter. Five minutes into enjoying the decor and menu, we were approached by a waiter asking us if we could move to another table fit for 3 people so that they can make room for a table of 6. We did not mind it at first but as they got our \"second\" table ready, they had to move the table sideways so that it looked and felt awkward compared to the rest of the restaurant. To make matters worse, they gave us a stool instead of a real chair to sit on. \n\nThe main waiter was extremely rude in moving our seats around twice! I have never felt so embarrassed and awkward at a restaurant before than that night. Furthermore, I told my friends that this place had good reviews.

After waiting for 40 minutes and getting chilly, we popped our heads in to check and were told it'd be 5-10 more minutes. Twenty minutes later, they called with seats for us at the bar. It took 5-10 minutes to get a glass of water, and perhaps 10 more minutes for a server to take our order. \n\nAll told, we waited an hour to be seated and 15-20 minutes to order. Without a reservation, I can understand an hour wait time--but not when we were told it'd be just 20-25 minutes.

Let me start off by saying that the portions were HUGE.  After the two appetizers I could barely finish my entree.  So yes, $35 was well worth it.  \n\nThe sashimi was so(ooooooooo) good.  Yellowtail, tuna, salmon, fluke and mackerel (which was marinated in a special house sauce) - each piece was better than the next.  I can't wait to go back and order some of my favorite rolls a la carte.\n\nAlso of note was the dessert: a rasberry white chocolate bread pudding with a scoop of white chocolate gelato on top.

If you are interested in trying sashimi, these are great options. They are large plates, so you will likely want to share with someone--unless you have an appetite that just won't quit. \n\nBecause we always seem to go when we are at our hungriest, we get the octopus and/or gyozas. The Pork Gyozas are my favorite appetizer they offer. A nice way to prep for the pending meal. \n\nI have made room for dessert the last two visits and they were not disappointing. The first time I couldn't decide and got all three options: chocolate bread pudding with coconut ice cream, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and the coconut rice pudding. When in doubt, get them all!

We loved it so much, we already made reservations for this Friday to go again!!! \n\nOnly downfall, when you only have 2 people, it's hard to get a table, they usually make you sit at the counter which isn't bad but I normally prefer a table.... I requested a table for this Friday, hopefully we get one!!"

I ordered chutoro earlier and the waiter claimed that they do not have it today. Disappointed by the unavailability of chutoro, I decided to order their kitchen special entree instead. \"Grilled Ribeye\" was their special kitchen entree of the day and man, it was one of the greatest ribeye I have had. The meat was cooked to perfection, tangy sauce on top and the asian slaw on side was the bomb! Seems like this place should be renamed closer to their perfection of kitchen cooking. I will definitely refer and come back to this place mainly not because of their sushi, but for their excellent kitchen entrees. \n\n2/17/2016\nComes here for the second time with my gf for our late valentine dinner. I order the exact Ribeye again. After couple bites, my gf loved the ribeye and quoted that \"the ribeye and its sauce is amazing.\" She had been to Bobby Flay's steak houe down in NJ and said that we don't have to travel all the way to Jersey if we can get an amazing ribeye in philly. The salmon carpaccio is also amazing!"

They have a nice selection of moderately priced sushi as well as more elaborate and creative handrolls as well as tasty appetizers and specials. \n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes the seating indoors feels a little cramped, but that's because it sometimes gets a little crowded, and they are trying to accomodate as many patrons as possible."

First, the restaurant is lying to you about having a \"Kobe beef\" sushi roll. We all know there are only 8 restaurants in the US that actually sell certified Kobe. So, they fact they choose to lie about serving real Kobe beef is disappointing to see. Second, all of the special rolls I tried were just overpowered by sauce that was smothered over the rolls. Waaaay too much. Let the fish shine, no need to hide it drenched in sauce. Lastly, the seaweed salad was downright dreadful. It tasted sour, foul and just dreadful. The doughnut dessert was amazing, but left dissatisfied and disappointed."

Of course the answer, as it is so many times, was to grab a bite to eat and indulge in a few (almost too many) adult beverages with her--our favorite kind of Friday night.\n\nOriginally we were going to go to one of our regular passyunk avenue hipster bars but at the last minute we decided a lovely outdoor dinner at Izumi would be a nice change of pace (plus I'm a sucker for a BYOB).\n\nWe made a reservation through Opentable.com and headed over with one magnum bottle of red and one sparkly bottle of white (for me). Our reservation was for 9pm and the place was packed. We were a few minutes early so we waited on a bench across the street at the ever-so romantic singing fountain. Because I made my reservation through OT they called me when the table was ready just a few minutes later--a nice touch!\n\nI wish I knew the name of our server so that I could write him a personal thank you card for being so fabulous. He answered all of our questions (mostly mine--I was trying to branch out) and was incredibly thorough with his descriptions of what came with what (he knew his stuff!!).\n\nWe ordered: the Beef & Scallion Negimaki and Gyoza Pork Dumpling (small plates) and the $60 Sushi/Sashimi platter (for them) and the Braised Short Rib Entree (for me). If I had to make a complaint about anything it would be that the small plates and entrees came at the same time--for those of us eating 2 hot dishes (ahem--me) it just made it hard to decide which to eat first. In reality though, we would have been there forever had it been in two separate fires.\n\nI think that we would all agree that the Negimaki and Gyoza were good. Tasty. Maybe not what we were expecting exactly, but good nevertheless. I KNOW we would all agree that our entrees were some of the best food we have eaten in a long, long, lonnnnnng time.\n\nMy short rib. Was. SENSATIONAL. Never have I eaten meat that has been so perfectly braised. It literally melted in my mouth. I am dreaming of it now and salivating. WOW. And the mashed potatoes were out of this world. YUM!\n\nI am not a sushi or sashimi or seafood person....but I know--just based on the silence from the other 2/3 of the table--that they were in raw fish heaven. If I do recall there was a comment about \"delicious spicy tuna\" and I definitely remember some \"Mmmm\"ing over Octopus. Overall I would say they were both impressed.\n\nTotal bill with dessert (which I forgot to mention because we ate it so fast) tax and tip: $140 for 3 people.  Needless to say, we are ALL looking forward to our next dinner at Izumi!"

        "text": "Very rarely do sushi restaurants impress because good sushi is simply good fish. Many places try to stand out with creative specialty rolls, but they often try too hard and go overboard. But none of this is the case at Izumi. \n\nWe came in for date night during East Passyunk Restaurant Week, so this review is for that menu. Upon stepping in, there's definitely a very intimate feel with the dim lights, sleek furniture and votive candles. Thankfully, we made a reservation and were seated right away at the bar, which was great because there is zero standing room in this cozy spot (which we overheard someone complain about on the way out). \n\nFor the first course, we chose then crab spring rolls and pork belly starters. The long crab spring rolls were uniquely wrapped in seaweed and then a dough wrapper. They were accompanied by spicy mayo and citrusy avocado sauces. The pork belly was deliciously glazed and flavorful, served atop Japanese risotto that resembled creamy polenta with a couple of sliced mushrooms thrown in. \n\nNext was a sushi sampling that was well-presented and consisted of tuna dressed in a sauce with like zest, a whitefish (I believe) with a black sesame sauce, and salmon with a sweet foam. The first two were delicious and creative without being over-the-top, while I was not a fan of the overly sweet foam on the salmon. We both agreed that the black sesame was our favorite part. \n\nThe third course is a shrimp and asparagus tempura maki roll with lightly seared salmon and wasabi aioli on top. It's not really fancy, but it really exceeded our expectations. The plump shrimp was cooked well, and the asparagus is a nice touch. We were skeptical of the cooked salmon as part of a roll, but it was sooo good! \n\nDessert was a dish of cinnamon sugar donuts and salted caramel dipping sauce. It was kind of an afterthought for me, but it was still good. \n\nThe service was friendly and never too overbearing. We liked watching the steady (and very calm) action at the kitchen. Can't wait to return and try some of their regular menu."

The gyoza themselves were fine, but the amount of detail in the cucumber garnish really enhanced the flavors! For the entrees, in a perfect world, we would have put the ribs on top of the \"Japanese Risotto\" of the chicken dish and sold it off as our own because the two individually were really good. I felt like there was too much of the whipped potato on the short ribs dish and the chicken didn't pack as much flavor as the ribs did.

Four out of the five of us opted out of the RW menu as it seemed like we would get more for our money ordering off the everyday menu. That turned out to be true! Our friend who chose to eat off the RW menu paid the most for her meal and had the least amount of food. Not only was the RW menu disappointing but the service was as well. I understand that it is a busy week but more waiters/waitresses should have been working that evening. There were only two waiters on the floor for the entire restaurant (which was packed). As for the food, I shared the large sashimi plate which had an array of different fish(chef's choice), yellowtail canopy, tuna canopy, salmon/avocado roll and the spicy tuna roll. Everything was amazing! Since the service was so slow, we got offered dessert on the house, which we obviously took advantage of. I got the chocolate bread pudding, roasted banana gelato which was okay but the lychee creme brule' was where it was at!!! I should have listened to the waiter and ordered that slice of heaven.

I eventually decided Izumi was all of those things, plus sushi is E's favourite and I've been craving it lately. When I called first they were on vacation for a week, so i waited patiently for them to reopen and booked a table for the next night.\n\nWe considered asking for an omakase but I decided I wasn't hungry enough for it. We each selected a few rolls, a few types of sushi, and miso soup plus a special crab spring roll to start. The spring roll was delicious, packed with tons of crab and perfectly seasoned. I almost wished it had a little more wrapper- there was one thin layer holding it all together and I wished for a bit more of a crunch on the outside, but I'm gluten-intolerant and shouldn't have eaten it anyways, so my tummy was glad there wasn't much wrapper. The miso soup was overly salty to the point I couldn't eat it, and I love salty so that says something. Minus one point for screwing this up and charging $5 for it.\n\nI couldn't have been more pleased with my selections. The yellowtail scallion roll, always my favourite, was perfect. The salmon roll, however, was even better! The salmon was melt-in-your mouth and tasted so fresh, plus there was a lot of it. No rice-heavy rolls here. I also indulged in a few pieces of E's Tuna on Top roll, shrimp tempura inside with spicy tune and crunchies on top. I'm not usually huge on spicy sushi, the mayo/mushy aspect of it usually grosses me out, but this was delicious. I also got an order of yellowtail sushi after being told that the fatty tuna was only available on the weekends. The fish was phenomenal, and I thought it was perfectly portioned to be one bite, but there was wasabi hiding under the fish and I hate wasabi. Ruined it a bit for me, but once I was already halfway through chewing.\n\nE also got a rainbow roll and two orders of sushi and ate every bit. We were stuffed to the brim by the end of this feast! The bill was $74 including tax, which isn't half bad for such good quality sushi. Service was attentive (although I had to ask for water refills) and decor was very nice. It did get a bit loud, since the space is pretty tiny. We'll be back, but I think I like Zama just a bit better."

Yes they have staples like dragon rolls and their own specialty rolls like the monster roll we got, but they're sooo overpriced. Any roll that isn't a California or spicy tuna (also over at $8/$9) is $14/$15. Maybe that's to make up for no liquor sales or the higher rent in that area but they're nothing special for that price point. \nThe servers were nice, both the host and waiter were polite and answered questions and checked in on our table several times. \nFood came out relatively quickly after we ordered them. \nI definitely reccomend ordering their specials if they have have them so you can have a somewhat unique experience. Otherwise any sushi takeout would be able to give you what Izumi has to offer on their menu (edamame, sad sashimi pieces, and I had to order off-menu Bc I wanted hand rolls and they didn't make them) but they were accomodating none the less."

First we had to wait 30 minutes for our reservation because they had \"people at our table who come here often so we can't kick them out\". They told us to wait at Paradiso until our table was ready. We were not going to walk in the snow to another restaurant so we told them we would sit at a vacant table until ours was ready. Then at dinner, the waiter had no clue who ordered what, continually asking us what didn't come out and who ordered what. Everything came out bit by bit. Then to top it all off, the owner/chef came out at the end of the meal upset with us because we were complaining about the service. He said \"I heard you saying you weren't coming back after tonight so why I should do anything to for you\". He obviously doesn't care about keeping any customers. Don't come to Izumi!!"

I had reservations for Friday night, unexpectedly we were seated at the sushi counter because they were full, not what I expected with a reservation. I was then given a dirty wine glass which was also disappointing. Finally we received a menu and then I remembered how small their menu is, a place like Doma or Sakura has a much more extensive menu. When the sushi actually arrived it was decent, not great, just decent. I really would like some competition in the area because Izumi is decent for passyunk but definitely not a great sushi restaurant as compared to most others in Philadelphia."

(+)total bonus\n\n3)no edamame???! no agadashi dofu (- -) : ( \n\n4) no sake (-) thumbs down for that.\nbut thumbs up to you if you have the planning and foresight to purchase your own bottle beforehand and bring it byo style. \nit was sunday and we decided last minute to eat there, so we went dry.\n\n4) but not too dry... thanks to large green glasses of iced tea!\nstrong green cold and refreshing.+\n\n5) the music was kinda corn ball. like asian fusion lounge 1995.(-)\n\n6) but the view of p'unk ave, the people watching, the pretty interior and the nice breezy openness of the space made up for it.+\n\n7) the sushi, sashimi and maki were all superior.\nsimple clean and handsome. + i liked the fact that they stuck to the basics and didn't have too many wacky rolls like \" the surfer on acid roll\" with ham and cheese and tempura fried whatevers. +\n\n8) ++++ for great service.\n\ni think that's 10+ vs. 4-\ni'll totally be back."

The quality was good but the portion sizes were ridiculously small. The rolls varied in size, some of the more expensive specialty ones being smaller. The duck confit and foie gras dumplings were flavorful but kind of muddy consistency. Unfortunately over rated. Our bill was over $80 for three people and we pretty much chalked it up to an appetizer course."

The lime tofu sauce with the tuna and the octopus (or squid, cant remember) was so delicious. Miso was a hit. Salad was ok. Beef Negamaki and its accompanying side was yummy. The Live Scallop app was superb. \nAfter two bottles and the first round of food, we wanted more. \nWe ran out for two more bottles of wine and reordered the sashimi sampler and few other favorites and added on the Paridisio Roll, and it was spectacular!! \nAll in all, in was wonderful and our faux-Japanese server was adorable. \nToo expensive to go every week, but we will definitely be back, within the month"

We stared in torture at the sushi we ordered just sitting so deliciously on the counter. You would think that such a small restaurant such as this would be easy to maintain, but apparently it wasn't for these servers and they weren't even packed. Ha!\n\nBefore our drool almost hit the table, we finally got our sushi...*hallelujah*\n\n**drumroll**\n\nThe sushi rolls were nothing spectacular. *womp*womp* If you ask me, they were bland.

We got a table outside, which puts you very much in a see and be seen spot, so seat yourself accordingly.\n\nIt's BYOB, but we did not, womp womp.  Will have to remember that for next time.\n\nThe three basic maki rolls I got had plenty of fish in them, which was nice, and tasted fine, though not particularly memorable.  Perhaps I should have tried some of the special rolls for that.  There was a disappointing dearth of veggie makis; a well-made veggie tempura roll on the menu would have been nice.\n\nService was friendly and attentive.  Our water glasses were regularly filled without asking.  \n\nThe decor is dark-wood modern-ish with nice place settings and their chopsticks are the better kind, in case that matters to you."

They have a sushi bar ringed with high-top chairs, as well as tables.  The menu is both hot and cold, so there's plenty of options for non-sushi folks.  The sushi is the standout, however, with very fresh ingredients, and expert preparations.  We enjoyed a variety of nigiri and sushi rolls, as well as a few hot appetizers.  Everything was very good, no issues at all.  Reservations are suggested during peak times, as the wait can be lengthy."

The tempura has to be the best I've ever tasted... Not too heavy or oily, and they glazed it with something sweet as a finish. They practically melted in my mouth! And the homemade ginger dressing on the salad was great, as was the addition of avocado to mixed field greens. Unexpected in a Japanese restaurant.  If sushi is your love, three people at my table ordered the caterpillar roll, and they all raved about it!  And for dessert, make sure you get what they call the un-doughnuts.  A play on munchkins with a salted caramel sauce. Delicious!\n\nService was outstanding and very attentive. They were able to answer questions, offer recommendations, and made sure to check in regularly.\n\nA couple of Meh moments...One was the coconut Gelato for dessert. Two of my friends ordered it, and all they got was a micro scoop.  We did complain, and they took it off the bill. Also, my cucumber maki was unmemorable. I have had much better Maki at hole in the wall, cheaper places."

Also had some of the classic sushi, which was super fresh. Sushi is sushi so I can't really go into depth with it lol. \n\nJust a side note : However!!! the guy who was working take out or entrees (tall, white gentleman) wasn't practicing sanitation very well. The kitchen is open and I saw him use his bare hands to swipe his nose a few times and then touched food in the raw right after, fixing the plate. \n\nOverall, great BYOB place for a date! Or just a random outing. Place is super clean (besides that ^) and delicious. Some of the best sushi I've had. Definitely get the sampler!!!"

I heard it was a sushi place which normally i steer away . but there is so  much more then that , i had never had a steak cook so perfectly before and yes i know philly is know so its steak houses, but this just doesn't compare , especially with that sauce that comes with it. the whole time the whole table couldn't stop saying wow this is so yummy! and it also helped that our waiter was super friendly and nice. his name was sun, he was so patient and explained the meals just right! so thank you izumi for giving me such a great dining experiance i will be back!!!!"

I agree with Hayley's review saying that it was a good portion of food for the price.\n\nI thought the duck they made was something spectacular.  It was cooked three ways!  I remember having a piece and thinking \"this is too complex of a flavor for only one cooking method.\"  They didn't tell us exactly how they made it other than it was (1) rendered, (2) seared, (3) roasted.  I would have gladly accepted just one of these.  To do all that to the duck and still have it medium rare and as tender as it tasted was so great.  I can't even rememeber the side.  I know it was great, but my mind keeps running back to that duck and the one fleeting piece I had of it.\n\nSuper great service and a very nice decor.  Such a great little spot for sushi."

The menu selection is extremely limited and the portions are pretty small in comparison to other sushi restaurants we've loved. Two key takeaways ...if you make your reservation on OpenTable later in the evening, be sure to call and find out what time the kitchen closes. Their website seems to be down and their OpenTable profile is not accurate. We made reservations for 9:30 p.m. and immediately felt rushed after arriving as we were told the kitchen was closing at 10:00 p.m. We ordered quickly, and since we were there for our anniversary, the server did bring us a complimentary dessert with a candle, which was extremely thoughtful. What was surprising, and disappointing to hear, the table beside us just finishing their dinner had expressed interest in dessert and the server responded \"Sorry, the kitchen is now closed\" since it was exactly 10:00 p.m. I find that pretty unprofessional on management's part to turn down customers already dining. Additionally, they should not allow reservations past a certain time to be made in order for customers not to feel rushed once they arrive. \nThe food and presentation were good, but the overall experience and value were  pretty disappointing and not ones that would have us rushing back to this particular restaurant. \nAlso- parking is extremely difficult. Their google page mentions valet, however, there was no valet option, only street parking. You might want to give yourself an additional 20-30 minutes on a weekend to find street parking or a parking garage less than a mile walking distance."
