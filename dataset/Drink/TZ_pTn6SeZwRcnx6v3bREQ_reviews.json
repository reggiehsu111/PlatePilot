The young man who took my order was pleasant, but he did need assistance with entering the order into their POS system.  \nI ordered a Mango Green Tea Slush without Milk Foam and a Dragon Fruit with Crystal Pearls and Milk Foam. Both drinks were wrong. The Mango Green Tea Slush had Milk Foam and the Dragonfruit was missing the Crystal Pearls. The Mango was refreshing and sweet, while the Dragon Fruit was a bit flavorless. This is incredibly disappointing since the drinks are $6-7 each. They were running a promotion for BOGO drinks, which was nice. Hopefully they can work out the kinks, but until then, I'll continue to go elsewhere."

I was a big fan of the bubble tea from Tsaocaa, but the first sip proves me WRONG. A little bug is still surviving and struggling in my mouth. In the beginning, I thought, why does this milk foam taste so funny, then I realized there is a bug in my mouth.\n\nAfter I washed my mouth with mouthwash for five times, I contacted the manager of this place. The manager told me there is no way a bug can get into my drink, and their milk foam was made yesterday and kept in the refrigerator overnight, which implies implicitly that the bug was put into the drink by MYSELF. How ridiculous was that!!! Moreover, I am now wondering if it is sanitized to store the milk foam, part of the drink, in the refrigerator overnight? I will call the department of public health of Philadelphia for details. If the department of public health says it is illegal to put the milk foam into the refrigerator overnight, I will report it to them.\n\nI will personally not coming to this place anymore, and I also want to share this piece of experience with you guys.\n\nOverall, here is the takeaways: 1. Be ready to find bugs in your drink, and don't be surprised cause you put it in. 2. Enjoy your overnight fantastic tasting milk foam."

It doesn't come with any of the bubbles/pearls, but I always add some. The location is spacious enough to bring a few friends, and it's an extremely cozy spot. Highly recommend!"

This is my second Tsaocaa location I've tried, and this place is definitely cleaner with nicer service. \n\nSorry, Tsaocaa, although you are not my favorite milk tea place (too watery for my taste), you do win when it comes to fruit tea in the city. \n\nPlus, this location sells freshly made chicken wings, somewhat korean fried chicken style! As in it will take a while for your order to come out because it is freshly fried and smothered in your choice of sauce. Soy garlic was pretty salty but still delicious."

I ordered a chicken sandwich, fries, 5 pack of wings, and a mango green tea. \nThe sandwich was disgusting and after 2 bites I had to throw it out. The mango tea is almost tasteless and the mango bits they leave in there are almost like backwash in a drink. The fries were mushy and disgusting with no good taste. The wings were the best part of the entire meal, edible. They were still very bad, clearly frozen watery chicken. The only thing I thought was genuinely good was the honey garlic sauce, but that doesn't help when everything else isnt worth eating\n\nI never write reviews, but this place was so disgusting I just had to share. If they consistently come out with this garbage it's my hope they close down and make room for a place with edible food. With the prices they charge, you'd be better off going to McDonald's and finding better quality."

The flavor was rich and well balanced, but you can also choose different sugar level based on your preference.\n\nWe ended up ordering more food: chicken sandwich and honey garlic wings (half spicy). The chicken sandwich was so good!!! The buns are so soft and there's a huge piece of juicy chicken in the middle! :D Definitely recommend getting that if you are craving for a bite. The wings are a nice plus. It's crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. Yum.\n\nThere are also many other options on the kitchen menu.

        "text": "One of the best spots to grab a good meal on Main St. I went into Tsaocaa thinking about just getting boba tea (which you obviously should), but was tempted by all the chicken dishes; and I'm glad that I was.\n\nFirst up, the boba tea. I got the King of Milk tea which is one of the best no-fuss milk teas I've had. But that is not the star of th show here. Their milk swirls are a-m-a-z-i-n-g. We tried both the Mango and the Strawberry milk swirls and they were just one of the most unique drinks I've had. There are real bits of strawberries and mangos in there - and they just combine so well with the creamy milk. Make sure you get it with the boba; it just makes it better.\n\nOnto the food - we got the chicken sandwich and some wings. The chicken sandwich is just so flavorful. It is fresh and the thick biroche buns do well to contain all that flavor. It's a must-try. The wings themselves are Korean-style and taste exactly like how you want your Korean fried chicken to taste like. \n\nOh and they also have a frozen yogurt section. It is a separate section and you just get to make your own bowl. I had fun combining the different flavors together. \n\nOverall, though I thought it was just a boba place, this is just so much more. I've never had fried chicken and boba together before and I think I might have developed a new craving. And the best part about this restaurant is all the space. There are nice and quiet spots out at the back where you can get some work done. There is also a TV in the front if you just wanna watch the Eagles play. And the one last thing? They have so many tiny puzzles and Jenga lying all around the restaurant. Yeah, it's just a perfect place to get some good food and spend some time!"

They use different boba than other places, it's clear because they don't artificially color it but the taste is great. It's definitely a bit less sweeter and a bit chewier than most but it didn't bother me at all. Their menu is extensive and you can't quite go wrong. Wether you prefer more fruit based flavors or more traditional milk tea, they have something for everyone. If you love matcha like I do, I highly recommend the matcha tea WITH matcha foam at the top!

(The only other one that I love just as much is Lulu Cafe in West Philly).\n\nNothing I've tried here has disappointed me. The price is a bit on the pricier end, but just like Lulu's, the quality shows. Bonus: They have a stamp card!\n\nThe staff members are incredibly friendly and helpful. When I sat down to study, the staff checked if I needed the WiFi password. When I got their Brown Sugar Milk Tea, but felt I needed to water the sweetness down a bit, they filled up the remainder of my cup with more tea and assured me that it was no problem for them at all. Small things like these add up and go a long way.\n\nIf there's anything I would recommend, it would be more outlets. Tsaocaa is located in a section of town teeming with students (from St Joes and PCOM); I think if they are able to cater more to the needs of students, they'll get even more attention and business loyalty."

In the first three days my girlfriend and I ordered 10 drinks. \nThe milk black tea with brown sugar is my personal favorite. But all the milk teas are great! The fruit teas are super refreshing. The extra hot wings are delicious, wish they were a little crispier though. We will def be coming back for more. I'm actually going to order after I post this review. Try it out you won't regret it."

The honey garlic wings  and regular spicy wings  were juicy and fresh.\n\nDrinks here are delicious especially the Iced mango green tea slush; so refreshing and lightly sweetened.\n\nIf I could order here everyday I would but it's pretty expensive ,however it's still a solid place for delicious wings with wonderful customer service and one of my favorite places for takeout."

There's no need for me to make boba trips to Chinatown anymore. Heads up, some drinks are one size only, so if you're as indecisive as me it will make your life easier."

They make everything to order, ingredients are always top notch, and they're more than capable of moving fast to get your stuff made. Give them a try - and if bubbles aren't your thing, their ice slushes are also crazy good."

My boy accidentally got the boba tea instead of the ice tea slush but said the boba tea was poppin...unique and different with quality food"
