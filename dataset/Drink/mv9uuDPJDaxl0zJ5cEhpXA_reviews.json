Idk how other bubble tea shops do it, but I can order boba from opening to closing. Perhaps Mr. Wish should try cooking boba earlier or the previous evening bc it's a little silly to me that I can't get a bubble tea until noon if I'm there in the morning."

They literally have chopped up fresh fruits and will add to your drinks. Some may not like them, but I find it to be refreshing and maybe a false sense of healthy drink (good thing you can adjust the sugar level and ice). I go into Chinatown often enough, but when they opened Mr.Wish at 11th and Washington Ave a little while ago I was so happy. I have been going to this one for a while and the service has been wonderful. Workers are friendly and efficient; inside the store is clean. I pretty much get few same drinks every time. My all time favourite is their babo drinks (it has a bit of carbonation and the chopped up fruits are delicious). I like their macchiato (aka salt milk foam) drinks, but it's a bit heavy and tastes like cream cheese. In the past I have tried their oolong milk tea and one of their vinegar drinks, both were good, but probably will stick to my favourites. This is a convenient location where you can grab something to eat, shop at the market, and get some drinks!"

I asked for $5 ones back because regardless I wanted to tip her. She doesn't even look and drops the money on the counter even though I had my hand out for my change. I was so disgusted by her attitude. Then after wrapping up her conversation with her friend, she finally acknowledges me and asked what size I wanted, even though I already paid?

Their new policy allows for some customization of their bubble tea (eg the amount of sugar), but the menu is relatively fixed compared to other bubble tea places like Vi Vi, TeaDo, Tu's and other great bubble tea places in Philly that allow you to customize your tea to taste. For example, today, after years of coming here, the server refused to make a plain bubble tea with just tea and bubbles, claiming that she could not serve a tea without the fruit juice. Not only has this been made every single time previously, the young server had attitude and ended up \"calling her manager\" which I'm not sure if she did or not. It wasn't worth it to cause a scene, and I don't believe in paying $5 for a  \"made to order\" drink if it can't be made to order... \n\nThe service recently has been inconsistent at best.

For a store that just specializes in tea drinks, shouldn't most drinks be available to serve without an absurd wait time if it's not crowded.

Last Sunday I was there at 10, the girl tells me bubble teas won't be ready for another 30mins and there's only black tea. Fine. I come today at 10:30, and the girl tells me there's not bubble tea for at least another 30 mins, and that the bubbles take 2 hours to make. I call BS. The wait time for bubble tea should never exceed 15min, especially when the store wasn't even busy. Anyway, whatever the case, if your sign says you're open for business at 10, everything on the menu should be ready upon opening. There should be no reason why only 1% of your menu is ready and the rest takes 2 more hours to prep. If that is the case, then the employees need to be staffed earlier. Management, get your act together!"

I paid $7 for two medium sizes bubble milk teas - SO EXCITING! \nHaving grown up in Hong Kong, I live for bubble tea and have tried a number of places in Chinatown, this place is by far the BEST. \n\nTheir bubbles are exactly how they should be, fresh and not stale like some other places in the city. They also make their drinks fairly quickly and don't add too much sugar. Other places make my stomach feel awful after drinking their bubble tea but this Mr.Wish's doesn't make me want to hurl after I drink it, the tea/milk combo tastes great. The drinks are made fresh as each one is ordered. The regular milk tea with boba is made exactly how it should be, without needing to limit the amount of sugar or boba. \n\nThe location itself is convenient and easy to find as well. Will definitely be returning...more often than I think my wallet can handle."

I feel like there's actually even real bits of mango in there! 100% recommend trying this out. \n\nI know you can adjust the amount of sugar, which is a nice option, but honestly I'm not going here to keep track of my sugar intake :) Zero regrets! I almost missed this place in the shopping center, but glad we made another loop to find it tucked away in the back. So happy to see these popping up all over--also been to the one in Center City and KOP mall, and the products are all consistent.\n\nI will say the crepe cake I tried wasn't great, but doesn't matter.

My friends that go here also experienced the same things; orders made wrong. I've heard from at least 4 people that I know complain about how this place mess up orders frequently. One of them ordered a milk green tea with red bean toppings and they received pearl milk tea with red beans (its a combination of tapioca AND red bean toppings). I once ordered a honey lemon gt and the honey was missing or lack thereof so it was literally the sour lemon taste. Keep in mind we go to mr.wish oftennn so we know what our favorite drinks tasted like. Maybe it's new staffing issue since the people we used to recognize isn't there anymore.

However, I made a last minute switch to a fruit tea based on how good it looked in one of the posters in the store, and while it took a bit longer than expected for our order to come out, it's because of the surprising use of fresh fruit! I also really like that you can adjust the level of sweetness, as I like to be able to taste the tea more than the sweetener."

        "text": "I was in the mood for bubble tea and happened to pass a Mr. Wish location. I figured it was a sign from the universe. \n\nOutside the restaurant there were a few tables for customers to enjoy their drinks. Upon entering (masks are required), the tables were pushed to the back of the store which made for no indoor seating. \n\nThere were large photos of various drinks for sale. It was a tad overwhelming, so I decided to go with a fruit tea with standard boba pearls to compare against Yaa's Fruitea. I decided to order a strawberry fruit tea (with regular boba) and a waffle. I went to the counter to order and the employee behind the counter was distracted. I stood there for a minute and the employees were chaotic and seemed like there was some sort of confusion. Finally the person behind the corner took my order. \n\nWhile I waited for my drink I saw a bunch of people come in and order and a few grub hub drivers pickup orders. After a 5 min wait my order was ready. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see real strawberry in my tea. The waffle was warm and yummy. So why a 3 star rating?  The boba pearls were nowhere as good as Yaa's. They were way too soft and were a little chewy. Additionally the ice was kind of ground a bit too finely. This resulted in ice getting stuck in the straw which was frustrating when drinking my tea. I would suggest keeping ice whole so it would not get caught in the straw. I did appreciate the fact that they give you an option of how much ice you want and amount of sweetness. \n\nThe ice, boba pearls, and chaos at the counter combined led to a 3 star rating. If Mr. Wish can address these issues I would definitely come back and give a higher rating. They are a chain so not sure if all locations have similar issues or just this one.  \n\nThings to know:\n-free WiFi\n-no credit card minimum\n-lots of illustrations of menu items\n-can customize sugar level and amount of ice\n-staff was not rude but come across as not the friendliest"

They particularly excel at the fruit drinks although their Wow milk tea is absolutely WOW as well.\n\nMr Wish standouts:\n- The incredible Apple fruit tea (with black tea)\n- The amazing Passion fruit tea (with black tea)\n- The perfect Wow milk tea\n- Amazing mixed fruit drinks (there are 2 or 3 of them on the menu)\n\nPart of the reason their fruity drinks are so good is that they use real fruit and so the taste is just magnificent whether it's the apple or the passion fruit or the mixed fruit or so many others. The Peach and some other drinks are not as good as those amazing choices.\n\nMy fave location is in Flushing Queens NYC, and it closed down. Mr Wish in Chinatown Philadelphia would not put the toppings we wanted in the drinks we wanted LOL. They reminded me of KFT in that regard. There is no reason on earth not to adjust things the way we want, but whatever. However, this one in South Philly were exceptionally friendly, and are the \"last best Mr Wish still standing\", if you like. It's definitely the best one that is still open, out of the ones I've been to.\n\nOwners and employees had a nice chat with me, and discussed their bubble tea/boba and whether I had enjoyed it. I had.\n\nAnd all that aside, we're talking about one of the best bubble tea shops in the world.
