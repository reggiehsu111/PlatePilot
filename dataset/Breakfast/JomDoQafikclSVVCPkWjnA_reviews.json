        "text": "This is a great late brunch option during the weekends when the big morning rush dies down after 1 pm. Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don't have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don't always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they'll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). \n\nI've ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren't really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The \"onion rings\" made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it's called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It's gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!\n\nThe service is generally pretty attentive (once you're seated), the restaurant and bathrooms are very clean, the food is a good, tasty value"

I can't say enough good things about the service and people.\n\nAs for the food - That's another (good) story.  Ever since our office had their first taste of Cedar Park Cafe's chicken and waffles... I've been hounded by numerous coworkers asking for another order.  This happens on a weekly basis.\n\nAll the waffles were homemade and unbelievably delicious.  The chicken consisted of boneless breast meat with a panko coating and was equally delicious.  They threw in powdered sugar, syrup, and a sweet and spicy sauce for the chicken.  All of it was amazing.  \n\nEverything went.  Quickly.  Collectively, its our office's favorite meal by far.\n\nPlease check this place out.  In a city quickly becoming known for good food - Cedar Park Cafe is killing it."

It's also a bit cramped, not enough where you and your party are on top of each other, but you'd have to be mindful of moving around (or turning and making awkward eye contact). Our server was nice. She didn't check back on us that much until we got our food, at which point she'd come ever 7 min (not complaining). \n\nWe were a little put off by the amount if flies that just seemed to be hovering in the vicinity, not sure if thats just common there or someone left the back door open... but again off putting.\n\nFood wise, I got the chicken and waffles. It was suggested to me by a friend. It's pretty fricken great. The chicken is tender, really well seasoned, generous portion size and boneless (hate looking messy in public places). The waffle was underwhelming in that it was soggy 5 min into the meal, but really the chicken makes up for it. My other friends got the chicken and waffles, and the eggs benedict (it looked like that at least). They were all pretty satisfied (especially the friend who got the chicken and waffles). Curious to see how other breakfast/brunch places on Baltimore ave compare."

We actually hadn't seen our waitress at all and had to ask a different waitress where our food was. People that were seated after us got their food before us. When my pancakes arrived they were extremely cold and when I told the waitress she took them to the kitchen then came back to say : \"what do you want us to do with them like microwave them or remake them im not sure what they can do\" I was honestly so confused because if you as an employee don't know what the kitchen can do then why and how are you working here?? Once my eggs Benedict came they were alright, the bread was extremely hard and it took me awhile to cut through it. My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles which were good. At the end when we asked for our check we waited another 20 minutes for her to come tell us to stand in line and tell her what table we are in order to get the check. Truly an awful experience. I honestly think it was all because of our awful waitress who if I ever come back I will request to not have her."

I was quickly seated and as soon as my friend arrived(I arrived about 10 mins before she did), we were greeted by our waitress with menus. She quickly took our drink orders and was able to answer any question we had about the drinks(I had a couple juice questions). Our coffees came out hot, fresh tasting and quickly(within 5-10 minutes). \n\nSomehow we were so enamored by our conversation that we didn't even think about ordering our food yet. Our waitress was very patient and pleasant even though we hadn't even looked at the food options yet.  We ordered our food the third time she came around and she was very helpful to us while we were putting together our orders and trying to figure out substitutions(we wanted some of everything so it was hard deciding what we wanted to settle for). Our food came out REALLY quickly. I would say in less than 15 minutes. The food was fresh tasting, hot and definitely off the grill/stove(versus microwaved as I've experienced at other places). This was my first time stopping by here and I'm happy to say the staff here and their food definitely left a great first impression on me. I look forward to visiting again soon."

I opted for the fried chicken and waffles and was pleasantly surprised. The chicken has a little heat, and the waffles and syrup provide some sweetness and body to balance it all out. Also, the chicken was very moist and tender and the portion was okay even for a large appetite like mine. \n\nBe prepared to wait, and if you come with a large party, you may need to break up into a few tables unless you're fortunate enough to nab some neighboring tables in the center of the room. \n\nFamily friendly environment that ensures we will be coming back for a while looking forward (as long as there are no more fire mishaps)!!!"

Although we waited for 10 minutes just to get a menu and another 15 to get some water, our food comes out really quickly once the orders went in. So I rate service as average.\n\nThe food was not bad. I had the fried chicken and waffle, which everyone assured me was the best I could order from Cedar Park Cafe. I also got a side of home fries. The fried chicken was well seasoned, breaded white meat (breast, I think). The crunch was good, but overall I prefer Federal Donuts' chicken. The waffle was good, but again, it's hard to mess up waffle, especially when you drown it in butter. The home fries also adequate, but I've had much better at brunch places of the same reputation.\n\nI'm vaguely disappointed in general but perhaps my expectations were too high.

You wait in line and get seated in the order you arrive so keep in mind that you'll be outside on hot or cold days. Unfortunately, the service is not organized properly and if you want coffee, ask for pot, water ask for the jug because the last three times I had to get up and practically get it myself. Its a wait for service to take your order, and to bring your drinks, then other than typical wait for food to come out they are like ghosts. People will sit before you do, order after you do and in some occassions get their food before you. I always get up to pay at the register (and sometimes to find my check) to save time and hope another person doesn't wait too long for the table to get cleaned, which yes you will watch dirty tables and get the urge to just clear it off yourself just so you can sit down."

Located on the very wester edge of University City, Cedar Park Cafe, offers a variety of breakfast and lunch foods at very affordable prices. The veggie home fries are a must try! if you're more interested in a lunch-style dish, I highly recommend the BLT with the house made fries. The fries are seasoned perfectly! If you're planning on going on the weekend, be prepared to wait in line. The wait time varies, as it's mostly based on the weather. If it's a really nice morning, it isn't uncommon to see a line out the door and looping around the front of the building. The food is definitely worth the wait.

No one else came to the table for at least another 20 minutes. Our server arrived (finally), and took our drink orders. She didn't return with our drinks (just two cups of coffee and a glass of water) for about ten minutes. She didn't ask if we were ready to order, which was really strange. We waited another ten minutes for her to come back and ask for our order, and she didn't even know the menu. Okay, she may be new, but having my menu taken away so she could read it herself was unpleasant and, frankly, rude. After she took our order, we waited and waited for what felt like forever. We watched other patrons enter and leave with full before we received our food. I even had to chase her down for coffee refills! She was lazy, inattentive, slow, and unpleasant.

Rest assured, their breakfast selections are good and tastes delicious. I love their home fries, esp with peppers and onions. Their eggs are always done right too (fried, scrambled, or omelette). I also appreciate them having vegetarian and vegan options because it makes it easier coming here with vegetarian or vegan friends. Service is always great! Prompt, efficient, and friendly. The place is spacious, but they always have customers and I have not seen the place slow. Price is pretty good too, usually for breakfast food about $9 and they give you a lot!

Parking can be a challenge (I usually walk there), but you will be able to find a parking within few blocks from the cafe."

I usually come with a small group of people on Sunday mornings and we usually get seated with 15 minutes or less. They are efficient while not being pushy despite having a full hous.\n\nThe food is good for the price. And they have a good variety with verrry generous portions. The chicken and waffle is decent which is one of my favorite breakfast items ever. I also like the corned beef hash and grits. The staff are also pretty accommodating and friendly. For the price I definitely give this place 5 stars."

Our waitress will never know. \n\nThe food was \"meh\". I had the the grits, eggs and salmon platter. The salmon was fried until the flavor was gone leaving only a dry brick in its place. The grits were blessed with a giant glob of butter.\n\nThe Mrs ordered an omelet but made the mistake of assuming all of the ingredients she requested - crazy stuff like cheese - would be included. I guess the chef gets to pick the ones he/she feels like including.\n\nNo plans to return."

When I walked in I immediately was like \"meh, I'm not going to like this as a breakfast/brunch place.\" Boy was I so wrong. \n\nFirst the food is literally 5 stars. I'd sworn off chicken and waffles after being disappointed by lack of flavor in the chicken but this place restored my belief! The chicken was perfectly seasoned n very crispy- to perfection. The waffles were fluffy n the butter was the icing on the cake. \n\nThe BLT- usually I abstain from buying BLTs in public bc I mean, come on u can make that ish at home. But this one was worth it- idk what it was but It was crazy good- I'm sure there was a special sauce or mayo on it. Whatever it was, I'll def get it again. \n\nEven the basic breakfast platters are exceptional. It comes with two eggs (obviously I got over easy) and hash browns but the hash browns are HUGE, filled with onions and bell peppers, and perfectly crispy.  Honestly, aside from the eggs, the hashbrowns stole the show. I got my platter with the salmon steak- which was admittedly \"just ok\" at best but dipped in the egg yolk it worked just fine. \n\nFinally atmosphere - yes today is a cold dreary day but this place is perfectly quaint and calm. The staff are friendly, and the service is respectful and not overbearing. Perfect for anytime of day."

I am not afraid to putt ketchup on my broccoli with this mixture. Anyway maybe one day I will move on to something else on the menu.

They do have pancakes, french toast, and waffles, but they are all listed as sides and require you to build your own plate when wanting one of them to be your main item. This is one of a few knocks, and the reason why I am not giving this 4 or 5 stars. \n\nAnother knock was with the waffle the only fruit they had was bananas. In fact, that's the only fruit they had if you wanted fruit. \n\nThe last knock is the servers seemed a bit harried and not the most attentive, some more so than others.\n\nKnocks aside, the food was real good and the price was good. I had cheese eggs, pancakes, sausage and potatoes. It all tasted great, but the potatoes with the add on of peppers and onions was truly awesome.\n\nMy wife got a waffle, bacon and potatoes. The waffle was great, and thankfully we had fresh strawberries and whipped cream at home.\n\nIf the servers lighten up and the menu expands to be more than an egg focused place, this spot can be great.\n\nAll that said, if you live in this area, you probably won't find much better for your breakfast needs."

The waitress was at my table shortly after. She was very kind and polite. I ordered a cup of coffee, a water, and the chicken and waffles. The waitress brewed a fresh pot of coffee which was nice.  I really enjoyed the chicken and waffles. It had a great outer coating of what seemed like corn flakes and spices, making it crispy on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside. The spices were very tasty in my opinion, however, if you are a person that cannot handle any spice, I would suggest you order something else (or perhaps they can leave the spices out).

But I figured I would give it a 2nd try since it's become such a popular spot. \n\nWe waited 30min for a seat, 10min for the waitress to \"greet\" us- it took us standing up to walk out for her to come over. Then she forgot to bring several different elements of our order out- from coffee and tea to a waffle. \n\nSure it's super cheap, but that's about it's got going for it, and that's if cheap is worth the wait, rudeness and diarrhea you'll have later."

Along with the very homey vibes it gives off, the smell of freshly baked hot cakes is what got us to pay a visit. \n\nThe menu had many options for different brunch items, but what caught our eye was the super affordable prices! A lot of cafes seem super overpriced for their pancakes and egg benedict, but this spot had some really good deals.\n\nThe reason I gave 3 stars was because of how unsatisfied I was about the egg benedict. As much as I love my eggs, this one was just not cutting it. It was way too watery and also felt a little cold. \n\nAside from my displeasure, I really enjoyed the hot cakes and waffles! We got chocolate chip\nwith fruit and whip cream on the side. They actually gave us the whip cream bottle which was both unique but also a little worrisome. We stayed just until it was closing time. \n\nAnother great aspect about this spot is that it gave off the type of vibes I would expect from a Philly spot. I would definitely come again for the hot cakes and homemade fries!"

I go in regularly, because of the location and the fact there's nothing else in the area like this.  If I wait to be seated, I'm told I don't have to wait... when I just sit, I'm told (not in a nice way) to wait until we're told to sit.  Every.  Time.\nAfter you get your food, they're DONE with you.  Forget about a coffee refill, I've never once been offered one, and when I ask for more, it's always been met with annoyance.  Rarely get my check, and have to go up to ask for my check when I pay... which is met with annoyance, \"you don't have your bill?!\"  Umm... no... I didn't even get a coffee refill.  \nAgain, I've been in here a dozen plus times, and whether there's 1 or 50, the service is the same.  Horrible.  \nAnd...

Parking wasn't bad for a busy & beautiful Sat. morning on Baltimore Ave...I know how hectic it can get. We strolled in and waited about 15-20 min. to be seated. It was packed as expected but we came at a good time, so getting a table was no issue.\n\nThe waitress and staff here are very gracious and courteous. Very clean space. I ordered the chicken and waffles. That was the first time I've ever had that for breakfast, anywhere. The chicken is very fresh, with the right amount of crispiness on the outside, and tender on the inside. The portions are very generous for the price (I believe it was around $8.00 or so). The waffles were thick and hearty, with just the right amount of butter, just the way Dee likes 'em!\n\nWhat I really enjoyed the most (aside from the food of course), was the diversity of the customers seated around me, kids, teens, and adults....smiling, laughing and enjoying their meals. I was soaking up that moment, and made me realize how important it is for us as a community to continue going out and supporting our local businesses. Especially the establishments that put out great food and service such as Cedar Park Cafe.\n\nSo yeah, I'm a fan, and will most def be back at some point...for lunch!\n\nLater..."

Not sure what we did to upset the staff, I can only guess it was because we sat at a dirty table (the host told us to seat ourselves), but we sat and waited for over 15 minutes watching people who came in well after us getting menus and service. Another table had to ask their server to help us because we looked so confused and she literally looked at us and shook her head saying it wasn't her table, it was clear she wasn't interested in helping us in the slightest. When I saw the servers audibly arguing about who would get our table, we walked out. I am a server too and I understand if the restaurant is busy, but we were clearly being punished and pushed out of the restaurant by the staff. I'm not going to stick around if the servers have to argue over who gets us and cause a scene making everyone extremely uncomfortable.

The server we had was good, adequate enough. She was standing off to the side not really paying attention when we asked for her to take our check, but this is nothing against her character. Could she have been more alert-- yeah. Could she have been bubblier, yes probably. But she was good.\n\nThe food I had was nothing incredible really. I used to live in Southwest Philly, and Woodland Village makes similar food, for cheaper. I think their platters are $4, in fact. The venue isn't as nice or as clean, but the food is comparable to here.  So of course it was a little disappointing to have eggs, sausage links and a waffle that tasted like something I could make myself at home or get at Woodland Village for around $8. For all that, I may as well have paid an extra few dollars and gone to Sabrina's and had one of their breakfast concoctions.\n\nI finished all my food. I enjoyed the time of day and the atmosphere.

We waited for 15 minutes just to pay our bill because our server just never came back (this was after the brunch crowd slowed down significantly).  \n\nAs for food? Well, either my expectations were too high or they just experienced a very bad day. The waffle was dry and too cakey.

The place is not much to look at but who cares?  It is a true \"greasy spoon\" as far as looks go. And you might have a wee bit of a wait, but it is well worth it.\n\nI ordered corned beef hash, crisp with poached eggs, grits (!), and rye toast.  The hash was perfect, and the grits were the best I have had outside of the Dirty South. I was Soooo delighted and then I got to the eggs.  Uh oh!  The yolks were solid!  That's not gonna work with corned beef hash!\n\nWe got the server's attention, but she was busy with other customers.  So another server who saw that something seemed off, sent a line cook (!) over. I assured him that everything else was great and that I did not want a new plate of food, just some new eggs.  All he asked was how I wanted the eggs (I just need soft yolks and cooked whites at this stage, was my answer) and off he went.  In about 5 minutes or so I had my eggs perfectly done, served by the line cook himself. Our server came over to make sure it all worked out well and I thanked her for the great service. Heck,I have had worse service in an allegedly 5 star restaurant in NYC!  \n\nYou may wonder why 5 stars if my eggs were done wrong.  Well, they earned the full 5 because they handled it so efficiently and without fuss or excuses.  Poached eggs can get overcooked very easily; I won't hold that against them.\n\nNow, here is the best part of all.  Guess how much bruch for two was *with* a 20+% tip?

I had the lox omelet (nova lox, capers, spinach, & red onions) and I added provolone cheese. It came with home fries (potatoes with red and green peppers and red onions) and my choice of toast (I chose potato bread). I also had a side of beef bacon......yup! Beef bacon!!  And a side of sliced avocado. My kids, who are extremely picky about eating in \"urban\" restaurants, totally enjoyed their meals (child 1: steak, eggs, french fries. Child 2: pancakes, eggs, beef bacon, and french fries). The mister, who is close to impossible to please, had grits, corned beef hash, eggs, and potato bread and even he was satisfied!  All in all, we really enjoyed ourselves and I would def recommend it to anyone willing to take the 5min drive, in the other direction."

The decor of the place is no frills and very casual/chill. \n\nI decided on the classic chicken and waffles. The meal came with 2 thickly crusted fried chicken tenders which I loved and was happy I didn't have to deal with bones. The chicken was incredibly well seasoned, tender, crispy and yummy! The waffle was covered in butter and powdered sugar. I wasn't a huge fan of the waffle- It was kind of bland. I ate the waffle with the chicken but couldn't really discern the waffle taste. It was also not as crispy as I would have liked. Also on the plate, there was sweet chili sauce on the side which actually went really well with the chicken. \n\nMy friend ordered some chocolate chip hotcakes (pancakes), which I got to try and MAN, they were delicious! There were tons of chocolate chips and powdered sugar sprinkled on top of the pancakes as well as a dab of butter. It was very chocolate-y, the way I like my chocolate chip pancakes to be and the chocolate just melted in my mouth. The hotcakes themselves were also great- Fluffy, warm and full of buttery goodness. \n\nI also got to try some of my friend's hashbrowns which were so good! They were perfectly crunchy and the potatoes were flavorful. \n\nService was decent and the pricing was very reasonable. I believe every meal on the menu was under $10."

It's more pricey than I thought. I assumed it was a black owned business bc the servers are black but I'm pretty sure it's Asian owned, a side note. the chicken for the waffle is good and seasoned."

Portion sizes are generous.

You have to read the menu carefully because some menu items have lots of included sides (yeah). I went with the Chicken & Waffles w/ blueberries and a side of Canadian bacon (I took a pic but somehow lost it) and my son had the Western Omelette. Big portions were large and the omelette came toast, home fries, and a drink. \n\nThe food was tasty, better than I expected when I first walked in. The waffle came with the blueberries on top, usually a BIG no-no for me (cook the waffle with the fruit inside to release the flavors..please) but the berries were tasty anyway. The also served it with some sweet chile sauce for the chicken, not bad but there is something good about fired chicken with maple syrup . The omelette and portion of home fries were HUGE, too much to finish in one sitting.\n\nOverall not a bad place to eat, and I would go back if I were in the area. More of a good \"greasy spoon\" than a cafe' or diner. If they cleaned up a little, I would give them 4 stars."

BUT the chicken and waffles at this place are insanely delicious!!\n\nI've have my fair share of fried chicken in the south, and this chicken was something special - not exactly better - but a different flavor, and a very tasty flavor at that. And for $7.99 what an extraordinary deal. My one gripe is that this place loads the butter directly onto the waffles and its a LOT of butter - so I guess my advice would be to ask for less when ordering or ask for it on the side.\n\nI also think there is a $10 credit card minimum, helpful to know."

I've been on two separate occasions for breakfast - once with a friend, and once with my kids. Each time, everyone left stuffed, satisfied, and happy. \n\nThe menu runs a good gamut from basic eggs, hot cakes, and bacon to creamed chipped beef on toast points (a personal favorite). There are even pork, beef, OR turkey scrapple offerings. For a tidy little breakfast, expect to pay ~$7, and maybe $12 per person for more sides and fixin's.  (Note that credit/debit cards can only be used on checks of $10+.)  Juices are the bottled kind, and the coffee's fine. Service has been friendly and courteous, timely and arm's length. \n\nThis is a recommended breakfast haunt if in the vicinity (or looking for some good scrapple variety!). \n\nRecommended."

The food came out quick and tasted DELICIOUS.\n\nI like that they had many options for people who do not eat pork (many restaurants under-estimate just how many of us non-pork eaters there are out there).\n\nIt sounds weird, but I am impressed with the fact that we got our food right away.  In 90% of restaurants I've been to, there is an inexplicably large gap in time between our order ticket being submitted and my food getting to me.\n\n My one issue (which is very minor) is I wish the server asked how we found the meal during the half-way point, which is standard practice. But other than that, this place is great.\n\nI would definitely recommend it!"

Only place I regularly tip when I'm just getting takeout. And not for nothing but it's one of the only places I've ever seen in the city that has a truly diverse staff. Everybody kind of gets along. It's reflected in the food. Their chicken and waffle dish is a straight up Black and Asian fusion. Obviously 'Chicken & Waffles' is a southern Black thing but the chicken they serve here with the waffles is a spicy, crispy Chinese chicken.

We had a happy bubbly server, and the food was hot and delicious. My 2nd visit was a to-go. Got a quick breakfast sandwich. Tasted great. No problems.\n\nPrior to my most recent visit, I remembered my niece mentioning that their chicken and waffles were great. I made a mental note to return soon. Last week, I was in the area (well, sort of) for a coat drive that I volunteered at.  I went in around 1:45, and dined alone. Again, my server was friendly and I was seated near the window. I don't know if that window seat was good or bad, because I'm sure passers-by saw me making faces and dancing while I was eating. I'm sure some of you have smiled and danced in your seat while eating good food!

Once we were seated, we waited another 5 minutes to get the menu and then another 10 for someone to take our order.

For example, I ordered home fries & they asked \"onions and peppers?\" like they're a regular part of the dish. However, there's an extra charge for at least one of those (peppers I think?). It's not a ton of $$, but I'd like it if it were more clearly communicated what was included and what was not. Same thing happened with a particular cheese that was offered and chosen for a sandwich; apparently it cost extra but I didn't know that until I saw it on the bill.\n\nHere's the food report card, I use ^ to indicate a half-star and * for a full star.
