Loved the salads , fresh buttery foccacio bread sticks(we asked for extras), and pizzas. Cauliflower pizza was our favourite wood fire taste to it..delicious. loved the deserts, devoured them. Antipasto platter was good first course but they mentioned roasted veggies as part of the dish but only thing roasted was cauliflower there was olives and roasted red pepper seemed out of the can. Nevertheless very tasty and finished the plate . Pasta was decent not outstanding."

Nobody was excited about their food.  Will try again but disappointed to say the least...."

The service was very prompt, with great options for cappuccinos and lattes for brunch as well as creative brunch drinks. I ordered the 24 Bloody Mary and it was light and spicy, perfect. \n\nThe brunch menu looked so good that it was hard to decide! I ended up with the wood oven frittata (so much flavor!) and fianc\u00e9 chose the fig and bacon waffles, such an amazing combination. We are definitely planning on going back for dinner!"

The neighborhood is quiet on the weekends during the day, so it's never terribly busy for brunch and there's cheap parking in a lot right next to the building, which also houses Garces' corporate headquarters.  I always get a kick of the large painting in the lobby, done in a traditional Spanish style, of a cat sitting atop a horse.  As far as the food, can't go wrong with any of the waffle plates (this most recent time my wife had the fresh berries, and I had the fried chicken).  The waffles are cooked perfectly and not too dense / heavy.  Great syrup and home made butter.  Service is very friendly.  \n\nThere s a huge bar, too, so I imagine this would be a great spot to grab a drink or fancy pizza after work during the week."

I have come for lunch and happy hour and when the weather warms up, am dying to have dinner on the patio. It is weirdly laidback and upscale at the same time. \n\nThe menu is limited to some apps, salads, pizza, cheese/meats. To my surprise, one of favorite things on the menu is the verde salad with grilled salmon ($15). You get a very large salad filled with fava beans, avocado, cheese, lemon vinaigrette. So yummy. I NEVER get entr\u00e9e salads, just at 24. I have had the Brussels Caesar which my husband loved. It was just okay to me. The pizzas are yummy as well as the polpette and burrata. Oh and their grilled calamari is delicious. Recently, the kitchen toasted it too much but fixed it quickly. \n\nI like that the happy hour has a mix of drinks and food. Bonus that they bring out a complimentary trio of small snacks (fried chickpeas, stuffed pepper, olives). Really cool spot."

The first course was an antipasto board and let me tell you, it was a sad excuse for an antipasto board. I was looking forward to it most, but it turned out to be dry and bland. There were little cheese balls and olives and I don't even know what else. I can't remember because it was so forgettable. \n\nSecond, I got the verde salad and it was eh. It didn't have enough avocado and it was also way too bitter. I was so excited for the pasta I ordered, but was again...sorely disappointed. The servings were small and it was extremely garlicky. For dessert I got the \"chocolate cake.\" It came out and my friend said, \"is this cake for ants.\" It was a tiny little circle brownie that you can get pre-packaged at Costco. \n\nI would totally understand if this spot had small portions cus the food was decadent and luxurious, but it wasn't at all.  It was nothing special or tasty. \n\nI did like the aesthetic, although casual, it was also modern and chic. It was located, however, in a weird spot attached to a We Work on 24th and Walnut. \n\nIn all, I probs won't be back and 24 has gotta step up their restaurant week game!"

The inside of the restaurant is modern looking, but with exposed pipes and a hipster twist. We were seated by the large windows in a booth overlooking the street. With the warm September light streaming in, it was the perfect brunch atmosphere. \n\nI ordered the 24 Brunch, which consisted of two eggs (any style), potato hash, focaccia bread, and bacon. Though the individual components of the meal was typical diner-brunch fare, the quality of the ingredients was high and relatively affordable ($10.00). The focaccia bread, shaped into sticks, was thick and pillowy with nice herb flavoring and a toasted shell. The eggs were cooked medium-hard, like I'd requested, and the potato hash was solid, but not anything special. In hindsight, I wish that I had ordered my eggs sunny side-up like my friend, so that I could dip the focaccia in the egg. Relative to the rest of the meal, there was a lot of focaccia bread. The portion sizes were substantial, but not generous. What surprised me the most about the meal was the bacon. The bacon wasn't cooked in any special way that I was aware of, but it was delicious. Bacon has a leg up in being delicious, given that its bacon, but this bacon was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. My other friend ordered the mixed berry waffle, which he reported as \"fruit on top of a waffle.\" He enjoyed it, but wouldn't necessarily pay $11.00 to eat it again.\n\nOverall, we had a nice time. The service was very attentive while we were there and the atmosphere was relaxed. I would come back again for the atmosphere and try some of their other brunch foods, such as the pizza, or their regular entrees."

For a Monday night, it was pretty slow but I still opted to sit and have dinner at the bar because the two girls working were so friendly.\n\nI started with the Wild Flower and Above the Clouds cocktails and both were tasty. They are the kind of drinks that go down really quick (especially the Wild Flower with the big ice cubes ) but will sneak up on you after a few.\n\nMy starter was the Brussel Sprout Caesar salad. That dish was just ehhhh - I'd recommend trying a different salad as the dressing was bland. My colleague got the calamari and said it was tasty.\n\nMy main course was the Gnudi ricotta pasta... freaking AMAZING. The portion isn't super big but it's a dense pasta and will fill you up just perfectly. I also tried my friends EGG pizza with truffle oil, mushrooms and onions.  The wood fire taste in the crust with the savory truffle flavor was really interesting. \n\nAll in all, it was a great low key, casual spot with a good vibes only!"

Once we were seated it did take quite a while for our server to come over and she poured us water and then walked away for 5 more minutes (meanwhile, we were definitely ready for drinks from the bar and to order our food). So then she comes back and has a really hard time understanding our order. We were sharing two pizzas (one of the pizzas was the cauliflower and pancetta which we asked for half without pancetta since two people are vegetarian) and we all good our own salads as well. \n\nA few minutes later she came back and asked if we wanted the cauliflower to come out first and then realized she must think we ordered the appetizer which has cauliflower so we corrected her and told the orders again. The salads were good. Two of us had the chopped salad and verde salad.\n\nThe pizzas came and the cauliflower had the pancetta on every slice so it had to be sent back. Once it did come back correct, it was good. Both were decent, nothing great and definitely expensive for a small pizza. Btw, there was no apology at all about the mixup, which bothers me from a customer service perspective. Overall it was an okay experience but I have no plans on returning anytime in the foreseeable future."

The cauliflower was the star in an otherwise lackluster meal. The polenta had no taste. The pizza was the biggest disappointment with undercooked, soggy crust. The restaurant has a similar menu as Barbuzzo and Wm. Mulherin's Sons, but does it much much worse. The pizza is much worse than what you can get at Pizzeria Vetri. I would not go back as for the same price, there are many restaurants with much better food. The ambiance of being in an office building is also very odd."

The pizza is nothing to shout about and definitely not up to the level of the competition in the fancy pizza realm (Pizzeria Vetri or Stella, or Zavino). \n\nThe server was friendly but did not seem to be at the experience level that you would expect from a Garces restaurant. The check ins with the table were ill timed and frequent. \n\nI'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they opened relatively recently. The decor is awesome and I'm a huge fan of any establishment that has happy hour 7 days a week. \n\nHopefully it improves over time."

They do a really nice roasted cauliflower, with a very good dressing. Brussels Caesar is excellent, and you can order it without the pancetta. One complaint from my crowd was that the polenta was watery. That might simply have been the one-off for the meal.\n\nSome very good beers on tap - I had the Troegs IPA, can't go wrong with that, served in a very attractive tall glass.\n\nOne down side is that this place has the potential to be unreasonably loud. The evening I was here, we sat toward the front (entrance) of the restaurant, and it was fine, noise-wise. Quieter there, I think, so you might want to request a table toward the door if you want to have a conversation during hours when the restaurant is packed and very loud. Avoid sitting directly under or close to the speakers.\n\nOutdoor seating is a plus, but it's first come, first served. \n\nAnother thing that's great about this place is that you can look out the window at the Sweat fitness place across the street and think about all the working out you'll need to take off the calories!\n\nWill be back."

She told me it was supposed to be a mix and it must be \"confusing\" for me. Again WHATTTT??!!! Then I showed her the two tiny arugula leaves I found. She told me the cooks must have grabbed a smaller handful of arugula throwing off the arugula to shitty romaine ratio (I'm paraphrasing).

Just awful service.\nWe also had an incident when paying the bill, where the guy seemed confused about multiple payment methods. So he left a pile of $80 cash on the counter, and put the balance on the credit card. So when we asked about it, he pretended he didn't know what to do with cash...So he was just going to leave it by the register?\nI could see if this type of service happened when they were slammed, but there were not many people there. \nNever again."

I ordered the white clam, which didn't measure up to Pepe's in New Haven CT, but was still tasty. The pepperoni pie with red sauce had great flavor, and was my favorite of the two. The pizza would be perfect if the crust was a little crunchier but it errs toward floppy.\n\nOverall, the vibe here is right. I'd definitely return for the atmosphere alone.

I will return and be adventurous with clam pizza next time."

Our first impression was set by the hostess who pretentiously told us there was a 30 minute wait without checking the tables. Since we had walked past some empty ones outside, we asked about them. We were promptly seated after that  But our waitress was really friendly and made up for the hostess. \n\nWe tried the cacio e pepe and pepperoni pizza. Both were good but a little too spicy IMO - and I love spicy food! The service was really quick and we had a great view of the river on the patio. Not sure I'll be back but happy we tried it."

I ordered a Bellini off of the happy hour menu which was awful and requested a different drink. The waiter took my Bellini and gave me the wine I requested but still charged me for the Bellini! Why did he take it away? I didn't ask him to... the pizza was charred and nothing special. Zavino and Pizza Vetri do a better job. Also ordered the meat board and asked which items had beef as I don't eat beef. The waiter said two items had beef and two did not when the board came out 2/3 items had beef in it. Will definitely NOT return and will reconsider before going to other Garces restaurants again"

First  one of the more popular dishes was not available, poor planning on management's behalf. 6ABC featured a special meal deal for brunch this weekend. One would think that management should have ensured all items for the very limited brunch menu was available, but it was not!!! Our server was not the best either. Lacking in the professional appearance category and when my husband asked for salt and pepper he recieved 2 salt grinders. Our server never returned to inquire how the meal was going after our first few bites. \nAll of this and my husband and I were the only ones in the restaurant, so it can not be chalked up to being busy. WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING! \n\nWhy 2 stars you ask... because at least what we were actually able to order did taste good."

We had a bunch but they were all decent. They have mad in house infused drinks that's not on the menu so also ask because you don't know what you might be missing. We had a jalape\u00f1o and mango infused tequila \"something\" and that was Delish. \n\nWe had pizza because our friend raved about it,  Margherita and pepperoni.  They were both great.  If you go during Happy hour it's only $9 which is a great deal.  They also have a great hh selection of other things as well.  Food and drinks- can't get better than that.  \nDuring happy hour they give you a snack w chick peas, olives and kind of a fried ball (I say they crack balls) because omg they are so good.) they're filled w pepperoni, cheese and wrapped in what looks like a cherry pepper then fried.  Holy smokes, they're good. I could order a platter and eat it as a meal.  \nWho ever thought of that, great job.

While our menu was limited to what the company selected, I can vouch for the following:\n\n-Roast red peppers w/ goat cheese and pine nuts were amazing, served with garlic bread strips.\n-Toastinis with crab meat and avocado could have been given to me all night and I would have never complained.  Wow, amazing dish (I had 4!).  I believe they are appetizers (?) or they may simply have been for this specific event.  In either way, try them out if you have the opportunity!\n-Pizza I tried: pepperoni (classic, not too much sauce, slightly singed pepperoni which is the proper way to eat it!), Egg pizza with truffle oil sprinkled over top was AMAZING, Margherita pizza was also pretty good, but not my first choice, Four Cheese which was a great lighter option.  The pizzas served at our party were smaller and I'm not sure if that's the size they are normally - but if so, they are good either as an appetizer or a personal dinner pizza.  They aren't too heavy or overloaded with toppings so you won't leave feeling too full.\n\nAs for the bar - so much room with a few televisions to catch your favorite sports event.  Their beer and wine selection is alright at best, I would like to see some more craft specialties since craft beer and artisan pizzas seem to jive so well.  This is a full-service bar so there are also cocktails available, a little of something for everybody.  \n\nOverall, I'm really excited to head back to this place for a casual dinner.  It's an interesting idea because there is a quick order counter but it's also a full-service restaurant.  I would imagine in the morning you could run in and grab some breakfast and a coffee and be on your way to work, then come in for happy hour at the spacious bar then transition to a table for a sit down meal.  I love the versatility of the space and Garces is usually an great experience. Try this place out!"

We didn't go long waits in between courses. The decor was pretty nice too. It felt like a cozy chic cabin. It had TVs and the kitchen area was open and you can see. \n\nThe bad: the food was underwhelming. I got the calamari (which is not fried), the four cheese pizza, and the pistachio dessert. I really didn't feel like I loved any of it. The calamari was nicely cooked but just really bland. The sauce it was with was good and probably the best part but as soon as my waiter saw I ate the calamari he took the plate with all the delicious sauce. That was bummer. \n\nThe pizza was good except there is absolutely no need to put blue cheese on it. It really made it bitter and frankly inedible. I'm surprised so many people liked it. I can think of ten different cheeses that would have been better than blue cheese for that fourth cheese. \n\nThe dessert and drinks were forgettable. \n\nThe ugly: you know this restaurant is positioned right over the river and that was a big draw for me. However over half the restaurant has little or no view at all. Our view in the booth was of people sweating in the gym next door and various construction cones. My table mate had a view of the offices that were located in the building. That was a hugeeeeee let down. \n\nAll in all: I probably won't be back but you should definitely give it a try at least once."

The restaurant is appropriately named 24.  This is a restaurant literally overlooking the Schuylkill River and University City and I think undoubtedly in warmer weather the outside terrace will be its strongest feature.  For right now in winter, the action is focused inward.  It is a modern open-kitchen space with a large bar area.  I recently stopped in to try the Four Cheese pizza.  The cheeses are Manchego, Mozzarella, Royal Blue Cheese, and Parmesan. It was served on top of a La Valle Tomato Can pedestal.  The pizza was indeed good - especially with the addition of hot pepper.  The crust is a bit on the chewy side and I would def replace the current knives presented with sharper ones.  At times I felt like I was sawing to get through the crust.   Prices are slightly on the higher side (It is a Garces establishment) so Happy Hour is a good deal.   The bar service was very efficient and friendly.  But I'm not sure this place will truly shine until the outdoor deck can be utilized!"

The trio of complimentary nibbles--fried peppadew peppers stuffed with cheese and pepperoni; olives; and fried chickpeas--are a welcome touch, although it would have been nice to get them with our first round of drinks rather than at the end of the meal. And this brings me to the 1.5 yelp deduction: timing and service. The staff we encountered were all friendly and helpful, but would drift to far corners of the large bar area to chat amongst themselves. When staff outnumber patrons yet you're cocktail-less for a decent amount of time, that's a problem. I'll give 24 another shot but given the price point I hope the service kinks get worked out soon.

We looked on the Garces website and saw 24- Italian- and immediately decided to try this. My husband and I came here for my (30th- AH) birthday dinner on Friday and I'm still dreaming of the pizza. We started with the roasted red peppers and calamari. The peppers were delicious and the goat cheese topping added a level of richness and creaminess that was just right. The grilled calamari were perfectly cooked and the spicy red sauce underneath was flavorful and unfamiliar. We asked the server what encompassed this sauce and I believe he said there was ground salami in it. It was really delicious and a unique flavor combination. We decided to try the four cheese pizza with a side of broccoli rabe as well. I'm obsessed with broccoli rabe and this rendition was great, nice and garlic-y with a crunchy breadcrumb topping. The four cheese pizza though, that was the star. Blue cheese on pizza? TRY IT. Utterly decadent and I believe it's also featured on the happy hour menu for $9 so we are planning on coming back and getting it again sometime!

He cleaned the plate. \n\nThe Cauliflower, man I've never seen anything like this in my life. You've got a look at the picture. An entire half a head of cauliflower roasted with just the most delicious yogurt and seasoning tasting sauce around the edge with toasted seeds just cooked to perfection. I had a quarter of it and took the rest home. It was huge. Very unique and tasty. \n\nAs if that wasn't enough we ordered a pepperoni pizza to split. The pepperoni was just perfectly seasoned and really delicious. The pizza was so incredibly light we ate the entire thing between the two of us and didn't feel overly stuffed. Really nicely done with that delicious light char. \n\nThe waiter really twisted our arm (kidding) and got us to split a dessert. It was a really nice chocolate mousse with the marscapone on the top powdered sugar crusted pistachios and raspberries. A tiny size but perfect for a few bites to share at the end of the meal. \n\nThe prices were reasonable and they had a nice full coffee bar should you want that at the end. I really liked the look of this place. There's a huge bar in the back in the shape of a large square that will eventually open out into the fresh air patio once the weather is nice. Super job and kudos to the Garces group for this new addition. It's going to do well."

Atmosphere was nice, though next time we hope to go when it's warmer so we can take advantage of their \"waterfront\" balcony overlooking the Schuylkill River.\n\nIn order from the top of the menu to the bottom, we group-ordered and shared: the South Philly Chopped salad (Romaine, Wood Grilled Peppers, Feta, Soppressata, Chickpeas, Oregano Vinaigrette)--love chickpeas, especially in salads!; the Verde salad (Arugula, Fava Beans, Bianco Sardo, Avocado, Grilled Lemon Vinaigrette); the Calamari ('Nduja, Celery, Lemon); the Polpette (Pork & Beef Meatballs, Gravy, Parmesan)--especially enjoyed the toasted baguette that was served with the meatballs, which was terrific to sop up the gravy with!; Tuna Bolognese (Rigatoni, Tuna & Pancetta Ragu, Whipped Ricotta)--not overpoweringly tuna-y, which I thought was nice, though some diners wished for more tuna; Carbonara (Bucatini, Guanciale, Egg, English Peas)--delicious and very rich, not for the dieters!; Margherita pizza (San Marzano Tomato, Fior di Latte, Basil); Pepperoni pizza (Manchego, Fresh Mozzarella, San Marzano Tomato)--little is better than a good pepperoni pizza, and this was chock full of pepperoni!; Egg pizza (Taleggio, Black Truffle, Wild Mushrooms, Oregano). All the pizzas were perfectly fired, crispy and not burned. All the pastas tasted homemade and were nicely al dente. Overall, it was a lovely meal and we would definitely return for a repeat!"

This review is for the entire experience \n\nI would rate the food here a 4.5/5- the reason is the food here is really good, but that's where it ends. It's not like Vetri or Barbuzzo, where you have \"must tries.\" However, this is a menu where I feel like you can't go wrong. \n\nWe ordered: \n- Verde with Steak (absolutely delicious - the avocados with the fava bean combination really works well) \n- Roasted Cauliflower (this is literally a head of cauliflower - they're not lying) \n- Egg Pizza (This was good, but I just had Barbuzzo's a week ago and it just can't compete. Also, the pizza is very heavy with eggs, mushrooms, and truffles. Ideally having some greens on top or on the side would probably make this dish a lot more enjoyable - I ended up adding the arugula from the salad on top.) \n- Bacio Gelato (SO GOOD, especially with the added caramelized hazelnuts) \n\nThe staff here is definitely more new and inexperienced, but friendly. I give it four stars because it really does have potential. I think it just needs more time. The prices are also extremely reasonable for the quantity."

You get the feeling of an abandoned construction site, or a manufacturing space that has been adorned with modern and sometimes elaborate art work and interesting light fixtures. The whole thing works and although it's not a unique concept, this is one of the few local restaurants to embrace the idea and really make it work well. The service was friendly and the cocktails delicious. I tried the pepperoni pizza, the burrata, and the rabbit agnolotti. The pizza is an oven brick style pizza that's making a comeback to more refined pizza joints. It was pretty tasty. The burrata was fresh but lack excitement in presentation.  The rabbit in the agnolotti was perfect but the sweet and slightly nutty sauce it was paired with was just ok. Overall an alright experience."

Located in the same building as his corporate offices, 24 is a nice and simple place for a bite or a drink.  There is a private room off of the bar and outside tables on the balcony.  Simple pizza dishes and pasta are the mainstay on the menu.  Good wine bar, beer selection, and a full cocktail menu as well.  While this is an informal spot it also has a nice seductive vibe too.  Good spot for an informal date and it is so large, families with little ones don't spoil your dining experience.  It is about a 5 minute walk from Fitler Square, 30th Street Station, and maybe 10 from Rittenhouse Square.  They also have a very generous happy hour priced menu so go early!"

Actually, it may have been too laid back since the slow service had me late for work, but with such delicious food I can't be mad.\n\nI started out with the meatballs. They were served with sauce and toasted bread. These juicy meatballs were a very tasty start to my meal. Then for the entree I was able to share the lamb sausage pizza and the pepperoni pizza. Both were perfectly cooked thin crust masterpieces. Not the typical pepperoni and sausage pizza you get from a pizza shop. Unfortunately, dessert was so forgetable that I can't even remember what I ate. So don't go for the dessert, go for the meatballs and pizza!"

The outside seating overlooks the river and a beautiful view of University City and the skyline. So I made a reservation, grabbed my kid and we landed there this evening.\n\nI really wanted a table on the beautiful outside deck overlooking the river but they were filled. The very kind host seated us inside and said he would keep an eye out for a table outside to open and it would be ours. He kept his promise and before we ordered inside we were escorted outside. I was struck with the beauty. Honestly, the view is incredible. That alone would have been enough...but the food was great too. \n\nI ordered the cherry range cocktail. (Old overholt rye, carpano antica, charred cherry) Very well done and the the charrred cherry (there were three!)...delicious.\n\nWe ordered calamari for the start, the pepperoni with mushroom pie and amatriciana. The calamari was delicious. It was grilled with 'nduja, parsley and lemon. The char from the grill was divine and the 'nduja gave it a kick. The pizza was great. Thin crust with perfect sauce and fresh pepporoni. The amatriciiana was delicious. The pasta was fresh and the sauce was spiced well with just the right flavors. I can't remember what our dessert was called but was pistachio with vanilla chocolate mousse. YUM!\n\nThe servers were great in that when they showed up they were knowledgable and kind...but when they disappeared (we didn't have just one server...there were many..which made ordering more drinks or asking questions difficult) it was hard to get the attention of someone when something was needed for the table. Our pizza was delivered to our table and I wanted to order a beer to drink with my meal. I was already into my third and last slice when I finally asked a random server if it were possible to get a beer with my meal. That is my only complaint. This place is gorgeous and delicious and I will back."

All 4 starter were easily wins:\n\n1. Roasted peppers/goat cheese - roasted red peppers with goat cheese and a vinaigrette\n2. Brussel Sprout Salad - Very tasty, texture is cool, dressing is delicious \n3. Roasted Beets with ricotta - Ricotta was shaved instead of soft\n4. Calamari - Heavy on the parsley/lemon - so good looking.\n\nThen pizza's - again, too many good choices so we each got one.\n\nEasily the Margherita and the Egg were our favorites. \nThe Lamb sausage was good but not very special.

For second course ny friend ordered five cheese pizza and I ordered cauliflower pizza without pork. Cheese pizza was really good however cauliflower pizza had some flavor missing.

I started with a Manhattan-like cocktail (\"cherry\" something or other?) at the bar that I thought was only mediocre, but once we moved to our table, I ordered a glass of house wine that I liked much better. \n\nWe ordered from the Restaurant Week menu, which provided us with tons of food for $35/each. The RW menu started with a tasty antipasti plate and grilled bread. For appetizers, I opted for the meatballs, which were my favorite part of the meal, while my friends both had generous servings of the burrata (accompanied by more grilled bread). Although all of that was pretty filling on its own, I had gone to dinner with an appetite and therefore managed to finish my cacio e pepe. It was some of the black-pepper-iest pasta I have ever had, which in my book is a good thing! My friends did not get through much of their pesto pasta, but that was less a reflection on the quality of the dish than on the amount of food we'd already consumed by that point. We ended up taking our desserts to go, and although I usually am not much of a cake person, I did later enjoy the two little chocolate cakes that came with my meal. \n\nThe vibe of the restaurant is exactly what you would expect from Garces; most of them feel somewhat similar to me and this was no exception. Our server was very friendly and helpful, so either the service kinks have now been worked out for we really lucked out. The location is a bit odd, however, and probably diminishes my probability of returning. \n\nIn summary, 24 met my expectations and provided a pleasant dining experience with above-average food and service, but I don't know that I would go out of my way to get there again. There are both better Italian restaurants and better Garces restaurants in the city, so the pull to 24 is not strong for me."

The schlep from 15th street did promote some reluctance but I finally sucked it up and made the trek this past Friday evening. \n\nI did make a rez earlier that day (like an hour before) bc I'm not keen on waiting but I don't think it was required. After some confusion regarding actually entering the building at the right place, we were seated. It was actually freezing cold but that might have been my fault for under-dressing (in my defense it was like 8000 degrees outside). I will confess that I have a temperature comfort range that spans approximately 1.5 degrees. \n\nI would also like to point out that I think the pre-meal table bread is a pretty critical component of the Italian restaurant meal but was however absent at this place. \n\nThere's a bunch of shit that looks tasty on the menu, including cocktails and food. We spent a significant amount of time deliberating about both what we were going to order and who was going to decide. Final decisions included verde salad bc I'm a brussels/fava bean bitch, pesto bc I'm a pesto bitch, and eggplant pizza bc it's what my GF wanted and who am I to say no to that gorgeous babe. \n\nThis restaurant as the option to make many of the dishes either vegetarian or even vegan, which is clutch. I asked for the verde salad vegetarian and when the waiter brought it over he said \"without the bacon\" or whatever meat comes on it but the dressing has anchovies.... Luckily the anchovy-y/oceany flavor that petrified me was not present but unfortunately neither was flavor in general really. This was a bit bland but I ate it bc I was hungry and it was in front of my face. \n\nPizza was really good but pizza is hard to fuck up. There was like maybe 4 little circles of eggplant which is fine bc I'm not like head over heels about eggplant in the first place. I'd definitely try more pizzas from here tho. The pesto was really delicious. I crammed every last noodle into my stomach 2/2 its tastiness. \n\nThis place was overall good as for 99.9% of restaurants there are both better and worse choices."
