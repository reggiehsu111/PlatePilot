They aren't pretentious, at all, and have a chill funky homey vibe about then. The people there are pretty friendly and welcoming. I had solid drinks from Red Hook. But if you are looking for a coffee shop that can serve good drinks and good food, then Red Hook blows away the competition.  I've been to cafes that serve good drinks, but not good food. This place serves both!"

Or better yet, for a tasty brunch with no lines to wait in. Their eggs seem most popular, but my favorite is their Red Hook sandwich. Each sandwich comes with a small bowl of salad which is like a painting of flavor. \n\nI come here a lot to work. (It's near my home). The only reason I don't come here every time I need to work is I don't want to get tired of it! It's cozy but never seems crowded. \n\nAlso, they put on fun events after hours once a month to serve food and drinks and showcase local artists. \n\n A true community oriented business. There's definitely close-knit regulars, but always room for new faces."

        "text": "First a little disclaimer, this review is for the drinks only, I've never eaten here, also the reason for the four stars.  I walk dogs in Red Hook's neighborhood so I often find myself nearing the end of the day in need of a pick me up or warm up within blocks of this gem.  \n\nThe decor is amazing and welcoming.  Really cute and comfortable furniture lines one wall while a bar with chairs lines the windowed wall.  The employees are NICE, something oddly lacking in a lot of Philly coffee shops.  They are also talented baristas and my drinks are consistent and damn tasty.  My favorite drink is their seasonal Ancho Chile Hot Chocolate- my god! It's pricey but you can taste why.  The drink is pure bliss, chocolatey and sweet, milky and smooth but with a spice and little bits of ancho chile to chew on between sips.  \n\nI've also had plain coffee, of which you have a choice of roasts, and a few other fancy coffees.  Someday I'l try one of their paninis or vegan sweets and see if they are worthy of a fifth star.  \n\nOne time I stupidly spilled a large portion of my drink while trying to add cream and sugar  with the same hand I was using to hold a dog leash(did I mention you can take your doggie here).  The dog pulled and coffee went everywhere.  Fail.  The baristas were so nice, they didn't get mad at me, helped me clean up and refilled my coffee.  Yet another reason why I go here more than any of my local coffee places and tip every time."

        "text": "So I must first admit: I don't drink coffee.  Never had a drop in my life.  Finding a coffee shop that caters as much to the non-coffee drinkers can be a challenge.  I was expecting to go elsewhere on this hot Sunday afternoon, but it was closed for the holiday weekend.  Yelp helped me find Red Hook.  Like another reviewer, I noticed that the staff was sitting chatting with friends when I walked in, but she stood right up to assist me.  She offered her recommendation for an Earl Grey with Caramel Latte.  It was a great choice.  Good flavor... and something I never would've considered on my own.\n\nMy one (maybe two) issues with Red Hook is that the place feels a bit like visiting a college kid's shared house.  The mismatched furniture is cute, but worn and dirty.  There was dust and dirt everywhere.  And, probably due to the heat outside and frequent door openings, lots of bugs.  They also didn't have air conditioning.  My fault for ordering a hot drink, but still... a coffee shop should feel cozy: warm in the winter and cool in the summer.\n\nI may come back for additional drinks, but probably not for sitting for any length of time."

The small space was quiet with one 1-2 other tables of customers but tons of foot traffic of folks stopping in to grab a coffee. I was indecisive and asked for a recommendation on a breakfast sandwich. Ordered the Preacher Man which was a good blend of sweet and savory. Bonus points for the tempeh bacon and veggie sausage options. I think all sandwiches come with a side of potato salad which was also tasty. Would definitely stop back if I'm this neck of the woods again."

They have a very large selection of sandwiches and so far the ones I've tried have been really tasty. Today I had the philly wrap which is chicken, avocado, roasted red peppers and tomato along with homemade potato salad. It may seem simple, but it was just done really well and everything was fresh.

They always had great music, eclectic art, yum hot drinks (esp their spicy ginger chai!), fresh vegan, veggie and meat eater food options...and usually friendly solid service.  The pets add a nice warm component to the whole vibe as well.  I would see neighbors stopping in for a cup of coffee on their morning walks.  Nice.  Really nice.  \n\nWhen I was in school I came here around 3+ times a wk and would eat half a dozen meals in their sunny window seat.  I wrote a book in this place...  \n\nBUT SOMETHING WENT WRONG!  I came back from boston (not exactly the warmest of cities) and now the staff's too cool for school.  I'm used to the hipster attitude but really...no \"hello\", no eye contact, not one smile or acknowledgment that I'm talking to you and trying to order a 4$ chai latte?  I really tried last time.  I ended up laughing at myself outloud as the girl behind the counter completely ignored what I said and turned around.  I was literally embarrassed.  To top it off now my favorite ginger chai is watered down, mostly milk and served luke warm... Where's the spice and ginger?  No more fun spicy lentil pasta side dishes and the attitude...god the attitude!  I can't believe other reviewers say they're friendly.  They must be part of some special club or I keep missing the nice baristas.  I've tried 3x in the past 2 weeks to get back to loving Redhook but I think that last episode did me in.\n\nThe food.  The ambience, the ginger chai - This place was created to be amazing.  I bragged about Redhook in the neighborhood.  Baristas wake up...coffee shops are not just about a good cup of coffee (which you DO well).  Its a service industry.  You were handed a gem and did no work for it.  I think you actually like your job so why pretend to be so cold.   The old owner went to pretty decent lengths to create the warm cozy vibe and you're ruining it for the old regulars.  Im uncomfortable sitting there and the music is far too loud to be enjoyable.  Prices are over the top and the foods not nearly as awesome.  To the new Redhook fans, I really wish you tried it a couple years ago.  Everything was better then.  Wish the old owner would come back. Its such a great spot! Darn."

With L/T on a rugged multigrain bread, it's hands down the best egg salad I've ever had. They have a nice style with every food item, nothing is taken for granted, just as they didn't do a routine egg salad. Yes, comes with the horse radishy potato salad, yum. Excellent coffee, semi-friendly baristas - what more could you want? As mentioned, I particularly like their potato salad, check it out, it comes with sandwiches but I believe you can also order it as a separate side order. Outdoor seating is a plus. Wifi and warm, quiet atmosphere (despite the many young kids that are brought in) make it not a bad place to get a little work done as well."

It's a place where two hard working women (Chloe and Kelsey) have created a space for artists to provide exposure for their work, for people who are Celiac like me, for vegans, and animal lovers.  It is an atmosphere where the baristas are self-expressive and friendly people themselves. My family when they visit from Pittsburgh make sure they go there - the food is great, creative and more than what one would get at an expensive brunch place. \n\nSo for those of you who have been there once - don't complain and write bad reviews. Ask us that go there daily, and are committed to these two hard working women and to this place that is \"common ground\" for many."

The decor is nice and they feature different artists selling their work monthly.  The owner is very nice as well, and they're dog friendly.\n\nOther times, the coffee made by the snubbish barista's has been good, but just good at a price that's a little above average.  I appreciate they serve organic items and try to be enviromentally friendly, but at a price.  The smoothies are good but I don't think they're made with fresh fruit, and for $5, I'd like fresh fruit.  I'd never order food there again.  I had a chicken basil pesto sandwich once and had food poisoning for 2 days, and then I later learn 3 of my friends have gotten food poisoning as well from their sandwiches!

The ingredients are fresh and delicious, they have plenty of gluten free / vegan / vegetarian options, which my wife always goes for, but not having any of those restrictions myself, I still had tons of great choices as well.\n\nI would highly recommend the Happy Hooker, it's a grilled three cheese sandwich with thick bacon and tomatoes.  I asked them to add some fig jam on there for me and it was amazing.  The chocolate peanut butter smoothie was also a great take away on a hot spring day.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this place, and I will definitely hit it up next time I'm in Philly!"

The soy milk is out in its own pitcher with the other milks so you don't have to ask for it specially, and there is sugar water available for cold drinks.  \n\nThere are lots of vegan food options available!  They have soy cream cheese for the bagels, and you can substitute \"fakin' bacon\" for the real stuff in any of the sandwiches and wraps.  You can also get fresh avocado on just about anything, which is always a winner in my book.  I got the curiously named \"Jackie O\" wrap, which is an ingenious combination of banana, honey, peanut butter, and granola.

There are also sweets, which I'm told come from Homemade Goodies by Roz (a favorite bakery of mine).  \n\nAside from fair trade coffee, I read that they are socially responsible in many ways, including recycling coffee grounds for local farmers (that's so AWESOME) and recycling everything else they can.\n\nTry the ancho chile hot chocolate, which is sweet and spicy and rich. that alone will keep me coming back for more!\n\nThe cafe itself is comfortable, with good music that's not too loud.

I looked at him in surprise and said \"I'm sorry?\" and he said again \"Not gonna happen\".  Finally I recovered enough to say \"Why not?\" and he said \"We're out of plain bagels\".  Now look, would it have been so hard for him just to say that the first time?

Red Hook Coffee & Tea is my perfect woman of coffee shops.\n\nThe interior is great.  It's not overbearingly beatnik, nor is it too corporate and cold.  The balance of art and comfort sat well with me.\n\nThe coffee was good.  I don't know coffee well enough to critique it.  If it's good, then I'm a fan.  However, what put a spring in my cowlick was the simple, but delicious bagel sandwich with hummus, red onion, and tomato.\n\nWow!  I've been eating the wrong bagels!  The bagel was soft and fresh, and the simple toppings complimented each other so well that you would think they met at an orgy.  Light, but hearty.  Rich, but not thick.

I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich with olive tapenade, I think there was just a smear of tapenade, for a dollar extra I wanted more.

We called 1 hour to close (we live a few blocks away) and while I can't remember what she ordered, I know that I got the BLT + A. Everything was fine and dandy until we got there and realized it's cash only (I know, I'm one of those people but it's 2017! Come on!) So my roommate goes to take out cash and I noticed the bill was incredibly high. I asked to look at the receipt and see we were charged an EXTRA $2 for EACH sandwich for the avocado. I asked the woman at the front what that was for, and she pointed to a sign on the counter that said that avocado would be a $2 upcharge because of demand or something like that. So, let me tell you that both sandwiches are ALREADY made with avocado, with mine having \"avocado\" in the name. How are you going to charge $2 for a few slices of avocado on a $6 sandwich? That makes no sense. I would understand if I added avocado to an existing sandwich that didn't already have one, but the $6 price already reflects the cost of the avocado. My second qualm here is that when we called, WE WERE NEVER TOLD OF THE UPCHARGE! I would have gotten something else with no issue. \n\nWhen both of these points were raised to the extremely rude worker at the front, she scowled and gave myself and my roommate and attitude. I asked for the manager and she said that they were not there and \"even if they were here, they would say the same thing.\" Words cannot describe how incredibly rude this woman/girl...I'll call her a girl...was to us. No \"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. Unfortunately this is our current policy. I'd be happy to remove the avocado for you if you wouldn't like to pay\" or anything pleasant of the sort! We left without the food. \n\nSo that was the one bad apple. However, I decided to give it another try yesterday morning because I really do love gluten free and vegan foods. This experience was significantly better. I essentially took like 5 things off of the menu in other items and created my own \"concoction\" and they were very accommodating and helpful! They even made the thing look pretty, too! \n\nOverall, I think I will be back...just not at night when that awful person is there. Remember it's CASH ONLY, though!"

        "text": "Red Hook is the best cafe I have been to in the city.\n\nThe atmosphere is really cozy. Exposed brick, wood floors, warm red walls, little tchotchkes all over. Sort of vintage store-like with any type of seating you could ask for- barstool seating in front of the window, couches, huge ornate comfy chairs, and tables/wooden chairs for when you actually have work to do. The environment is more social than a lot of other places in the area. It's rare that I go in and another customer doesn't strike up a conversation at some point before I drag out my laptop to work. The customer base and baristas seem  unpretentious and aren't snotty if you ask to tweak your food order and have offered to run out and get ingredients/whip up a new batch of something if they just ran out and the place isn't too crazy. I've actually seen a barista run to the store to get yogurt to make a parfait (it was at the end of the day...it's not like she didn't have it stocked at 9am) rather than just say \"sorry, we're out.\" And without asking \"do you want me to make some?\" and therefore guilting me into saying no, the barista just took it upon herself to make a whole new batch of herb cream cheese when it ran out the last time I was there. Such great customer service.\n\nThey have awesome food. The tuna melt is insanely delicious in particular. And The Preacher Man-  a sandwich with chicken, pesto, and apricot preserves - is such a weird combination, but it works. The sandwiches all come with a surprise homemade side. They rotate it, but in the past I've had \"cornslaw\" and purple potato salad. They err on the spicy side, but are always a hit with anyone I've ever brought there. In addition to all the muffins/cookies (a lot of which are vegan), wraps, and the bagels (whose toppings are never skimped on), they're also able to make a lot of the hot stuff in store- Paninis, HUGE egg sandwiches, and homemade soups. I don't tend to get a lot of coffee things, but the iced coffee has never seemed watered down and they're always trying new things out (the chocolate ginger chai awaits me).\n\nYou should seriously go here. Queen's Villiage is cute to walk around in general and Red Hook is right near a few thrift stores, a book store, and a ton of fabric places to browse through if you take your coffee to go."

This is one of the best, if not THE best, BLT I have ever had. The bacon application is generous and different (trimmed of fat, then crumbled, and then cooked so each individual crumble is perfectly crisp and chewy), tomatoes were plentiful and juicy, greens were flavorful and perfect, avocados were ripe and spread onto every millimeter of toast... when they forgot the sprouts we were given a huge plateful. The complementary side of potato salad with cucumbers was an unexpected treat and extremely delicious (I don't normally even like potato salad).\nDrink: Chai (not sure which flavor) with skim milk.

It used to be my go-to lunch date with my dog when I was in school or on the job hunt , and both of us needed a change of scenery. Now, no more dogs hanging out inside but that's ok. I get it, we're not in Europe. :(\nThe BLTA is just A-mazing. It is all about the perfectly cooked and huge heap of crumbled bacon  so as not to pull out the entire strip in one bite. The whole grain bread, addition of avocado and yes the funny look when I ask for vegannaise but not Fakin-bacon is A-ok !  I love the lil side bowl of interesting grain or potato salad. \nMy husband once got a breakfast wrap which to him was uninteresting and a bit dry, but since then he's snuck back without me for sandwiches--his favorite was something with peach jam and grilled chicken? I dunno. I keep going back to my fave BLT here. I love their iced coffee too."

The boyfriend ordered a Vegan Elvis (peanut butter, banana, agave and vegan bacon then pan fried) and fell in love! It came with a side of vegan potato salad. Would definitely recommend to both a vegan and/or non-vegan. It looked and tasted delicious (picture included for drooling purposes). \n\nI went with a toasted sesame bagel with cream cheese and bacon. Simple but delicious--I promise you. I was expecting bacon strips but it was covered in bacon bits so every bite was perfect!\n\nWe were both happy with the choice and agreed it's definitely a spot we'd come back to when in Philly. Don't hesitate, just go! You won't regret it."

I love that they have peppermint during holiday season. I usually get the juevos banditos wrap and it is delicious. I recently tried the celestial bagel and while it is delicious and loaded with lettuce, tomatoes, tempeh and a creamy sauce it does fall apart a little as you eat it. Their service has always been fine and they have a few tables with chairs outside to sit as you wait or enjoy your food there. Will continue to go here and explore their menu."

It was fairly easy to find a street parking spot on a weekday morning, and I walked up to order a coffee and breakfast sandwich. Highly, highly recommend the peacher man - it's a sandwich with egg, veggie sausage, and peach jam, and it was delicious! The coffee was great too. I'd definitely come back here again for coffee or takeout breakfast."

Always filling, satisfying without weighing you down.  This screams quality ingredients.  Everyone is really nice here too.\n\nThe place also has a definite edge to it, but not so much where you feel uncomfortable like another coffee shop further down 4th St. that rhymes with Schmindcore Mouse.  I always feel like they think I'm a cop when I walk in there.  I'm not a cop."

Ever since there really wasn't much to offer on the beautiful 4th Street shopping of the finest fabrics and materials. Besides The Famous Tea House, which really isn't a cafe, just a place to pick up really good DIY tea for home. Then Red Hook hooks in and sinks right into the heart of this taken for granted area of Queens Village. They even have nifty red cups with their logo of the hook to help promote this slowly but surely, increasingly popular underdog. Some people complain why sell fair-trade coffee when the cups aren't environmentally sound, so what? Take your 'Whole Foods' lifestyle to someone who cares. Everyone's doing their fair share of killing the planet and people like you are only making it worse. Besides don't even get me started on what soy is costing us. Back to Red Hook, they just revised the place, making it more spacious, cozy, and friendly for any new-comer or patron-saint since day one. What I love most is that it doesn't just attract one kind of crowd. Everyone is welcome and they eagerly anticipate that from the moment a hipster to an elderly couple stumble in. Their variety in scones and cakes are sublime and it goes great with something from their hand-crafting espresso bar. They have wi-fi too but what I like to see is people conversing and that does happen here. A great place to stop in before you begin your morning or afternoon hunt for inexpensive fabrics to make your dress for an upcoming show or party."

So I decided to come in and spice it up ancho style..\n\nwith an ample helping of sweet chocolate, ancho hot pepper, and whipped cream, their spicy hot chocolate REALLY gave my taste buds a good kick. and I really dug the vibe that the house had overall. it had a punk rock feel, but it wasn't too in your face punk. the art was some of the best that I've seen out of a coffee house, and they even had an old school hip hop poster for a rap shop that happened at The Spectrum! It was the perfect spot to stop in and read my Dali book. but I'll definitely be back to take advantage of the Wi-Fi.\n\nI didn't have any of the food but it smelled delightful.

Thai Peanut Latte) and I've been a fan. They're pretty strong, coming from someone who drinks coffee every 3 months, and quite tasty.\n\nIt's a lovely place to come chill and have breakfast, or chill and have lunch or chill and ... chill. They also have art on the walls and have openings with lots of people (I haven't been to one yet) so I assume some free booze is involved. I usually really enjoy their shows. It's probably not the best coffeeshop in QV, but it's my favorite coffeeshop (now tea shop ... that's another matter ;)"

Self-important critics complaining loudly and shamelessly about everything from celebrities they think are 'too fat' to costumers that annoy them.
