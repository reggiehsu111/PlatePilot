This tops most places that don't even include any of that. \n\nLike others ensure they take your order correctly. I once ordered a Spanish omelette and ended up with a Spinach omelette with feta. It was still really good  so I didn't complain but it was definitely not what I ordered. \n\nThe delivery guy is always nice and courteous and I have no complaints there at all. I will keep coming here since I know the food and pricing includes a good amount of stuff."

The wait was average for take out but the person behind the counter seemed new and overwhelmed with the small amount of business (me waiting to pay, and order she just took and already forgot, and a phone call that she took part of the order from and then told to hold).   My chicken sandwich was not made the way it was described in the menu which made it not a CCB.  It was served with a side of what I can only guess was the last remaining breakfast potatoes.  Not only where they not what I was expecting to receive with a lunch meal (ordered at 11am), but they were way overlooked, some burnt, and completely cold.  In addition, most of the pieces of potatoes were just small fragments of what used to be much larger pieces resulting in more of what could be described as potato crumble. Burnt potato crumble.  Burnt cold potato crumble.  All of this came to almost $10 with tax.  Had I not ordered this meal as take out and left the area it would have definitely been sent back. My first experience there left me feeling less than satisfied and ripped off."

Since selling the business, they've had 2 new owners. I recently visited Cafe Victoria. The service is better. Still makes a great breakfast sandwich. They've set up square so you can pay for inexpensive orders with your credit card. I feel the average ratings are from when the business used to be Jany's."

Its not open all day unfortunately, but you can get a great breakfast or lunch for a great price. They have great burgers for a couple of bucks, and if you're there for breakfast you can try a bacon and egg burger!  It's not on the menu but they made it for me at 8am and it was great.  My girlfriend and I eat here pretty regularly and we both leave full for about 15-20 bucks. Enjoy!"

First because it's right across the street from my apartment, and second because it's one of those old school mom-n-pops diner you end up either loving or hating.\n\nGranted, its served by an older couple and therefore the service is not gonna be as fast as going to a drive-thru. You also won't get the best eggs in the world.\n\nBut you don't come to this kind of diners expecting wonderful service and amazing food. These place cater busy folks that need cheap and quick comfort food. And they deliver. Anybody expecting something different should not go into this kind of diners.\n\nFor the price i paid coffee is surprisingly great, bacon was nice and crispy and the home fries had some actual taste on them. Oh and they do know how to cook sunny side up eggs.\n\nI'm totally coming back. See if I can become friends with these old folks."

If I'm paying for a flounder fillet at a restaurant, I want it to be breaded on premises. I could have bought Van de Kamp's or Gorton's and had the same thing. I can't imagine their other food is this bad, but I won't be trying them again anytime soon. They also messed up my (in person) to go order, giving me the wrong side dish and forgetting the lemon wedges I requested, even though I stated it clearly twice and I speak clear, unaccented English."

The decor is a snapshot of 1987 ( pink and baby blue walls and sentimental motel art everywhere) and customers rarely eat in. \n\nLuncheonettes specialize in fast American breakfast and weak coffee. Jany's lives up to this tradition. You won't get the best egg sandwich, but for $2.15  ( for a large coffee AND a sandwich) my broke ass will go there every day and be quite happy.\n\nShoot for going here before work or during an early break because, like all other luncheonettes , Jany's tends to close around 3 pm. Honestly, there is nothing exceptional about Jany's. It's just a dependable standards when you're late, hungry and in a rush. Go here for the basics, with few expectations and you should be content with what you get. \n\nEnjoy !"

I only order breakfast items or the veggie burger (which is what everyone on our staff raves about). When I've strayed and ordered other items, they've been sub-par. \n\nYes, the older Greek lady is rude and they constantly mess up your order. I continue to get a real burger instead of a veggie burger, and when I come back to say it's a mistake, I get told that it's my fault and that's what I ordered. \n\nYes, the prices are never the same. Check the menu and make sure that you're not getting charged more than you should. \n\nYou definitely get what you expect here. Poor service, okay food (but the veggie burger is delicious except for the few times they've been overcooked)."

That being said, the food and location aren't nearly on the same level. The salad was mediocre. The grilled chicken on top did not taste like it'd been freshly prepared. If it had been, it must have been sitting on the counter for a long time because it was lukewarm by the time it arrived at the table. The French fries, however, are delicious and I admire the management's mission to make it's establishment paperless."

I was there one day last week & my food taste horrible my fries & burger were under cooked. I believe in second chances so I went back today.  The tomatoes on my sandwich were bad. The new owners seem not to care very much. They are always fussing at each other in the kitchen I guess they think we can't hear them. News flash we can. Jany wasn't very nice but these people are 10 times worst at least jany food was good. The guy that works there needs to not be in food service at all, better yet anything that has to do with serving people. There is  this one girl that works there who's awesome.  Not sure what her name is but I'm sure it starts with a k. Oh wait it's kia if I'm not mistaking. She does her job really well, way better then the owners. My roommates eat there as well. The caf\u00e9 was the topic of conversation last week & today also. Which is what made me write this review. If it wasn't for the one nice person that works there they would off been shut down. Caf\u00e9 Victoria y'all need to get it together.  Things have really changed & it shows. Really not a good look so if y'all wanna make it to see 2016 you better tighten up."

First of all, Jany wasn't there, it was a different rude woman I'd never seen before. Second, the turkey in my club sandwich was slimy, gross cold cut turkey. What happened to my sweet jany's???"
