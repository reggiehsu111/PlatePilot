After an extremely long wait to be seated as usual, your told 15minutes that could easily turn into an hour and that's just the appetizer. My girlfriend and I are finally  seated, and I notice the waitress is giving my girlfriend plenty of eye contact as we place our order and giving me very little to none  like I was  a freakin ghost very unprofessional and I'm thinking\" what's up with that\" this is the first course. Right now already not feeling this place. Anyway, I ordered the jerk wings with the waffles. HORRIBLE ass salty caked on jerk like paste they use for the wings the waffles were good but those wings could've found more of a home in the trash. That was the icing on the cake for me. Had to even ask for more napkins from the waitress as she proceeded to look as she was rationing them out. They give you one silly paper napkin and I guess that supposed to hold you. At the end of our luxurious meal I told the waitress the wings are way too salty, she looked disappointed as if she personally made them. She asked if I wanted something else \"right know I'm really disgusted \" I said no just bring the check. My girlfriend said she would take them and maybe scrape some of the brine off they should be okay.What ever.... The waitress still looking like she was very disappointed. Oh well.... I see why Gordon Ramsey stays so angry at some of these restaurants. Because they really don't know what they are doing.If people are so hyped about this place I want to know what they are ordering please post. Maybe the cook didn't feel like cooking today. Or I should've ordered water and lemon as the main course."

A patron recommended the whiting with cornbread and grits, which my cousin had, and she was not disappointed! I had the sampler, which was pure breakfast decadence. Imagine one red velvet waffle, a piece of stuffed French toast and a cinnamon pancake with a turkey scrapple side. It is a super busy place and reservations are accepted if you want to guarantee seating quickly. Do not plan on lingering over breakfast during the weekend!

People waiting in line said \"it's worth the wait.\"  I agree with previous customer reviews, no food is worth a 90 minute wait.  They had no idea how long the wait was going to be but told everyone putting their name in 30 minutes. At 1:15 they told people who had been in line for a hour or more that they were not going to be served since the restaurant closes at 2P.  As you might suspect people were upset.  We were one of the lucky group who got seated. The wait staff were very nice it took sometime to get beverages after we were seated then a few more minutes before our waitress took our order. Our food was served relatively quick considering the wait time for a table. \nThe food was hot and enjoyable. One plate was served poorly, the shrimp & grits was on a plate that was too small. All in all I would not wait 90 minutes for a table at any restaurant despite the food being good.  I hope they get their wait time worked out or they will not have a location in CH. Good luck!"

In our party we had some basic eggs and bacon, home fries, etc. Then also a salmon cake, hominy grits, and jerk chicken and waffles.\n\nAll were delicious. If any suggestion, a little lighter on the salt in the jerk seasoning. Other than that, we were very pleased with all the flavors.\n\nRegarding service, we got in, got coffee quick, placed an order, and had a short wait until our food arrived.

I was a little worried that it was taking some time but when our frittatas arrived it was obvious that they were made from scratch. As a cook it took just about what I would have expected time wise.

I got a waffle which had no decorations and just cut-up pieces of banana on it. No butter was served with the waffle. My friend got an interesting mound of eggs and some ham which looked skimpy in the middle of an otherwise empty plate. My iced tea was served without sugar or sweetener. When I asked for some, I was handed two Equals (no container of choices), and my friend had to make a separate request for sugar. He received a container with a spoon in it. He asked for cream and was handed three small separately wrapped cream containers. \n\nAt a breakfast restaurant where you pay 2 or 3 dollars for drinks, the restaurant shouldn't be so cheap as to hand out individual servings. Lots of us use more than three of those tiny cream containers.\n\nMy other major complaint was the background music. A few selections were fine (solos, soft etc) but music that involve large groups of singers or drummers and bands  disrupts the dining experience and makes it hard to hear conversations. This was extremely distracting.\n\nI won't be going back."

Honestly it's not hard to make an omelette.  Had to flag down our waitress to tell her the food was cold - she acted shocked and said ok one minute I have to do something.  Then sent a very uninterested person over to apologize who said he'd have our food remade quickly.  Waited another 15 minutes  and asked another waiter for the check for our coffee - he sent our original rude waiter over (who still hadn't removed the bad food from our table yet) over and she said I'm going to go check on your food.  We told her again - no thank you we need to leave it had been over an hour since we sat and still only had coffee.  She went downstairs got our food and put it in a Togo container. (REALLY).  I didn't want the disgusting cold eggs you served the first time why would I want a cold omelette in a to go container.  Told her again to please bring us a check for the coffee so we could pay.  She walked away and started helping other customers and would not come near us.  Finally told another waiter or said no need to pay for the coffee.  Absolutely terrible service - never been treated so rudely and the food that was served to me was cold and disgusting.

During the first visit (a weekday so not extremely busy) I waited so long to be waited on even after others came in after me that I had to get the attention of the waitress. When she finally came over she was completely oblivious. When the food came out and was different than she described it to be she said \"oh the kitchen decided not to prepare it that way. I don't know why.\" The food was just ok. She forgot one of the items that it said the dish came with and when I asked her about it she said oh it doesn't come with that even though it says it on the menu then she comes back and said oh it does. Then she brought out two pieces of toast--one burnt with butter and one burnt without butter. Then omelet was greasy but not horrible. \n\nTried it a second time today and it was even worse of an experience. The food again was just ok for the price and I didn't get something that I ordered. When the bill came I told them that they needed to take it off because I never received it. The waitress said ok she brought back the check it was correct so gave her the card but when it was swiped it was for the original incorrect amount. I told her it was wrong then a man came over to us and asked \"what do you want me to do?\" I was so annoyed at this point that I just said forget it we just won't leave a tip. Either way terrible service and overall management of this boutique. Very sketchy that they would swipe the incorrect amount and then have that type of tone and response of \"what do you want me to do?\" Not sure about the other locations but this one isn't a good reflection of what I thought the experience would be.

Our total time at our table- nearly two hours...for casual breakfast. Given this is a small -casual place, turning tables quickly (with quality service and food) should be a top priority. \n\nThe servers appear to lack proper server skills, although pleasant. Our server forgot to put our order in...(she admitted after we were waiting over 45 minutes). She didn't return to provide coffee refills (we had to ask the host twice to send someone). I would recommend that an investment be made in managing the front of the house as customers were pouring in and happily waited for a table.

Our waitress was nice but not nearly as available for questions (or to remind them that my friend did not get her side of fruit) as we would have like, given that it was a late Tuesday morning and it was not crazy busy.  The person who took our drink orders seemed out of his element and we all wondered if we would even get the right drinks. We did!  \n\nI am a local and will definitely be back.  I am looking forward to trying other things on the menu, because if today was any indication the other dishes will be great!"

I take into consideration that they are new and were slammed on Memorial day but knowing that this is their second location I expect most of those kinks to be worked.\nWhen we arrived we were told 20 - 30 minutes. We waited for 45 monutes before they seated us and another 25 at our table before anyone acknowledged we were sitting there. The manager (owner?) was chatting with one table of customers and the hostess sat up front on her phone when she wasn't answering the business phone. No one was refilling coffee or water.  Finally, the waitress took our order, we received our drinks and continued to wait another 45 minutes for our food. We ordered eggs with hash, pancakes and traditional eggs, bacon and hash-browns. The pancakes and eggs with hash came first. Two fluffy pancakes topped with a strawberry and \"Iknowthatwasnt\" butter, served with maple flavored high fructose corn syrup. The eggs and hash were over hashed and under seasoned. Then the bacon and eggs appeared with typical cubed potatoes, nicely browned with little to no seasoning. The bacon was tasteless. The egg-white of the over easy eggs were clear and even cool on the inside. But no one returned to ask us how our meal was until we were finished. I mentioned the eggs and the waitress said \"that's over easy\". She did offer to have them cook me new ones but by that time we were DONE. I did eat a bit of the under cooked egg and was sick for about 24 hours. Sadly, we were really excited about a breakfast in our neighborhood but this won't be it."

We shared the jerk chicken and waffles as well as the sampler platter which consisted of 1 cinnamon swirl pancake, 1 red velvet pancake, and 1 slice of stuffed French toast. The food was BOMB, seriously so good. We loved everything! The only downside was that service was sllloooww, so don't expect to be in and out quickly. However, the staff were all very friendly, so if you have time to chill definitely check out Breakfast Boutique. Reasonable prices and great food!"

We had an array of orders at our table and they were all terrible. The breakfast sandwich on a croissant was inedible. The croissant was literally so stale it was rancid. The eggs were rubbery and over cooked. The bacon was all dried out. The eggs Benedict were undercooked and the English muffin so stale you couldn't cut through it.  The \"cheese\" on all orders was orange and clearly pre-shredded from a bag- zero flavor. The sweet sampler we got was smothered in a sickening pink sauce meant to resemble strawberries - not fresh - and the pancakes and French toast were totally dried out. I literally feel sick after eating the small bit that I did. Second: the service. SLOW. The only saving grace was our sweet and kind waiter who apologized profusely for the food and very quickly removed two of the items off our bill. What a shame- so much potential.

It took an hour maybe longer for our food to come and we had to wait for a waiter to take our order for 25-30mins?! Never a \"sorry food will be out soon\" or \"sorry for the wait\" came our way, it was plain rude and we were starving with our 2 year old growing grumpier by every passing minute. When our food came we enjoyed the food it was nothing crazy delicious but also not disappointing. The big problems came when we asked for the check, our food was surprisingly expensive and we found out it was because they charged us the wrong amount for our two-year-olds meal. We ordered off the kids menu for him to have ham and eggs that were supposed to come with pancakes but we totally forgot didnt come because we are ourselves were just starving and not thinking by the time the food came. We asked them why the price was not the one on the kids menu and they said that we didn't make it clear enough that we wanted a kids meal. This whole thing really confused us because our two-year-old was supposed to get pancakes eggs and ham but instead only got eggs and ham yet they were trying to charge us more insisting that it was not the meal on the kids menu because THEY forgot to give us pancakes?!? After arguing like a customer should never do they told us they would change the price and that their receipt machine wasn't working so they would email us the receipt. Well I just checked my email and guess what.....THEY DIDNT CHANGE THE PRICE!! These people are liars and rude ones at that 20 out of 10 would not recommend coming here!

She never came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. \n\nFood: I ordered the stuffed french toast with strawberries. It was too sweet for me. I think it was the cream cheese filling. I had the turkey sausage which was two very thin patties and they  were overcooked so they were hard. My Sister got the waffles and they weren't good.

It took about 20-30 minutes just for us to get our drinks.  Then they never gave us straws.  When we asked for utensils (which, again, we had to ASK for) the person was kinda rude and it STILL took a while for them to deliver.  My mom's food was cold after waiting an hour.

(To put it nicely)\nLet's just say that, the length of time spent waiting for one's food should have some correlation to the awesomeness of its ultimate flavor.  And there ain't no food that can live up to a 90 minute wait (from signing in to plates to table). I mean, it's gotta be such awesome delicacy that you'll forget all about the inconvenience.  But I can't.  The food was mediocre and the waiting insupportable. \nAnd to think we brushed off previous comments about too long a wait.  We shouldn't have, but we've learned from our mistake.  \nMy wife wants to add details: \nThe problem here was not just the long wait. The problem is that people who were seated the same time we were got their food, ate, paid, and left before our food arrived. The problem is that when we asked about the food we were lied to and told that the hold up was the dish my son ordered - the exact dish ordered by the gentleman seated when we were. The problem is that when we became visibly agitated we were offered a free price of cake - before our food arrived. Because what one wants before breakfast is s big piece of cake. The problem is that at no point did anyone take responsibility or apologize. The problem is that rather than trying this right everyone has stopped speaking to us - everything has been brought and taken away wordlessly. In short, the problem is the worst service I have ever encountered. \nFinally, my son said: for the wait to be worth it, the food should have been better and fed to me while I laid in bed watching YouTube."

A few more minutes passed before a waitress FINALLY approached and took our orders.  We weren't served our food until 40 minutes later.  No apologies or explanations for the wait, and the restaurant was very quiet at this point.  I can understand waiting a bit longer for food if an establishment is jam packed, but can't fathom why simple breakfast food should take such an excruciating long time if the place is empty.

But we were celebrating a birthday, so we made the best of it.  I really wanted to like this place.  The final straw was when my husband and my uncle went for breakfast.  My husband figured that he would give them one more chance.  They waited 20 minutes once seated for someone to acknowledge.  They are slow, so the food took a while to be served.  They chatted and waited.  Once the meal was delivered, the server forgot my uncle's toast.  When he finally got someone's attention, he asked for it.  They brought it to him on a napkin, not a small plate, and laid it on the table.  They didn't speak a word, just put it there.  \nThe final, final straw came when the server came and told them that there is a 15-minute limit after you are done eating. We do understand that the place is small but when you are that slow to acknowledge patrons and to bring their food, don't rush them.   My uncle said that he would never go back even if they send a limousine and the food is complimentary. The food is inconsistent, and the service is consistently slow.

We waited 20 minutes and were told they would call there other location because they had availability. I watched the manager call and put our names in, told us it would be a 30 minute wait but they would seat us. It took us about 15 minutes to get to the other location. When we arrived we were told that the other manager never called (even though I heard him call) and they were not taking any more parties that large. After asking to speak to manager he offered to seat us but it would be another 30 minutes or more. Like I said, this was not the 1st time we have had a bad experience and the managers never are accommodating. One time my husband never received his food, another time they lied and told us they didn't have an menu item when another table received that very item after we requested it, they have run out of orange juice, apple juice, and cranberry juice at times (remember they are known for breakfast).

We ordered a few different options which allowed us to taste different things. I must say that everything tasted delicious. The sweet potato hash was phenomenal. The fish (whiting) was fried perfectly, not too salty or over seasoned. The garlic wings were slamming. The shrimp & grits were as pleasing to the tongue as they were to the eyes. The order of French toast was HUGE. The whole table prob could've shared one order. But they too were tasty & filling. I would definitely recommend this spot & I can't wait to go back for more. Oh, and out waitress Talia was the bomb!!!"

Worst service I've ever received in my life.\n\nOur order:\nFish and grits\nChicken and waffles\nKids silver dollar pancakes \nRed velvet pancakes\n\nWe waited a whopping TWO hours to receive our food.  I saw tables seated after us served our food (their French toast was burnt) and they received their REPLACEMENT food before we ever even served our initial order.   The food runner was a nice, apologetic gentleman but our server couldn't care less.    \n\nI had to get up and walk to the service area to ask for a refill of water.  My daughter had to get up and do the same to obtain syrup for her waffles.   The kids meal is a joke.  I was told it was a \"whole meal\" but the tablespoon of scrambled eggs and 1/4 strawberry were not nearly enough for my 8 year old who almost never finishes his entire meal. \n\nWe didn't even see our server again until our food was finished and she was asking if we wanted to go boxes.   When I expressed my displeasure with the service she stated she didn't visit the table because she saw other people talking to me. No discount was offered and no apologies were given.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the decent food (7.5) is eclipsed by such poor service.  I wont miss it."

        "text": "So my friend says let check out this place I saw on channel 3 this morning. She couldnt remember the name so I typed in breakfast chestnut hill  and wow Google located it. It was about a 30 minute drive and luckily a parking space . So we go in, small place. You don't smell anything. Ok so we sit down, love the deco, black and white paisley on walls. We were given 2 menus, as we looked. We 're like wow, trying to take it all in. The menu called out \" try me\", so much to choose from and some of the choices was vegan. Anyway I ordered grits and whiting, you could have talapia, salmon, shrimp, sauteed or fried and corn bread was included. My friend got homefries and fish,  potatoes was cooked with red and green peppers. Ummm it was spool good. The whiting was fried to perfection,  tasted like not another fish was ever fried in the oil. Fresh and clean, I savored the taste. Grits was good, just too much butter on them for me. The next time I go and I WILL be going back. Next time I will try the pancakes or the French toast, or the Belgium waffles, or maybe the sampler, where you get one of each. Or maybe I will just get fish and grits again, I love grits. So get there early on a Saturday, last seating is at 3:30pm . Go. All other info you have to find on your own. I'm only speaking what I know. It's good and not expensive. Take your time, it is not a rusty place. You order it, it is cooked"
