We have been ordering through grub hub and our food was always right and here quickly. \n\nAfter receiving an email from this company letting us know that it's cheaper to order from them directly, I took that route. \n\nAn hour after I ordered, I called to see where my food was. The owner answered and told me that they hadn't started my food yet. Oops. \n\nI told them if they didn't think it would be here within the next 30 minutes to cancel my order. They assured us it would be here shortly. \n\nMy food arrived about 20 minutes later and we began to pass it out. I ordered three total bagels and a egg, chorizo  and cheese sandwich. One bagel was charred burnt and the sandwich was just regular sausage patties. \n\nMy husband called back to let them know how disappointed we were for ordering food from their site instead of grub hub as they suggested. The owner told us that because they were busy inside, their website ordering was pushed back. \n\nHe then explained that our food was incorrect and she told him he was lying. Why would a grown person call an establishment that they tend to frequent to lie about their service? She kept talking over my husband and telling him that we were incorrect for ordering our food the way it was ordered. Are you kidding me? She used the statement \"I'm not saying you're lying, but your food was made correctly\". That's literally saying we are lying. This drama is not worth it for bagels."

Asked for lightly toasted bagel, it was burnt around the edges. It didn't taste like it had scallion spread on it and for $10.74, it seems overpriced for what I  received. The nova was okay as was the whitefish salad which I picked off because my bagel was burnt.  Back to REAL Jewish delis. Trying to diversify?"

Delivery was about 50 minutes, not terrible but could have been sooner. Food was room temperature at best. Both orders incorrect. My omelette did not have the egg white veggie, it did not have the toast, it was as thin as two napkins on top of each other. Worse, I was charged more than the cost on the menu. The bagel did not come with the hashbrowns. They are not on Grubhub, we ordered by phone. Female had a heavy accent and asked us to repeat several times.

We had lox and cream cheese on a sun-dried tomato bagel, with a large (24oz) cappuccino; and egg and cheese on an everything bagel, with a large latte. The bagels were great; just the right crisp to the outside and nice and chewy inside. The lox and cream cheese was delicious, and the egg and cheese was too, made fresh. The price seemed reasonable for as good as the food tasted and as large as the drinks were, about $21 total. Obviously, you can be out the door for much less if you're just coming for the great bagels. We'll be getting our home bagel stockage here from now on. To pick up my coveted fifth star, I'd like to see more coffee drink options and maybe slightly bigger portions for the sandwiches. Oh, supposedly this place delivers too!

So whatever they were spending that hour doing, it clearly wasn't paying attention to the quality of their food. Grubhub has been trying now for almost 2 hours to get a hold of them for a refund, but they're refusing to answer the phone. I've ordered from them nearing a dozen times, and this experience has completely ruined all the rest. Late, rotten food, then ghosting on customers... I'll never order from them again.\n\nUpdate: After two days, Grubhub finally got a hold of them but they're refusing to do anything. So I called myself and the manager was so unbelievably rude and started yelling at me, not letting me speak. I was told that my brown smoothie ended up that way because the driver took too long to get there. Sorry, but fruit doesn't brown quite that quickly. I've waited an hour for their food before and all that happened was the smoothie separated. This was brown... But instead of trying to help, I was yelled at.
