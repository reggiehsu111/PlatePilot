We definitely did not have a great experience at all.\n\nThe only good part was our waitress, she handled everything well.  The food came out quick but maybe a little too quick.  Our appetizer, spinach and artichoke bites, came out frozen in the middle (they took them off the bill luckily).  \n\nAs for the main course, we both got Po-boys (one shrimp and the other catfish).  We expected full sandwiches considering we paid $14 and $16 but they were half sandwiches.  The fries tasted like they were fried twice, in fact everything we had tasted like it was fried, frozen and then fried again.  \n\nWe definitely won't be trying Acadia again anytime soon."

        "text": "I was invited out for dinner at Acadia. I was very excited to explore the creole themed restaurant. When you walk in you can hear New Orleans music  in the air, I immediately felt like I was in New Orleans. The restaurant is decorated according to theme and the ambience is very relaxed which is very nice. In review of the menu there were a lot of options to choose from that includes starters and entrees. We chose the gumbo. The ingredients made your mouth water and yes we were hungry. The gumbo came with a side of potato salad and a side of bread. We started our meal with small muffin shaped cornbread. It wasn't what I am generally use to;but,it was good and it had the texture of a cupcake. \n\nMoving on we had the potato salad, I really enjoyed it and didn't miss the boiled egg that usually accompanies this dish. The spicy bite of the salad was very unexpected but it was a pleasant surprise. Finally, we were prepared to dive into the gumbo. The gumbo was quit dark but I went in with a open mind. With the first bite we both noticed the scorched flavor of the entree. The chicken and the andouille was over cooked. Being a novice cook myself I immediately notice the meat and how I couldn't taste the flavor of the sausage at all. The chicken was mush. We explained to our waitress that the gumbo was over cooked. She stated that she would discuss with the chef. She then shared that the roux is darker and that may be the flavor we are tasting. Ok.\n\nMy mother and I then questioned if the roux would taste like smoke or scorched. My mother has been to New Orleans before and she stated that this gumbo is not from New Orleans. I've tasted gumbo before and have made it for my family numerous times and I was very disappointed in my meal. We didn't eat it. My mother ordered shrimp on her gumbo so we picked the shrimp off of her plate to have something. \n\nAhhh dessert,my mother ordered the baguettes as she remember enjoying them last year in New Orleans. I must say, they were delicious ! \n\nSuggestions: change the gumbo recipe, offer other options for customers to choose another entree, assure that staff is sharing the specials for the night(we overheard another waitress sharing the specials and had to ask our waitress for details) honestly I would have ordered the special if we were offered another option. Brown rice should also be an option. Our cups should be periodically filled with water we only received one glass no refill. \n\nAlso, we paid for our meal even though we did not have a meal we sent it back. We had drinks, cornbread, a few shrimp shared from my mother's plate and baguettes . A customer should not have to pay for a meal they didn't eat. Our meal was over cooked, scorched and we just didn't like it. We didn't eat it because we didn't want to get sick from eating burnt food. We didn't agitate, but wondered why we had to pay, our concerns.....ignored. We paid our bill and we also provided a tip and now please take this tip and adjust the service at Acadia. We originally came because my mother saw your restaurant featured on FYI Philly. \n\nAgain, enjoyed the dessert,cornbread, and potato salad. We removed the voodoo doll from our table to another table..........freakkkkkky!"

We managed that but sat unattended for 15 minutes. Ordered drinks to start and waters. Three different people showed up with waters despite our having received them. Drinks came 15 minutes later - and they were beer so no special prep. After 45-50 minutes we had no food - table next to us was in even worse shape. Never going back - on the positive side we walked into the restaurant down the street and had a lovely meal despite no reservation.

Felt kind of overpriced at $15 for two eggs and sausage on a stack of fries. Other than the fries not sure what was actually poutine about it. Was expecting cheese curds or what not. \n\nI'll probably be back to try lunch. I didn't see that many Cajun things on the brunch menu. No muffuletta sandwich etc kinda bummed by brunch."

The name alone is so corny that anyone from Louisiana would say \"oh look another restaurant called Acadia\" (be original). Roux isn't right and that is the key to any gumbo. Secondly I can tell this restaurant doesn't know the true history of Creole food and the fact that pretty much all \"Cajun\" dishes are stolen from Creole culture. Fresh is key to Creole dishes, but unfortunately the lack of quality agriculture in this region shows how it can impact good Creole dishes.  If I could give it 1.5 I would. If you are a rookie when it comes to Creole cuisine then this is your place. Otherwise if you're actually Creole this is not your place. This is another example of how if you don't grow up in the culture you won't ever get the dishes right. Looking forward to someone telling me about my own culture."

So I wanted to surprise her. I found Arcadia in a search and since several years ago we found Catahoula a little underwhelming, I surprised her with dinner on Saturday night.\n\nI made a reservation even though I thought that reserving a table for two was kind of silly. It turned out to not be as silly when the gentleman couldn't find me. I got an email confirmation but didn't think to save it to my phone or anything. I saved it here to show I wasn't crazy. We wound up sitting at the bar which was not ideal though the bartender Nikki did a nice job (it wasn't her, the wife is a shorty short and big bar stools are not comfortable for her for dining.)\n\nGot her a Sazerac which was good. I got an absinthe chilled and drawn through the sugar cube for that sweet mentholated taste I love so much and a Voodoo Cowbell Imperial Oatmeal Milk Stout which might have been the most luscious beer ever made. Good start.\n\nWe decided to turn it into tapas to try as much as we could so we got a shrimp po boy and substituted collards for the fries and medium size orders of the jambalaya and shrimp etouffee and we would split all three of them.\n\nBoth of the prepared dishes came out really tasty and flavorful.\n\nThe po boy tasted great - it might have been the best-tasting po boy in Philly. But it was also the worst value - six fried shrimp on what looked to be smaller than a WAWA shortie roll.\n\nWe had asked them to cut it in half and we literally thought that they misheard that we wanted half a po boy and gave us something from the lunch menu! Alas that was what $16 gets you. Damn shame. Forget about the principle of the matter, it just won't fill you up.\n\nWe left without getting Beignets because we had plans at 8 nearby.\n\nBeware when leaving Acadia: There is a huge step and the wife wound up hurting her ankle when she fell as we left. There may be a sign posted to beware the step, but I don't recall seeing it. If there isn't one, I recommend they put one there.\n\nOverall despite the fact the beginning started with a lost reservation and ended with an injury, we would probably give them another shot (though we're also gonna try Catahoula again to see if they've gotten any better), such is the dearth of quality NOLA cuisine in Philly. But we won't be getting po boys."

None of the tables were cleared and there was 1 person being the waiter, bartender, and food runner. Waited 20 minutes to get out beers, only to find that they were skunked and didn't taste ok. Went with a coke, no flavor. Tried to order a few things and they were \"all out\". Pondered for a little on what to order (while we sweat in the 80 degree room). As we sat there, tables around us were sending food back for tasting bad so we decided not to order, especially because the waiter didn't tell others that the gumbo of the day was mussels and shrimp, when it's usually non seafood there. Got the appetizers and were extremely disappointed. It took us 2 hours to leave that place. Service was terrible, but the guy was doing the best he could. Beignets could've broken a window, they were hard and not fresh. Very sad because this place had a good thing going, but they can't get their act together. Will not come back."

The bar was empty and there were just a few families at some tables in the back. Two musicians set the mood with smooth jazz and our server Brian promptly set out waters for us.\n\nI was a little baffled by the plastic cups the water came in especially when we were given a small carafe of water for refills in a lovely glass jar. Along with the beautiful vases if flowers the kiddie cups just didn't fit. My group started with a round of cocktails, an absinthe and champagne concoction called \"Death in the Afternoon\", fried chicken for the table, shrimp and grits, shrimp Etouffe and a vegan waffle plate.\n\nThe chicken was definitely fried to order and came out piping hot. The flavor for me was spot on, others said it was salty. I would have preferred some flats in the mix but we were given all drums.\n\nThe entrees were up next and unfortunately the presentation was ruined when the young lady who delivered the shrimp and grits brought it to our table by hoisting the plates from the back of our booth and slide them between us. The result was one plate spilled over directly onto my hand bag. I was not pleased. I was however glad it was my bag and not my moms white shirt. The proprietor who had been present came over to see about the problem but that's all she did. There was no inquiry about damage and I wasn't even offered a cloth to wipe my bag. She just blew it off and  is the main reason for low rating.\n\nThe brunch went on without any other incident. Brian was consistently amazing. Everyone enjoyed their meal but we agreed the consistency of the grits were better suited to the use of a spoon which was not provided. Instead of picking up a nice heapful most of the grits simply slid threw the fork. I would also rethink the shallow dishes they came in. If your crew has the harrowing task of getting the plate to the table by leaning over the back of the banquet and sliding it past your patrons lap maybe you need a deep bowl. A bowl and a spoon."

We split two entrees, and both enjoyed the Chicken and Andouille Gumbo and the Shrimp Monica. The gumbo was done in traditional NOLA style, and served with Crystal as it should be. Yum! I was very impressed with the Shrimp Monica, which was absolutely a triumph. The shrimp was meaty and prepped perfectly, and the rotini was a nice compliment.

Considering that it was only three of us in the restaurant the service was extremely slow. They got one of my friend's drink first and the rest of us had to wait another 10-15 minutes for our drinks. Which was odd. I didnt like my drink because it was too sweet. My friend didn't like her Hurricane drink because there was too much rosemary. Till here I would give them three stars. The reason I'm giving one star and if I could I would have given zero is that they brought the food for my two friends after a while but they failed to bring mine. \nMy friends were done with their food when my food finally arrived. And I need to mention again that we and one other couple are the only patrons in the place. I told the waitress I would like to return the food and just leave because this is obviously too late. She said ok and take my food back. After few minutes she came back with my food in a box and said the chef says we already made the food so you must take it! I checked the bill and they charged me for it. I said I don't think I should pay for this and I'm not taking it. She went back to the kitchen and after another 15 minutes of wait she said ok you don't have to pay and she took the box with her too.\nThis is so weird. I have never heard of a place that the service is so unprofessional and late and then they tell you must take the food because we already made it!! Clearly the owner doesn't know how to run a business...\nMy friend who had a jambalaya hated it because it was again too much rosemary. The other friend who had pasta and shrimp liked his food but then he was also frustrated with the service. Overall, they ruined our Halloween night! I would never set foot here again."

If you like Louisiana/Cajun style food with a kick, try this place out.  We liked every dish we tried and plus with the check in , we got a free food cup .  We had the seafood boil.  The only things missing were the mussels so they gave extra shrimp instead.  We also tried the \u00e9touff\u00e9e with shrimp, gumbo, fried chicken, fries and had the beignets for dessert.  Everything was so tasty and it was a great ending with the dessert.  We went during happy hour and had champagne and the hurricane.  The prices are very reasonable for happy hour.  The waitress/bartender's service was excellent. The only recommendation for improvement I would make is to have other selections of flavoring for the boil.  I would recommend this place if you want Cajun food.  The flavors are delicious and you won't be disappointed!"

Then, we step inside a beautifully decorated, warm and cozy place that gives you that 'at home' feel. Great job on just getting us in the door. But way, there's more!\n\nOnce we were seated, near the perfect fire place, near the big screen TV, we were immediately impressed by the friendliness of the staff. Smiling, approachable, ready to help. Based on some great recommendations from both, we had some yummy drinks and ordered some great food.\n\nBeing from Baton Rouge, I am familiar with the southern Louisiana traditions that Acadia carries forward. The food has that delicious flavor I haven't had in a while, yet makes me feel like I'm at home. I appreciate the combinations that Acadia has put together, combining two different flavors into a wonderfully delicious duet of flavor. From the nutmeg-n-rice base, to the wonderful Bearnaise sauce, the Egg Acadia was a great compliment to the overall experience. And the Shrimp Etouffee was absolutely amazing -- exactly what I was craving.\n\nFinally, we met the chef who gave his a wonderful history of the restaurant, as well as some really awesome plans for the future (i.e. Mardi Gras being just around the corner). He was very nice, and was a joy to chat with. Certainly has a lot of passion to make our dining experience truly wonderful! \n\nAll in, A+\n\nWe WILL be back, and will be telling everyone about this amazing place! Now, Laissez les bons temps rouler!! And THANK YOU for making a little piece of Louisiana right here in Philadelphia!!"

We did not need a reservation. Our server was helpful and lovely. He was the only server besides the bartender so as it got busier he wasn't quite as available but we weren't in a hurry and it's not like we were ever left waiting/wanting. We had 2 happy hour cups- etouffe and gumbo- both super delicious. We couldn't quite pick a favorite BUT maybe the etouffe had a slight edge. We then split the chefs boil bag (crawfish, shrimp, crab legs, mussels) and added sausage, corn and potatoes. Got the original sauce bc I'm a little bit of a wuss about my spice and it was perfect. A little spicy but not too much. It was everything I'd hoped it'd be!!! The flavors were amazing. We then couldn't pass up beignets and got an order that was hot and fresh and exactly as you'd expect! Cannot wait to go back! I highly recommend anyone to go and support this awesome establishment!"

        "text": "I will definitely be coming back to this place! \n\nMy boyfriend and I have tried Acadia twice. The first time when the restaurant was very new and still having issues with staffing and workflow. That night there were only a few customers in the restaurant and yet our food took forever to come out (I mean FORVER). When the food did finally come, it was actually the wrong dish entirely....but it was really good. They also served this awesome corn bread that was fresh out of the oven. Because the food was so good, we gave it another try. Last night was much smoother. Our waiter did a good job serving and our food came out in an appropriate amount of time (and was the correct order). This time we got the jambalaya again and the blackened catfish. Both were excellent. We also met the chef and owner who came out to ask us what we thought and get some feedback. He told us about how he spent time in New Orleans studying the cuisine and seemed really passionate about his recipes, which made me appreciate them even more.\n\nBy the way I love that they have also a vegan jambalaya option and a nice cocktail menu. We were pleasantly surprised to see they also serve happy hour on Fridays until 7 which is a huge plus! I hope this place catches on and starts to fill up because I really would love to see it grow. \nI think having the liquor license still posted on the door makes it look like it's still not open, especially since the doors are tinted and you can't see how cute it is  decorated inside (New Orleans theme, cute little touches around the restaurant like jars with candles wrapped in Mardi Gras beads and unique art pieces on the walls). \n\nIf you are curious about a new neighborhood spot with a different kind of cuisine than new American, give this place a try. There's not a lot of New Orleans themed places in Philly (and the bars that do have it are heavily focused on fried food). It's definitely worth a try."

Until $8pm !! Incredible deal for late working folks. \n\nMy favorite cocktail is Le Petit Mort which has a rosemary infused vodka, gin, lemon juice, rosemary simple syrup and grapefruit juice, shaken and then strained into a glass with a blow-torch seared spear of fresh rosemary (such a dramatic sight for the whole bar to see). I want to try other cocktails, but always am drawn to Let Petit Mort. The Hurricane is also delicious. They have fresh beers on tap flown in direct from NOLA, so Acadia is the only place in Philly that serves Abita Amber Lager. Red and White wines are also on tap and served by the glass, 1/2 carafe or full carafe.\n\nI love the Viet-Cajun Boil which is super flavorful as is, while my husband likes Burn Yo' House Down style, which is super hot. The shrimp \u00c9touff\u00e9e has deep flavors and the Creole Jambalaya is outstanding. I also enjoyed the Blackened Catfish with collard greens and mashed potatoes one evening. The remoulade sauce on the Shrimp Po Boy is classic tasty. While the roll is about 6\", it was plenty for me as it is served with seasoned fries. The chicken wings are the best I've ever had, with deep, soulful Cajun flavors. \n\nI just went for brunch this past weekend and was not disappointed. Bottomless Mimosas with whatever juice you prefer for $18. All the classic lunch and dinner Acadia dishes and then some great new breakfast options. \n\nThe beignets are a winner and they also serve chicory coffee.\n\nDid I mention that there is Comedy Night on Wednesdays with no cover and you will find live music regularly? They also show Saints games on Sundays. \n\nThis is a great little spot with beautiful decor and furnishings and very caring staff. Always a diverse crowd and always a great experience. Like a trip to New Orleans without the airfare."

What makes this restaurant particularly special is is its Cajun/Creole cuisine. (I will note that New Orleans is one of the favorite places in the world of me and my wife.)\nWe brought friends from other sections of Philly and even out of town here, and we were all impressed. There was a wide variety of starters available, from buidin balls (a type of hush puppy), jalapeno poppers, and chicken wings that were tastier than any I got elsewhere.\nOur entrees were also all good, from jambalaya, etouille (not sure of the spelling), catfish exquisitely prepared, and great collard greens as a side dish.\nWe will be sure to return, as this type of cuisine is hard to find in the first place, let alone prepared so well.

I came with two friends to have Saturday brunch early afternoon and there was not much of a crowd, so we were seated immediately. The service was warm, fast, and attentive. Unfortunately, the food left a bit to be desired. I ordered the Southern Comfort molasses lemon pancakes and the pancakes were flavorless. I never like wasting food, but I only managed to finish one pancake of three---part of that was due to the molasses making the pancakes super heavy, but it was mostly because the pancakes were bland and largely inedible.\n\nThat said, I should note that the beignets were fantastic---honestly better than the ones I had at Cafe du Monde last August. It appears they've changed their menu a bit since I last visited, so despite the mediocre meal the first time around, I will definitely be trying this place at least one more time."

Before I mention anything else, I want to be clear that the food here is very good. It would be hard to find better New Orleans style food in the area. But there are some definite corrections that can be made, which I'll detail here.\n\nWe ordered the wings as an appetizer, the catfish and jambalaya as entrees, and king cake for dessert. We've been to Louisiana multiple times and love the cuisine in that region. They do a good job here. The wings stood out as excellent- they cook them with a southern fried chicken batter, so they're like...mini fried chickens. The bar stocks Abita and makes Hurricanes, which is a great touch as well.\n\nThe service during our meal had issues. Our server, while maintaining a positive demeanor, was totally overwhelmed with duties. Which is understandable, since he was the only person serving the entire restaurant. This includes bussing. There wasn't a busboy to remove dirty dishes, so there were just empty tables filled with dirty plates. There was no way he could serve the guests and bus as well. With that being said, service was very slow.\n  \nThe d\u00e9cor and vibe seem a little unpolished. Like the aesthetic concept was half baked. I'm not sure if this is the owner's first restaurant, but it needs to come together a bit. It kind of feels like eating inside the shell of a former restaurant.\n\nThese criticisms are all easily fixable. They are new, so they have time to get it all resolved. I'll be back for a follow up review, mainly to try some of the sandwiches as they looked delicious. If they can work it all out and maintain the food quality, I predict good things in the future."

I had hoped that after one bad experience when they first opened that the next would be a little better... It certainly was not. I then hoped that by waiting six months to try again, it'd be better... it was the worst, and on Mother's Day to boot! The real shame is that the it was not solely the service staff to blame - the owner/manager/chef situation must be the root cause.  Each time we've been, they ran out of ridiculous items... Once it was champagne AFTER we had ordered their bottomless mimosas... Another time it was tomato juice when I asked for a bloody Mary, and every time they had run out of kat least two things from the menu - and instead of letting you know upfront, the server went back-and-forth from either the bar or the kitchen to tell you that they were out of it and try something else. On two of the three occasions, food wasn't brought out for over 45 minutes... and that was just for one of us... everyone else had to wait 10-20 minutes for their meals, thereafter. So much for \"wait until everyone\" is served etiquette. We had only been offered an apology one of those three times, and it from a bystanding hostess. The sad thing is that I pride myself on not being overreactive when it comes to poor restaurant experiences... I've vowed never to leave a bad online review before attempting first to speak with the owners about any problems. I tried THREE TIMES via three different methods... in person at the restaurant (she was busy in the kitchen and unavailable), an email, and through instagram inbox - all three resulted in zero response. There aren't many restaurants like this one in the area so we were so excited when they opened, but it seems useless now. They have stolen my time and money and ruined a part of my day for the last time. Customer beware! \"Catahoula's\" is a few blocks away and they do great New Orleans style food too!"

One of those opportunities left up to the cosmic workings of the universe. What a way to end an evening. \n\nThere were two people sitting at the bar as we walked in and Sean said take a seat. We knew (or figured) they were closing but he just welcomed us with open arms. Originally the plan was to just get drinks. The possibility of grabbing a bit to eat was intriguing and honestly needed after the long night of drinking but the surprise we were in for was quite a treat. \n\nWe grab drinks. Nothing serious considering we were trying to be considerate of the hospitality, just a few beers. Sean said he had Abita and I hopped (no pun intended) right on it. That sparked the beginning of our convo. They have quite a few styles of beer from Abita that you might not be able to find in the city and for me Abita is a staple. Great flavors, not too strong but full bodied. Whenever I can grab my hands on some, I will. Shortly after ordering the other patrons left and we had Sean to ourselves. \n\nWe talked about his history in the food industry, Canada, him attending the Wharton School of Business, New York, New Orleans, Food, you name it. Long story short Sean is not only the Chef but the owner of Acadia. Being the man of many hats his passion truly shined through last night. He didn't care that we were the last customers after the restaurant had technically closed. He wanted to show us his love for food and we allowed him to do just that. \n\nHe went into the kitchen and whipped us up some dishes to eat. The first of which being an appetizer of Oysters, followed by dessert (Banana Pudding). This man didn't have to do any of this yet he did and my heart, stomach and consciousness will forever be indebted to Sean Nevins. If we had more time we would have had him cook anything he wanted but we didn't hold him hostage for much longer after dessert. \n\nI don't care what you think you know about food or perhaps your liking of certain dishes and cuisines, get your butts over to Acadia."

I had pretty high hopes when I finally got the chance to go, but I left only half as excited as when I arrived.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started off with the free cornbread, sliders, and fries. The cornbread was pretty good, being a little on the drier side which I appreciate, plus the butter was oddly really good. The sliders kind of stole the show in my opinion, even though it's just ground beef. The fries were really well seasoned too!\n\nFor entrees, he got the Chicken and Andouille Gumbo and I got the Creole Jambalaya. I was a little thrown off since the shrimp in the jambalaya was more of a garnish than anything. The rice itself was pretty dry and needed salt, but I revived it as much as I could. His gumbo definitely won in terms of flavor, but neither of us were wildly impressed.\n\nThe beignets, which were -pretty much- the only reason I really wanted to come, fell a little short for me. They're definitely smaller than other ones I've had before, but at least they tasted nice.\n\nI would definitely come back to see if it was just an off day since I really want this place to be good!"
