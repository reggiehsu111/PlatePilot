It was hot coffee poured over ice, watering down coffee and leaving it room temp without ice. \n\nI'll still be back, but will make my own iced coffee ahead of time. Also note their business hours are incorrect. The close at 4pm."

I admit that I am a bagel snob, so while this bagel was leagues better than what you would get in a super market, there are far better bagel options in the city. It was doughy enough, but it needed a bit more of a crust. I ate two before deciding. I will try again, but I left just a bit underwhelmed. For the 95% who aren't bagel snobs, this is place is great."

Small shop vibe with very friendly cashier. I got the double egg and cheese and it was freshly cooked in front of me in a matter of minutes. \n\nThanks guys"

I enjoyed the food, but was a little pissed that my bagel had lox spread on it and not full lox like the photo showed. Additionally, I ordered coffee and they threw straws in the bag WITHOUT PAPER on them, kinda gross. Maybe an Uber Eats thing idk. Something to figure out next time. Again, the food was fine, but may have to try it in person. Thanks NY Bagel for making my rainy Sunday relaxing though!!"

They give you a real NY-sized schmear of cream cheese on your bagel; everything about this place is delightful if you're a nostalgic ex-New Yorker like me, or if you're just looking for an excellent fast breakfast sammy. \n\nThe location is mid-block on Buttonwood, between 12th and Ridge."

The breakfast potatoes are your typical breakfast potatoes, nothing special, but they do shell out a hefty portion! Only issue was I ordered an everything bagel, and I believe they must've run out, but I wasn't notified, and I realized once I was home that my bagel was whole grain. Not a big deal, the bagel was delicious anyway!"

But some people shouldn't run bagel shops.\n\nIt would have been great! It's in a location without a lot of food options. Everybody loves breakfast food. What's not to love, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nBecause of my background I may have a high standard for bagels but this place falls way short of average in my opinion. I ordered the lox spread on my bagel. If I were to give an award for the smallest amount of lox in lox spread, it would go to this place. There was also just not enough cream cheese. Sometimes I have the problem where there's too much, but not enough? Come on. It's not that expensive. Also, I asked for lettuce and tomato on my bagel which they charged me extra for before giving me one piece of the world's smallest lettuce and most thinly sliced tomato.my mediocre bagel with pitiful amounts of lox spread, lettuce, and tomato was more than $5.\n\nI tried it again.\n\nI got the Cobb salad. It was like $9. I would honestly expect a portion size that was like 3x bigger than mine was. I was so disappointed. I give this place three stars for their location and convenience but as far as my satisfaction with it goes, I am disappointed."

Definitely a hearty load of meat, eggs and cheese. \n\nMy boyfriend got a simple breakfast platter (2 eggs any style with toast and a meat on the side). \n\nService was extremely fast (food was ready within minutes) and they accept card!\n\nI would definitely visit again! It's an easy stop-and-go styled establishment that is reminiscent of a convenient NY bagel shop!"

I always get a breakfast sandwich, hash browns, and iced coffee. My food is always hot and delicious when it arrives and they pack it so carefully.\n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are GOOD. Bagels aren't spectacular but for the price and speed I think they kill it. A sign of a good breakfast sandwich to me is the meltiness of the cheese and every time it's perfect.\n\nSuch a lovely little spot with yummy food, you can't go wrong."

It is located a short drive from where I live, but it's on the way home from a friend's house so it's perfect for drives to and from in the morning after a night out. \n\nThe bagels are delicious. I've tried a variety of bagel offerings including their breakfast sandwiches, which have generous portions of egg and meat.

Seven of the bagels were rock hard and clearly not made today. When I called to let them know I was told that they opened at 7am and all bagels were freshly made. And no solution was offered aside from apologies. If you order butter it is small, individual packets of butter. The other 6 bagels were ok, not the best I've had but they were at least soft.

Due to this I thought I'd update my thoughts in a review. For one thing the sandwiches are a lot better (NOT ALL, UNFORTUNATELY).They're tastier & slightly bigger. The coffee which I had when the shop had recently opened wasn't good at all. I was surprised about that as though the sandwiches were slightly above average only I wasn't expecting the coffee to be bad. The next time I was willing to give their coffee a second shot was this spring (2021). It was really good that day as well as the following 3-4 times I had it. I should note I was also pretty happy  at the time the coffee was cheaper than Elixr's Coffee (another nearby shop to me, at the time).It was something like $2.35 (I can't recall the exact charge anymore). One day I came with my 18 oz mug I always bring so our landfills \nwon't have to be filled with more disposed of coffee rubbish paraphernalia. When the lady I hadn't seen before charged me $2.70 I reckoned she'd just made a mistake. When I said something about her figure she said my cup was a large so that's why I was being charged that amount. Following this I continued to get my coffee here but for some reason it had gotten worse, more bitter. \nI was going to give 4 stars prior to the coffee I got here 10/19/21 & the two egg sandwiches I ordered 11/6/21 (see pictures from that)but decided on three due to the shop's inconsistency.  The workers there, having said all that (I'm assuming they're the owners. I don't know \u200d)are nice hard working souls."
