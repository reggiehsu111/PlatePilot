We ordered papaya salad, triple flavor duck, and king tofu soup. Papaya salad is always refreshing, but this place overdoes it on the fish sauce. Anything triple flavor is always a safe but delicious choice. I would say their king soup, with choice of protein, is a winner. \n\nAnd also, BYO!"

It's slowly becoming my undisputed go to restaurant when I'm philly!   Also heard from a patron that Uber eats started delivering.    Wish I lived closer so I could enjoy more frequently.    Absolutely one of my favorite spots for a good meal!"

The service on Friday nights is fantastic.  \n\nOver the years, the cooking has improved and is tastier than ever.  It's hard to get a seat, so plan on waiting 30 minutes on a busy night - that being said, it's not long until you are seated and promptly given water and they have real candles here.  \n\nI always order the coconut soup (I order it with the tofu \"not fried\") and also the yellow curry with tofu - also not fried.  It lends a more delicate flavor to the already rich curry.  It is to die for - tastes like dessert.  It is served with rice.\n\nLast time I ordered the Pho - my goodness, the bowl is so huge and served with two sauces - hoisin and siracha.  Very good and filling - I would order it next time with more veggies (they are very good at helping you with special orders)\n\nThis is a BYOB and the prices can't be beat.  The menu keeps getting larger and I only wish I were closer to this place, as I would come here weekly for sure!"

Embarrassing.\n\nI had the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) which were delicious. Though the menu said they'd be spicy, and they didn't even have a slow burn thing going on. Next time, I would get it spicier. Lots of beef in it though, they definitely did not skimp on that.\n\nMy parents both ate Pad Thai and loved it. I snagged a bite of my mom's Chicken Pad Thai and it was pretty yummy. I prefer greasy spicy noodles though.\n\nThe desserts here are so so good. A bit overpriced maybe ($6 a piece), but delicious. I had the sticky mango rice, my mother ate the chocolate banana egg roll, my brother had the banana tempura. All yummy.  My dad clearly made the right choice when he ordered the coconut ice cream. It came in half a coconut and there was SO MUCH ICE CREAM. I dont' know if they make it on location, or if they get it elsewhere, but I could definitely eat it every day.\n\nI'm going to drag my brother here for the rest of the time he's at UPenn.

I checked the doorway on the way out - nope, no sign. There was nothing on the check to indicate they were cash-only, I don't remember seeing it listed on the menu (and I look for these things!) While dinner was delicious, that is a customer service fail that left me less-than-impressed. \n\nUp to that point, though, I very much enjoyed my dinner here. We started by sharing an order of spring rolls, two large rolls were served cut in half which was a nice portion for sharing. The peanut sauce they are served with is delicious! I had the panang curry -always delicious, although not anything particularly innovative. My friends had the pineapple fried rice (I had a taste - again, good but nothing mind-blowing) and sweet basil chicken (this is something I had never tasted before - yum!). Portion sizes were generous and the prices are reasonable. Service was OK - there was a long wait between appetizer and entrees, and for a while our water glasses were very neglected. \n\nThey would have gotten 4 stars had it not been for their poor advertising of the cash-only policy. If you like Thai food they're worth a visit, just make sure to hit up the ATM before you head in!"

The dessert I had (can't remember what it was) was absolutely disgusting.\n\nAfter reading all the positive yelp reviews, we went back last night to give it a second chance. Thai iced teas were great. The crispy pork spring rolls were delicious, with a great pork flavor (though the crispy spring rolls at Vietnam Cafe are similar and much better). The grilled mixed vegetables with peanut sauce were bland, but the peanut sauce was excellent. I bet the chicken satay is good.  \n\nWe were really thinking that we were in for a good dinner until the entrees came. Not only did it take FOREVER for our entrees to come, but they were terrible! We got the pad thai (again, to see if it would be better), but it was exactly the same: bland. Pad Thai is supposed to burst with the flavors of tamarind, fish sauce, bean sprouts, and peanuts. This didn't burst at all.  After reading great things about the crazy pineapple fried rice, I went for it, but it was bad too: the pineapple was absolutely delicious, but didn't go well with the flavor of the fried rice, which was bland and vaguely unpleasant.\n\nWe paid $50 with tip for 2 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 thai iced teas. \n\nAs we left, I suggested we only come here again for appetizers. We decided to just not come again.\n\nMake the trek out to Silk Cuisine in Bryn Mawr! Best Thai in the area, hands down."

Ugh!!!)\n\nRegardless of their failure to supply me with my necessary protein intake, I still really enjoyed my meal.  We started with the papaya and cucumber salad which was delicate and at the same time complex.  Then I had veggie pineapple fried rice and asked them to load up on the veggies because of the tofu outage.  They obliged, and the plate was delicious.  I got spice level 4/5 and didn't find it very spicy, but I may just have a high spice tolerance.\n\nFor dessert we had the mango sticky rice and chocolate banana fried something or another... Both were delicious.  The mango sticky rice had slices of fresh mango with coconut topping.  \n\nI will be back.  And hopefully they will have what I order."

        "text": "Deciding to come to the Vientiane Cafe, a Laotian/Thai restaurant, was a pretty easy choice after hearing a positive review about it from a friend. The only difficult part to getting out here would be convincing my other friends that it would be worth the short trek from Penn's campus. Always looking to explore affordable options outside of Penn's standard offerings, I finally got a small group to come out to try the place on a slow weekend.\n\nThe Vientiane has a small storefront located along a row of other randomly put-together offerings, including a record store and a Chinese take-out restaurant. Upon entering the restaurant, there was a sense of warmth and community as the waiters and kitchen hummed along and the diners happily focused on their food and conversation. Stepping in from the chilly walk and the proximity of the other tables certainly helped set the mood too.\n\nLuckily for us, we came just in time to snag the last available table. Promptly after we arrived, a small line began to form outside. As a side note, it's probably better to come a bit earlier for dinner because the restaurant only has seating for about 20-25 people.\n\nThe prices for entrees, about $8-$12 for most items, were in-line with what I was expecting and were pretty well-sized. We tried to order more Laos-influenced and less commonplace Thai dishes. We ended up sharing 4 entrees--homemade sausage, laab, sweet basil with chicken, and a pineapple fried rice--and stick rice, figuratively the \"glue\" to this meal as it absorbed the delicious sauce. The sticky rice came in these cool, little Laotian rice baskets which were used for steaming the rice. I'm sure the rice baskets are commonplace, but I was really excited to see them (*note to self: must get out more).\n\nAfter the meal, we were all quite satiated and satisfied with our meal, including the bill, which came to roughly $15 per person (all-inclusive).\nFor my first foray into Laotian cuisine, I was happy with the experience. Compared to other Asian cuisines, there was greater use of mint, cilantro and spices to bring out the flavor in the meat dishes. My favorite was the laab dish, a warm minced meat salad served with chilis and mint. It is allegedly  also the unofficial national dish of Laos (I'm always amused where Wikipedia sources their information when there are no footnotes).\n\nI would definitely come back for a lunch or dinner with a small group of friends."

I was hoping it'll taste authentic, but I guess they made it more Americanized which is kind of understanding. I ordered the papaya salad (thum ma hoong) for appetizer, it tasted okay... Down side was that it was too plain for me, didn't really taste like the flavor I was hoping for.  The pad see ew was also so flavorless, I wanted to get a taste of toasty-ness from the noodles. Lastly, the desert. I ordered the sweet mango sticky rice which is my favorite Thai desert ever and I was really upset with this one. The sticky rice was more on the soggy side than sticky side. The coconut cream was just slapped on top of the sticky rice which I don't know why because it's suppose to be mixed together with the sticky rice. Also the mango wasn't ripe, it was hard & not as sweet as it should be. The only thing that pleased me was the beef jerky (seen hang), it was really chewy & flavorful with seasoning & a side of a sweet spicy tangy sauce which made it taste 10x better. Although, the food wasn't to my likings, the service & the environment was great & soothing. Which was the reason for the 3 stars. Friendly staff, but horrible food."

Mines was spicy but not red spicy; rather, the \"Aw Laos\" dish was flavourful with dill and other veggies in a beautiful stewlike concoction. Comes with sticky rice. Definitely recommend this particular Laotian dish. Desserts were nothing too spectactular--fellow diners ordered mango with sticky rice and a coconut-agar dessert. No wows but a complacent recognition by my friends. Atmosphere is nice, for date or with group of friends. Worth checking out. Seems a reliable staple in this part of the woods.

The look of the restaurant from outside was deceiving where we almost left after we arrived because of the location, parking situation, and my fear of not being used to the type of surroundings. When we walked in we were surprised by how warm, cozy, clean, filled with customers, and we were greeted and seated promptly. It didn't take long for us to get our food and the food was very $reasonable. We ordered the sticky rice, chicken larb, papaya salad, beef jerky, stick rice mango dessert and all we delicious. We enjoyed all but probably will not order the sticky rice mango dessert again for $8 although we didn't mind paying for it considering the cost of how much it would have taken for them to make it but it was just a little too watering for us. We would definitely do it again next time we visit Philadelphia since we don't have any Laotian restaurants in Tampa area. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who likes to try authentic Laotian food that cannot be found from Thai restaurants.

The tofu satay was perfectly made, and the vegetarian spring rolls were really tasty.  Dessert included nibbles of coconut ice cream, a fried chocolate banana and the sticky mango rice.  I highly recommend the coconut ice cream.  Sticky mango is one of my favorite treats, and this was excellent. But the friend banana was pretty close to what I have had elsewhere (except I never had friend banana with a splash of chocolate tlike this). \n\nAs to other issues, here is the run down: parking was available in a nearby free parking lot; the wait service was friendly and service was quick; the atmosphere was perfect for quiet two-person conversation and large group atmosphere; and the prices were moderate.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant."

Not only do you always provide an affordable meal that all seem to enjoy - you are consistent, every dish is made to order, and OMG can you accommodate all food preferences!\n\n\nThis visit is bitter-sweet, as I am departing the Philadelphia area for a new career opportunity.\n\nWhile I know I will be back from time-to-time, as I do have family in the area, I still can't just pop on over to one of my favorites when I need a good friend's couch to sit on. Because of all realistic measures, that is exactly what Vientiane is - a good friend's couch that you can come hang out in a laid back and chilled BYOB atmosphere.\n\n\nIt's that friend that makes you that big bowl of comfort food to help you celebrate the highs or to crush to lows... and for all of the amazing experiences I have had here - I thank you! I thank you for making eating out and being social a possibility for a gal who has multiple food allergies, is a bit of a food snob, and living on a budget. You are amazing and I will continue to spread the word that all of Philadelphia needs to come check out Vientiane, if they have not already!\n\n\nThis evening, we were seated and handed the revamp menu - which, is visually much more appealing. It is also helpful that this menu consists of GF (gluten-free) codes so I know what is and is not safe for me.\n\n\nI ordered a good classic for a table share - Lao Porridge (jow-piek) or congee. It is a smooth and comforting bowl of heaven - not too many more ways to explain it.  It is a subtle dish with simple flavors meant to heal. Good thing I planned on sharing and that I ordered the large because the entire table went nuts over it. P.S I order it with the soft tofu rather than fried - it is just a preference, but I think it makes a world of difference.\n\n\nThen, despite having a huge list of things I wanted to try (aka the casserole, Laab, any of their fried rice dishes, Banh-Xeo, a dessert, and more.....) I had to go out with the first dish I ever ordered.......\n\n\nDrum roll please..... the King Soup - or as I like to describe it as a Pho with coconut milk and much more spice! We all know I love coconut, love a creamy dish, and we LOVE spice - so win was always written all over this dish! Oh, and did I mention that they can make it gluten-free, vegan and it comes in a GIANT bowl for under 15!?\n\n\nA friend of mine did order the new dish, Bamboo Stew (gang-naw-mai) which is bamboo shoots mixed with pumpkin and mushrooms (very earthy) and served with their famous sticky rice. Note, while this dish is not marked gluten-free, I am sure that if you ask, they are able to modify it for us gluten-free folks! \n\n\nIn conclusion, it has been real Vientiane Cafe and I will certainly be back to visit! In the meantime, keep making some more awesome additions to your menu and oh, if any of my readers try the other dishes on my wish list, PLEASE SEND ME REVIEWS!\n\n\nUntil next time.\n\n\nOh, and check out all my other reviews of Vientiane Cafe below:\nhttp://gf-flamingo.blogspot.com/"

La Na -- amazing dish, even better cold the next day! All their egg noodle dishes are especially delicious, though it's hard to outshine their Penang curry. Also, appetizers, wow. So fresh -- the veggies the sauces! And then...dessert. Best mango sticky rice ever. Best rice pudding. Chocolate banana spring rolls. Truly fantastic. (Also BYOB, with no corking fees!)\n\nThe spot itself is a bit out of the way for me, but there's a lot nearby, and it's not so bad a walk from CC in the end. Inside, it's cute, quaint and often packed, especially on weekends -- and they don't take reservations for parties fewer than 6. Final warning: cash only."

Recomend the laos style papaya salad, (made correctly with fermented fish), beef jerky, larb nuea.   We didn't order from the menu, we just told the one of the owners what we wanted, a mixture of Thai and Laos dishes, delicious(seap) and a good value. Couple that with BYOB, outside table service, it makes for great dining experience.  The service comes straight from the owners, with warmth and from the heart. If you are weary of self-important posers that wait on you in other resaurants, then head here. Tired of watered down Asian food, then head to Vientiane Cafe. \n\n My wife was born near Vientiane and has a culinary degree from Suan Dusit in Thailand, and she was so happy that I brought her here, because after a year, we finally found a restaurant that has  food that is as good as what we can make at home!"

A good place for a first date I guess, when you are too nervous to think about the quality of your food. It's also on a trendy, up-and-coming block in West Philly, so that might add to the popularity.\nThe food was simply average, the prices too high, and service almost non-existent. I was very disappointed in this place and won't go back.\nI went there for lunch and got to the point where I started to wonder if the waiter had forgotten about me, and the other customers waiting. The soup was too salty, the dumplings too doughy and without enough \"stuff\" in them to give them flavor, and the chicken basil was too dry. The veggies just average. Since I mentioned the chicken basil I should add it wasn't even what I ordered. I ordered the shrimp. I didn't say anything, because a.) I was really indifferent about which of the four (veggie, shrimp, beef, chicken) I got, and b.) I didn't want it to be a hassle, and I certainly didn't want the wait to be even longer. So I didn't say anything. At the end, the waiter realized he gave me the wrong dish, and took 10% off the chicken price. Whatever. Had he appeared while I was eating to either refill my water, or ask me how my lunch was I would have said something and added, \"no biggie, just don't charge me the higher shrimp price\".\nMistakes happen, no problem. \nThe prices are a few bucks higher than what they should be. If this place was in some generic suburban strip mall, I think most of the positive reviewers would trash this place, but since it is in a hipster neighborhood people say it's great. Sort of like the Seinfeld episode where George convinces attractive models that he once dated a now-deceased fellow model and thus gets \"in the club\". Women looked at George and said \"well, since he dated one of us he must be a stud\". Same deal here, put a place in a cool neighborhood and somehow people think the food tastes better. \nOne last thing, this place does NOT take credit cards. Be warned. Don't get how in 2014 restaurants don't take credit cards."

I had the chicken satay app with the red curry chicken, and found both to be very good.  The satay was juicy and flavorful with a great peanut dipping sauce, and the curry was very solid although it wasn't very spicy.  I also had a few bites of the triple flavor tilapia in the sweet and sour sauce, and really like the crispy, pan-seared fillet combined with the garlicky sauce.  Will definitely have to get this next time.  Most restaurants like to fry the fillet when they make a sweet and sour dish but pan searing actually brings out the flavor more and gives that delicious crispy exterior without killing your arteries.  We finished off with the mango sticky rice and coconut rice pudding.  While the mango sticky rice was very good, I liked the coconut rice pudding more because I love all things coconut and this was a delicious coconut-based concoction.  If you are in the area this week, and need to grab a bite, definitely stop in for the $15 dining days special.  It's a great deal and the food is very good.  They also have homemade beef jerky at $6/order, which I couldn't resist getting to-go; while it wasn't as fantastic as my aunt's homemade jerky, the meat was very well-marinated and flavorful and great paired with the accompanying chili paste.  The ambiance is very cozy and the unique curry soup bowls add a nice touch.  Service was friendly but we did have to ask for water refills a few times."

I have found that, unless you specify that you want it very hot, though, that the food will come out mild.

My opportunity came when my friend wanted to \"go out\" to celebrate her completion of the bar exam that day.  At first I thought she meant \"go out\" like to a crowded bar somewhere downtown but when her husband explained that we were going to Vientiane Cafe I was more than happy to tag along.  I think one of the reasons I had never gone there was that it doesn't look like anything special from the outside, so I was surprised to see just how large it was inside when we got there.  The ambiance was nice.  I felt like we could be ourselves, talking about the \"bag lady\" at the bar, and be boisterous without being awkward.  But it was still quiet enough to enjoy a more relaxing meal.  \n\nWe had a group of 7 of us and they easily and quickly accommodated us.

I really don't know how they made it so good but it was SO good.  It makes me mouth water just thinking about it now.  One thing I will say, though, is that the spice levels really don't matter at all.  The have a scale of 1 to 5 with 5 being the spiciest.  I got a 4 and most of the others got 2, however they all tasted the same, which was not so spicy.  Normally I would have been really upset that it wasn't very spicy but the flavor was so good I didn't even care.\n\nOn the downside, prices were pretty high and the service was only so-so.

I ordered the Green Curry, and it can be described as a few carrots and broccoli stems floating around in a soup of watered down coconut milk. \n\nWith tax and tip my bill was $18, and I don't see any reason to go back. As my friend said at the end of our meal: \"The search for a half decent Thai restaurant in Philly continues.\""

The Tom Yom soup was not the correct flavor I have had before, but all of the dishes were very very fresh beautiful ingredients.  Dumplings and spring rolls were excellent..  Everything was just a little too bland for Thai, but on the other hand that made everything accessible to my kids.  It was very reasonably priced, especially for Thai.  Love the BYOB and they even brought me the right kind of glasses for my booze.  Very friendly staff.  I plan on going back without my kids and asking them to kick it up a notch and see what happens.  Maybe they can get me to fork over another star."

Papaya Salad, is probably my favorite food...ever. There is the Nam salad (vegetarian) and the Yum salad, which I get with beef that is also very very flavorful and delicious. My favorite entree there is the Pad Kee Mao, similar to the Pad Thai, but it is flat rice noodles with more flavor (in my opinion). \n\nMore perks: friendly staff, BYOB, perfect place for a date. :)"

Now we both feel very strongly about pizza-it's easy and almost always delicious. But I'm glad we decided on dinner at Vientiane Cafe because it reminded me that it's probably my favorite Thai restaurant in town.\n\nI'll mention that I love that this restaurant is especially friendly to vegetarians, which is likely a calculating move given its location in the transition zone from University City and West Philly. The service was just the tiniest bit slow, but nothing egregious. After all, Friday night is bound to be busy. We got the Tofu Skewers for appetizers (4 perfectly grilled slabs of Tofu) and  the Green Curry and King Soup for entrees.\n\nSince we're both suckers for fever-inducing food, we were slightly disappointed that the Green Curry, which was marked with their highest spice rating, didn't register a temperature for us. Which is not to say it wasn't flavorful. The King Soup was, well, majestic. The curry-coconut broth was rich and chock full of noodles, bean sprouts, cabbage and adorned with the perfectly crispy-soft pieces of tofu. \n\nThe wait staff, while not overly attentive, was prompt in responding to our various requests during the meal. A final note is that the place is cash only!"

I love the remodel they did awhile back! Their King's soup knocks my socks off. Their fresh and fried spring rolls are also really great (i've not tried the duck). Love their coconut soup.  Love their tamarind wings. Love their pad se ew. The Thai cut fish is also delicious. Good atmosphere and they let you relax and hang out with your friends & enjoy your meal instead of rushing you out the door.\n\nReasons I didn't give 5 stars: The last time I came in there was a strange smell in the dining room area.  :/  I brought someone here after talking it up and everything he got truly wasn't great. The chicken satay was really small and tasted of fish. The service was very nice but we were seated way in the far back corner and there were long periods of time where no one checked on us. His food wasn't spicy at all and he asked for 4/5 spice level. I ate it and I was fine with it--normally a 4/5 spice level would kill me. He got a bad bite of something in his salad and these things combined ruined the dining experience for us both.\n\nWill judge on the whole and not this one time, but I hope that this was a one-off.

We ordered two apps to share and an entree each. One app came soon, the other 20 minutes later. Barely minutes after the 2nd app arrived and we were still enjoying it (or trying to), one entree arrive, just one. A full five minutes later, as entree 1 gets cold (since my companion is gracious enough not to start without me), still no other entree. Waitress rushes by, we manage to catch her eye and ask where other entree is. She says she'll check, but after five minutes more hasn't come back. I get up from table and go to find out. Waitress sees me and look of \"uh-oh\" comes onto her face because she obviously forgot all about it. She gestures toward manager who starts to give me all sorts of excuses -- \"we're so busy, kitchen got backed up, it will be out soon\" -- and I say, well, yes, but my companion's dinner is now cold. So she says they'll bring him a new one along with mine. Which she herself does after a few more minutes but then slams it down onto our table, literally slams it down onto the table without a word of apology, no smile, no nothing -- and, by the way, no fork, since the waitress had cleared our forks with the apps. Meanwhile, our empty beer bottles sit on the table throughout the meal, as no staff have the sense to take them away, and a grimy, dirty candle-holder sits there, too, because, when we finally ask about a candle, we're told \"we ran out.\" So, I figure you either walk a block to the dollar store nearby and buy some candles or you take the yucky candle holders off the tables.\n\nAll in a lousy experience. When entrees finally came, they were adequate, nothing special, same for the apps.

Standard options such as noodles, rice, curries and vegetable stir fries accompanied by your choice of meat, tofu or more veggies abound. No one will leave disappointed...even if they only eat the sticky rice. Because everybody loves perfect sticky rice.\n\nThe green papaya salad is scrumptious, even without peanuts.

        "text": "To be clear, I'd give this place 2.8 stars.\n\nStaff was friendly and we got seated quickly despite that the place was full. Oh, it's CASH ONLY. We ordered the Vegetarian Naam Salad. The texture was good (good, as in \"expected, because I've eaten this before\" good). The flavor was...actually, unremarkable (but not bad at all, to be clear). To be fair, naam khao is normally a favored dish for me and my friends...so an unexpected unremarkable flavor also means a heightened sense of disappointment. If you have had really good naam khao, this dish is like naam khao that your cousin makes when they're lazy...because it's crunchy and chewy and tart, but missing the salty and sweet flavors. You will need more lettuce too. We also ordered the homemade jerky; it was fine. Fine as in, it's not bad at all, tasted like soy sauce...but it's not ::shrugs:: good like the jerky that you get at the Lao temple during the New Year's good. Last, we got the pork laab (instead of beef laab since we didn't bring a lot of cash, we thought we'd save $1 with this option). We ordered medium spicy (I think) and I thought it was definitely \"butt burn\" spicy level. Actually, I think we ordered medium spicy and then asked for chilly on the sides...whatever, it wasn't the complex type of flavor that you normally get with laab anyway. It was just spicy (as my friend said, \"one note\"). We got a teeny tiny, looks like kid-sized portion of sticky rice to share among three adults with the laab. Well, dang, we had to take really small bites of our sticky rice to make it last...but the proportion of sticky rice to laab wasn't really appropriate. Oh, all the herbs and greens and stuff tasted fresh. \n\nThat's all I can remember. Now...with all that said, I feel like this is a good place to eat if you haven't really eaten all that much Lao or Thai food and would like a tidy introduction to basic flavors of the dishes I have mentioned above. There are a lot of other things to try on the menu too."

Based on the over-the-top reviews, I gave it two tries over three days:  once dining-in on a Wed night; once carry-out Fri night.  Neither time blew my mind, and I did get the much-praised King Soup.  It was fine, but I literally had a better version of it last spring in a middling Thai place in Lincoln Nebraska, so that's kind of telling.\n\n1)  The food seems v. fresh, so that's great.  It's also on the pricey side, so I would actually expect it to be more mind-blowing.\n\n2)  WAY TOO LOUD.  Be prepared to face a Wall Of Noise when eating at Vientiane, and to shout at your dining companions - there is no other way.  \n\n3)  They're understaffed:  service is friendly enough, but very haphazard (it took multiple tries to get anyone's attention for things like extra napkins or a wine glass).  On the rare occasion that we saw an employee, they seemed feverishly consumed with what they were doing - to the point that they expressly avoided looking around at any surrounding tables to check if they might need anything.  Food is pretty slow -- again, this would be fine if I thought it were really spectacular - I just don't think it is.  Def. won't be hurrying back, and will actively avoid the dinner rush.

The dinner crowd is often a big one with long wait times, but lunch is usually quieter & you get your pick of tables. When it's nice out, sitting at one of the outside tables is lovely.\nTheir dinner prices are a bit high, though the food is good quality. Also, their crispy noodle salad is *technically* a salad because it has a sprinkling of scallions and a sprig of greenery, but mostly it's tasty sauce and little fried noodles. Not something to order if you're trying to be health-conscious.\nTheir lunch special is a moderately-priced three course meal, consisting of a soup, an appetizer, and the main course. Each category has several options. I prefer the coconut soup, which is creamy and tangy, with a nice assortment of veggies, though I'm not a fan of the peppers. The dumpling appetizer is not very good. Although the dipping sauce is just right, the dumplings are kind of chalky and bland. I suggest the fresh spring roll with strips of fried tofu and two dipping sauces instead. The entrees offered are mainly curry variants, as well as pad thai and a few other things. I enjoy their pad thai a lot, and it's good with beef and great with chicken. \nI'm giving them three stars due to a few unpleasant incidents, one opf which I'll detail. We were waiting to have dinner for a while, and we'd left and come back to kill some time. The waitress had said 20-ish minutes, so we were back in that time. We waited some more, and then we got seated by one waitress. Unfortunately, a moment later, another waitress unseated us and told us we'd have to wait at least another 20 minutes, if not more. Needless to say, we were rather disgruntled. The waitstaff should really be more coordinated and communicative on busy nights. And long story short, we went home and got delivery."

Well it had one star written next to it.\n\nI have no idea why.  But they will not sell us spicy food.  This is not just once, it is endemic.  Fans of spicy food, do not frequent this place.  I know I will not."

They have a great lunch special where you get soup, an appetizer, and an entree for about $9. \n\nThe Pad Thai and fresh spring rolls are excellent. I also recommend any of the curry dishes with tofu. The pho was a little lackluster but I chalk that up to the vegetarian broth. Portions are large, so I normally have to bring half home. \n\nThey have nice outdoor seating in the summer. There's also a free city parking lot right around the corner if you can't take Septa.

I've lived in the neighborhood for almost five years, and have been here several times.  \n\nThe service: Very friendly, thorough, and fast. \n\nThe prices: Reasonable, though it has increased a little over the years. They also offer a lunch special - which includes an appetizer (love the fresh spring rolls), soup (LOVE the coconut soup), and entree (I frequent the curries with vegetables or shrimp) for a set price (comparable to the cost of just an entree at dinner) depending on your choice protein (tofu, chicken, shrimp, duck, and more). \n\nOther things to keep in mind: BYOB, cash only, they close between 3-5pm, and very allergy-friendly.  Gluten-free folks, you will have many options and the servers know what's up.\n\nGreat dishes: Yum Salad (a little spicy), Penang Curry (nice and peanut-y), Sweet Basil or Ginger Sauce entrees (really fresh flavors). \n\nAlso, of note, they serve the most delicious coconut ice cream in a coconut shell. with strawberries."

This bowl of soupy veggies did not have a hint or trace of anything resembling thai basil. Literally. None.

I totally get that lots of little cafes in West Philly don't take cards.

I had one before from Vientiane, as I did the Baltimore Ave stroll in August. Yum! It was light and tasted nice with the sauces it comes with. Then, my entree: I have always LOVED Thai noodle dishes. Nice fragrance and spices. Yum! The  Vegetarian Pad See Eiu  is chocked with veggies and Tofu. It has a nice flavor too.\n\nI am glad the restaurant is a mere couple of blocks from my apartment. \nIt was very good.

It's like Thai version of lettuce wrap but the stuffing is so crunchy and flavorful with a bit tangy and spicy kick. I'm obsessed! \n\nFor dinner, I got the green curry with chicken and it was divine. Texture of the chicken was prefect and the flavor was just amazing. I just wish that their sauce was a little creamier than watery, that's all. \nI'm already craving to come back here again, and I'll be sure to try their drunken noodles next time.\n\nUpdate after few more visit: I returned back and tried their drunken noodles and they're literally the best drunken noddles I ever had.

I was really excited because of the average rating of 4 stars on yelp, but I wasn't really a fan of Vientiane by the end. \n\nFood: \nThe naam salad was delicious, and the panang curry was pretty good, but they used a little too much oil -- I could see the oil separating from the curry on my plate. As for the mango sticky rice, they used a little too much coconut milk. The small mound of sticky rice was completely covered in the milk, rather than being well-balanced. Overall, I would give the food 3.5 stars.\n\nService:\nThis was where I detracted 1 star because I was pretty ok with the food at all, but the service was extremely slow. In addition, they messed up the dessert orders for both my friend and me, so I had to go to the front desk and wait for a waiter to come out to tell him of the mistake. In addition, the service didn't seem well-organized, as there were long periods of time in the back of the restaurant where a waiter did not even check in on the tables. I would be ok with this, except that the waiting time was inordinately long and that this was during Dining Days, where the restaurant should at least try to be at their best.\n\nOverall, go for a nice long (like 1.5 hour long or more) dinner, but if you're in a rush, skip."

Armed with two bottles of wine, the six of us enjoyed a filling dinner of delicious and cheap Thai and Laotian food that satisfied our hunger and kept our wallet light.\n\nI enjoyed the Lad Na with Beef, which is sort of like a Pad See Ew except with a slightly thinner sauce and more vegetables.  The broccoli was crisp, the beef was flavorful and juicy, and the noodles were done just right.  Everything in the dish worked perfectly together.  The BF and I also split a Nam Salad; some sort of lettuce wrap thing that tasted pretty good although I have no idea what the filling was (kind of reminded me of Bac-os?).  Not as good as the noodles in my opinion.\n\nThe service could have been slightly better (it took them forever to get us the wine glasses, although to their credit we were a large party and it was very crowded for the later side of a Friday night), but I was still very pleased with the food, ambiance, and overall value.  Definitely a place I would be happy to return to for a low-key dinner or even take out.  Also, at just under $20 per person with tax and tip included, it's extremely reasonable.

It was weird because the pad thai was obviously very well made but had almost no sweetness/tamarind taste which I was disappointed by. The green curry was only slightly spicy but still delicious! \n\nTook a star off because it was a little more pricey than Thai food tends to be for not a huge difference in quality... Maybe I should have tried the Laotian food instead - would definitely return for that!"

But beyond this, it was flavorful but not really amazing or anything.  It also wasn't very filling.\n\nI came back here in 2013 and...wow.  Just wow.  It was like a completely different restaurant...the food was really subtle and flavorful and completely unlike any Thai food I've had before.  I don't know if I hit it on an off day before, or if I ordered a dish better suited to my tastes the second time...but I've since come back, and tried quite a few different dishes here and it has been consistently top-notch.\n\nThis place is a little pricier than the average low-end restaurants that I like to eat at...it's hard to get out of here without spending $15 and it's easy to spend much more than that.  But I think the food is worth it.\n\nService was a little slow and inattentive the most recent time I came here.  I found that somewhat annoying.  But the food was so good that I'd totally keep coming back.  I've had lots of Thai food, and even some Lao food before, and I thought this was an unusually good restaurant of its type."

Now that I'm out in the mountains, I regret not taking advantage of it more than I did.\n\nLet's look at the cons, first:\nThey're small.  Kinda stuffy in the summer.  Fills up quick.  Waiting for a table outside during the winter sucks.  Inconsistent interpretations of their heat scale (I've had mild-medium that was a 5 alarm fire in my mouth, i've had medium that was just right.  I dunno, just guess.) \n\nBut the pros, oh, the pros.\nTheir fresh spring rolls. Squishy and chewy and full of mint and unicorns.  Maybe not really unicorns, but probably.  Actually better vegetarian than they are with meat.  Shrimp?  Whatever.  Get the tofu.\n\nThe soups.  Huge, unfinishable, delicious.  Just enough kick to warrant ordering 9 billion thai iced teas.  (did you know that you can get thai iced take as takeout?  I totally learned that here.)\n\nMy main course, every. Single. Time: Chicken Laarb.  I have never, in years of thai food, found another place that does laarb the way Vientiane does laarb.  Everywhere else, it's a weird vinegar-y appetizer salad thing, too sweet, kinda gross.  Here?  God, I don't know what they do here.  It's full of fish sauce and cilantro and lemongrass and scallions and magic fairy dust or something.  I would eat this for my last meal on earth.  Actually, I would eat the leftovers for my last night on earth.  (It's 100x better after it's been marinating in itself in the fridge overnight, and it's pretty damn perfect when it comes out of the kitchen.)\n\nDessert: does it even matter? Mango sticky rice, deep fried bananas, ice cream, who cares, it's gonna be delicious.\n\nI fly 2000 miles for this meal every 6 months.  Not even kidding."

It was quiet enough for talking and we were not rushed. \n\n I wanted to try the Laotian food since I have had plenty of Thai.  I had the \"Laah\" with chicken which I could describe as chopped chicken mixed with scallions, herbs and it was a little tart with lemon or lime juice. I would say it was interesting but I did not love it and would not order that again.  The laah came served with \"sticky rice\" which is just as it sounds. The rice came in a little bamboo container which was cute except that they lined the container with plastic to keep the bamboo clean.  I don't really like eating food in plastic.  \n\nThe rest of the group seemed to enjoy their food. The things that looked interesting to me were the King Soup (came in a giant bowl!) the Triple Flavored, and the papaya salad.\n\nThey offer an early bird special Mon-Thurs which comes with a small cup of soup, a few small satay skewers and a main dish for $15, a good deal, especially as it is BYOB.\n\nOverall I would say this is a decent place and probably one of the best options in a neighborhood not known for its cuisine. I would recommend it if you happen to be in the neighborhood but not if you have to make a special trip."

The pad Thai is also not to be missed. \n\nThe only reason I can't give this place five stars is because of how slow the service was. Granted, we were a large party...but the wait staff would sometimes disappear for 20-30 minutes at a time and it was over an hour and a half from the time I got there to the time I received my entree. \n\nBUT do not let the slow service stop you.

The decor is elegant yet comfortable. It's a lovely place to have a special but cozy dinner although it's is equally suited to working into your rotation of takeout places. The staff is knowledgeable and everything runs smoothly even on busy nights. \n\nThe food is terrific!!! Way better (more adventurous, more flavorful, less formulaic) than the other South East Asian option around the corner (cough cough, Vietnam Cafe). If you live in the area and are looking for something along the lines of Vietnamese or Laotian food, the only argument for going to Vietnam Cafe instead of Vientiane is the liquor license. Anyways...\n\nI frequently order a duck dish of some kind. It's clearly cooked by an experienced chef and is always super tasty. I love the way they cook their rice-- it's magically chewy without being too sticky. My husband loves their house-made beef jerky and their yum salads. We also LOVE their coconut puddings. Honestly, sometimes we do take out just for the coconut pudding; it's that good. \n\nIn sum; Vientiane is awesome. You should go."

At first I was taken back by the fishiness, but it kind of got addictive. I am Korean so I am used to spicy food, I think spice level 3 was a bit more spicy than I am used to. I have had spicier food, but I had rice to accompany the spicy food. Maybe next time I will adjust the spice level to 2 so I can enjoy some spice, but not have to blow my nose.

I ordered the rice pudding for dessert, expecting normal rice pudding, but it came in 4 little warm cups and was anything but normal, but decidedly delicious.

The curries are nice, very rich, flavorful, and spicy, but I didn't think they were a great value ($11). I do really like the sticky rice. My usual dining companion likes the beef and seafood red curries, but once ordered the Thai catfish and said that it was *horrible*, weirdly deep fried to death. He ate only 3 or 4 bites and couldn't stomach any more.\n\n I've never had lunch here, but dinner prices are not super cheap -- entrees are in the $11-$15 range. Tables are very close together, which occasionally leads to awkward moments because it is almost impossible to avoid overhearing other peoples' conversations and to avoid being similarly overheard by those at neighboring tables. Wait times can be a little long, but are generally bearable -- I've never had to stand around for more than 20 minutes.\n\n As busy as this place is, it's ridiculous that they don't accept cards...at the very least, they should post a prominent sign to warn people about their cash only policy."

I don't eat Mussels but I'm sure they're not supposed to be black).  I don't think it would stop us going back because every other time we've been the food has been excellent - we just wouldn't order mussels!\n\nThe hostess allowed him to order something else on the menu with no problems but... He ordered Pad Thai which was ok but not the best in the city.\n\nI ordered Aw Lao * soup (with sauteed lemongrass, shallots, chili, asian eggplant, dill: served with sticky rice, which was excellent.\n\nNeed to remember they only accept cash.\n\nLunch specials are also a great deal - soup, appetizer and main meal for less than $10.\n\nGreat vibe tonight though - the place was really busy and full of chatter."

The coconut soup was p good, although nothing really stood out- it was just a coconutty broth with veggies. The chicken satay were a bit dry, but still very flavorful- the sauce was perfect and really went well with the satay. \n\nI got the Panang curry medium spicy for my entree. All I can say is that it was alright. Spice level is as expected. My biggest complaint is that when it arrived, it looked like it was starting to separate into a layer of oil and a layer of lumpy inside. Still tasted pretty good, and they were generous with the beef so extra points for meat lovers. We got there at 1:30ish and there was no line, service was pretty fast also.

There are a few tiny tables on the sidewalk which could seat only 2 people each, so we had to sit inside.  The restaurant is very small, but it did not feel cramped to me.  Great ambience and great for a date or just a place to go with friends...my friends love that it's a byo, which one of the other good Thai places in University City, Thai Singa, is not.  Warnings: there is no AC and you must pay with cash.\n\nSo moving onto the food itself, I ordered the crispy pork spring roll, the chicken pad thai, and the mango sticky rice.  One friend ordered the chicken satay, the Paenang curry, and also the mango sticky rice.  My other friend ordered the green papaya salad, the stir-fried eggplant with chicken, and the banana chocolate spring roll.  The appetizers were all tiny: my spring roll was basically the size of a taquito, the chicken satay was only a few pieces of chicken on a skewer, and my friend's papaya salad had no papaya in it.  The entrees, however, were rather large and compensated for the bite-size appetizers.  By default, I always have to try the pad thai before making any judgment on a Thai restaurant.  I really enjoyed my pad thai here; it was flavorful and the chicken was very tender and moist.  My friends' entrees were not as good--both were so-so.  As for dessert, my friend's banana chocolate spring roll was delicious--perfectly pairing of crispy and mushy textures, and nice and warm.  My mango sticky rice was deconstructed, which was not how I have usually seen it, but it was pretty good (almost as good as the mango sticky rice from my favorite Thai restaurant at home!).  It was a little too flimsy though.  The Thai iced tea was also delicious, and I got it for free because I had to ask for it twice.\n\nI would definitely recommend checking this place out!  And be sure to have the guava candy they give you with the check. :)"

After living in Philly for over 6 years and loving Asian food, we finally made it over to West Philly and tried this BYOB, and all I will say is that we have gone back every week for 5 straight weeks. It's that good. And cheap. And did I mention, BYOB.\n\nFirst, my girlfriend is a vegetarian and this place is absolutely wonderful for her. If you know of the \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" on Cooking Channel, her choice for the Asian category is the Vegetarian Naam Salad. And let me tell you, as a meat eater, it is just so damn satisfying. They puff and crisp rice, and then serve it with lime, cilantro, peanuts, chili, and give you lettuce cups to use as a vessel to transport it from the plate to your mouth. The perfect blend of crunchy, salty, acidic, and spicy, we could eat it every day. And, it's healthy! \n\nFor the entrees, my girlfriend loves the King Soup with tofu. It's a red curry Thai-style broth, filled with rice noodles, tofu, bean sprouts, and some veggies. Perfect for a winter day. I would recommend the Laotian Sausages with sticky rice. They are homemade with lemongrass, chili, and other spices, and serviced with this amazing spicy acidic dipping sauce. Little rice, little sausage, and some dip, perfect bite. I look forward to continuing to try their Lao speciality dishes. \n\nFinally, they have all the \"normal\" Thai style noodles, curries, and rice dishes, and they truly are awesome, way better than the normal take out stuff you can get at all the \"normal\" Thai restaurants in the city.\n\nOverall, everything is delicious, the service is great, and it's BYOB. What else can you want? Do yourself a favor, make the drive from anywhere in the city to this West Philly gem. And enjoy!"

I had been looking for sweet sticky rice with mango at quite a few Thai restaurants, but the closest one I could find before I found Vientiane Cafe was Erawan, which is quite a distance away. The mango sticky rice was perfect; the coconut milk sweetened the sticky rice just enough and complemented the slightly tart mango slices perfectly. The sticky rice was warm and cooked perfectly--not too hard or too mushy.\n\nI also have tried Vientiane Cafe's papaya salad with anchovy sauce, as well as its sweet basil tofu dish. I liked them both equally. The papaya salad tasted different from papaya salads I've tried at other restaurants, but it was a good kind of different. The sweet basil tofu dish was flavorful. I expected there to be a ton of basil in the dish, but there actually were not very many basil leaves on my plate. I wouldn't mind more basil to be honest since I love basil, but I can see how having too many basil leaves could overpower the dish. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch here, although I probably would not come back when I'm pressed on time since the service is on the slower side."

I have however continued on my quest for the new gold standard...on my first visit I always order the same thing - Tom Kha Gai and Pad Kee Mao...if they're able to handle the basics then I'll put them on my rotation, which lately has been Thai Singha House, Thai Kuu (just for convenience to meet friends), and Pattaya Grill.  \n\nI actually decided that I would just go back to making my own (especially since my friend showered me with spices from her trip to Thailand), that was until I finally stopped into Vientiane Cafe.  I've been driving by it for years, unsure of what was behind the shadowy threshold.  I was on Penn's campus and just didn't want to be disappointed at Pattaya so I went out on a limb with Vientiane.  \n\nFirst, they have customer service...after eating at Lemon Grass for so many years, I was stunned by the attentiveness of the server...and when I said that the soup was a tad too sweet, he returned with a lime \"to balance the flavor\" and it did.  I attributed this ethic to the fact that they appeared to be second generation; hence, they understand the customer experience. \n\nSecond, the food was very good...after I added the lime, the \"coconut milk soup\" was spot on, and the \"drunken noodles\" were just the right spiciness, achieved with chili oil and dried chilies, and for the first time ever, a nice balance between chicken, veggies, and noodles.  \n\nI plan to return for another prix-fixe lunch and an early-bird dinner.

We had gone to Vietnam Cafe a few weeks back and it was amazing so I was REALLY excited to go here after reading the menu. I love asian food and one of my favorite soups is Tom Yum soup so I was really excited to try the Yum Salad (which is odd because soup is better than salad).\n\nAnyways they had a early bird dinner special where you could get a salad an app and an entree so I went with that.\n\nThe salad came out first and it speaks of a \"spicy lemon dressing\". Tom Yum soup is spicy so this was in line. The first bite I had tasted awful, I couldn't describe it but it brought back memories of something gross. All the other bites however didn't have that same taste (I was actually trying to figure out what the taste was with additional bites, but never got it again. Not a bad thing I guess). The dressing was in no way spicy, it was very sweet. Gave it a 2 out of 5.\n\nThe next thing was the chicken satay. Either they cooked it on top of fish or used tongs they used fish on, but it tasted like fish. I like chicken and I like fish, but I don't want my chicken tasting like fish. 1 out of 5\n\nNext I got the Ginger Sauce with shrimp. They have a spicy level, and 5 options. I like things very spicy, but with Thai food I know it can get quite extreme. I went with Very Spicy, which is 1 notch down from their spiciest. When it came there wasn't even a hint of heat from the spices. Personally I think they used the sweet basil sauce instead as it almost tasted like a very sweet tomato sauce. 1 out of 5.\n\nNo interest in going back here again. Vietnam Cafe is a much better choice. Won't hold it against the GF, she's recommended some of my favorite places in the city to eat, she's due a dud."

That might not be saying much, since I've only tried a handful of places, but from my two experiences dining here, there really isn't much I would've done differently. The first time, I got the Pad Kee Mao (due to a fellow Yelper's raving on how it took her a year to stop ordering it!) and I almost had to fight off my boyfriend's prying fork off my plate. The tofu was perfectly cooked, the noodles were fantastic in texture and taste, and the vegetables fresh and abundant. I had a few bites of the boyfriend's panaeng curry, which was also quite the delight-- perfectly creamy and peanut buttery, with an extra kick of something I've never been able to replicate in cooking at home since (and I've tried). The second time, I went with a friend at around 9:30, and for some strange reason the place was packed. Our 20-minute wait was worth it though, and my Eggplant sweet basil didn't disappoint. The rice was a little too greasy for my tastes, but the eggplant was delicious and satisfying. \n\nAs for the appetizers, I've tried the fresh Spring rolls and the deep-fried tofu. The Spring rolls themselves were just okay-- the filling couldn't been better.  However, the 2 dipping sauces more than made up for the rolls' ho-humness with their very different, yet complimentary, flavors. The fried tofu was deeeeelicious, but probably not something to which I'd subject my heart every time.  I still really want to try the veggie dumplings (if anyone has, shoot me a message!)\n\nThe place is BYOB, but with all that food I found water was plenty. The service is fast and friendly, and the interior is cute (bonus: magazines by the window sills while you're waiting...I caught up on some interior decorating fluff via Domino).\n\nCan't believe I've waited so long to go here. Lemon Grass is closer, but (no offense) only a tenth as good.  With the average dish under $10 and lots of vegetarian options, I'm sure this restaurant will be receiving more of my had-earned cash in the year to come!"

It was my first time trying Laotian food and it was an exquisite first impression that only makes me want to keep exploring more! \n\nThe location is very accessible via car or public transit.  Just don't confuse it with \"Vietnam Cafe\" around the corner. \n\nThe atmosphere was authentic and interesting with cultural artifacts like tapestry and musical instruments from Laos. The real plants and flowers were a nice touch. The servers were sincere and courteous, even when it got really busy. \n\nWe started with nam nam vegan salad which tasted like very savory crispy fried rice, paired well with the freshness of iceberg lettuce.\n\nFor dinner, we got the King Soup and the pan seared fish (tilapia)wrap. The king soup was a coconut red curry with vermicelli noodles , mint, cabbage, bean sprouts and tofu. It was very nourishing to eat on a cold day but a bit on the salty side, so was my least favorite. It also resembled curries I've tried before at Thai restaurants so it was not as pleasantly surprising as compared to the other Laotian dishes we tried. Still, a pretty solid curry. \n\nThe pan seared fish wrap was our favorite. The fish filet was flavored and cooked very well (albeit without skin)  and the there was an arrangement of finely cut fresh ginger and lemongrass, tomato, shiso herb, starfruit, cucumber, and vermicelli noodles, as options to wrap with the fish. The only challenge was the the iceberg lettuce was cut in triangular chunks,  so it wasn't big enough for wrapping all the other contents and things easily fell out or into the sauce. The highlight was definitely the spicy tamarind sauce, thick, sweet and tangy.\n\nThe mango sticky was somewhat disappointing to end our delicious meal because the mangoes were not in season,  so not very flavorful and the proportion of sticky rice to fruit was not enough. \n\nOverall, highly recommend trying the Laotian appetizers and entrees dishes on the menu."

They were a bit abrupt on the phone but hey it's new years eve and you have to expect a little frustration. The food was awesome! The beef jerkey was one of the best things I have ever eaten. You need to get it. I'm a Polish girl, we are meat conissuers and this was some of the best. The ambiance was pretty good. Cute, little place. The tables were kind of rickity but who really cares. This place really made our new years great and we will definetly be back soon."

I am excited to see all the Thai restaurants and this place was my first stop.  The restaurant is super cute and clean.  The service is excellent.  I'm disappointed to say the food is just not on-par with everything else.  It seems this place likes to cater to the white man...sorry...not sorry.  I like my ethnic foods to...well...taste ethnic and not watered down.  I ordered the Tom Yum Koong soup and the broth was just ok but what confused me was why there was broccoli, bell peppers and carrots in it.  I'm from southern CA and have been to plenty of Thai restaurants to know that this is just plain weird.  My spicy basil eggplant and tofu was also just ok...super oily.  My friend ordered the Papaya salad, which was the only thing we finished eating because it was SO delicious and the red curry with chicken.  Again, why there was broccoli, carrots, green beans and  bell peppers in here is beyond me.  The curry itself was just ok...a little bland imo but edible.  Just weird to have those ingredients in the curry.  I MIGHT give them another try again at a later time since they were so nice and the papaya salad was so good but I will be checking some other Thai spots first."

I had been longing to see my old West Philly neighborhood again. In the back of my mind I was also on the look out for some decent, non trendy, authentic Thai food but I never expected to find it here.\n\nLaotian food is damn good food, somewhat along the lines of Thai cuisine but subtler. My dining companion and I found parking on a side street and as we crossed Baltimore and headed towards Vientiane, I was giddy with memories and pleased to see this old street looking better than the last time I waited on the corner for the trolley to take me to art school in Center City.\n\nThis place is cash only and byob. \n\nFirst impressions-one was how utterly delicious the place smelled when we walked in. I wanted to go from table to table, asking the diners what they thought the best thing on the menu was. Second was the unfeigned courtesy. We got seated right away and were watered and menued up with no waiting. Everything looked so good. Wonderful to see that sticky rice could be had with entrees.\n\nWe started with fried spring rolls and Yum Salad with shrimp. Excellent! Smart, crisp flavors and fresh, well handled food. Someone in the kitchen absolutely cared about what they are sending out to diners. The crowd was mixed; Caucasian students, married, straight 20 somethings, elegant looking mixed race couples, beautiful Rasta boys, professors, seniors-all the casual, natural and unstudied diversity that made me ache for Phillly when I lived elsewhere. This is not a big place and it can be loud, bit it's an easy, happy, comfortable kind of raucousness that washes over you and pulls you in, making you feel like part of an all embracing, wonderful party.\n\nService was polite and pleasant. Entrees were more than ample. My companion had green curry with tofu that she raved about while I had the Lao pork sausages-three fat, juicy ones with a side of sticky rice, lick your fingers dipping sauce and a mound of vegetables which were forgettable but fresh. I didn't care because I wanted to reserve my appetite so I could do the sausages justice. Time slowed as it does when one is having a really exceptional meal. Between the audaciously fine food and the people watching, I was in heaven. We were not rushed or pushed to order more than we already had. \n\nWe finally finished with Thai iced tea and the tempura fried banana (cliched but delicious). As we wound up our repast, we were making future plans to come back for lunch, and for dinner again and then for lunch and...who knows, maybe I'd even head down the block to get something to go from Lucky's for old times sake...\n\nRemember-cash only and bring your appetite."

But as much as I want to give it 5 stars, it always manages to have that one crucial snag in service that keeps it from getting there. The first time was how long it took to get the check squared away (which was also partly our fault) in the end. But most recently it was how long it took us to get some water in front of us even though we had some pretty damn spicy entrees in front of us. I love it spicy, and didn't exactly help matters when I added a dose of Siracha to the mix, but good thing we had some iced coffee in front of us! watching the server walk by us with the water pitcher a couple of times got to be some serious torture, but to their credit they apologized for it when they realized it.\n\nBut a couple snags aside this really is an intimate and inexpensive BYOB in West Philly. and Laotian food is pretty delicious."

The section of Philadelphia is quite remarkable for its Victorian houses, no small number of which have been wonderfully restored. There is also the quite remarkable Byzantine green domed St. Francis de Sales. (See my site http://www.daytraveller.net/2013/04/24/university-city-philadelphia-hidden-in-plain-sight/)\nVientiane Caf\u00e9 has very convenient free parking just behind the restaurant. The interior is small but clean and comfortable. The staff is most congenial and second generation English speaking. Our server brought us the menu. Of course we had no idea what anything was. In such cases I always turn to the server. \"If you were having lunch, what would you have?\" He proposed a selection. We could not have done better. We began with Green Papaya Salad: Shredded green papaya with tomatoes, chili, lime juice and special sauce mixed together in a mortar and topped with crushed peanuts. The salad with sweet and acidic and spicy all at once: a wonderful exploration of all your tastes. I will say, however, that it was so enveloping that it did dull the soup (at least for the first few minutes) which followed.  The\"King soup\" offered an introduction into another new set of taste experiences. The base seemed something of a curries coconut milk. The other ingredients I believe were thinly sliced white radish with unknown small vegetables. Long noodles provided the main substance.  Now, as usual with Asian restaurants, the main course came out at the same time. We have long since given up trying to have them do one course at a time. The suggested entr\u00e9e was nothing that one would expect from an Asian restaurant:  Homemade Laotian Sausages: Stuffed with pork, spices, lemongrass and kaffir leaves; served with steamed vegetables, sticky rice with sweet chili and tomato chili sauce. These sausages, so unexpected in Asian food bore little resemblance to the gristle and hard chop sausages we know. The Lao version has something of a creamy and unctuous quality with a hint of sweetness. The bill for our lunch was a bit more than the price of a Vietnamese lunch, but still well worth it. With our quality first experience of Lao cuisine we are sure to return to broaden our knowledge of this new face of Asian dining."

You may or may not be lucky to find parking near by, luckily for us we found one right in front of the shop. \n\nThe restaurant is not that big but again we were lucky enough to get seated right away. In ten mins, the place started to get packed and later i understood why the server asked us if we had reservations. Anyway my bf and I ordered the tamarind chicken wings, chicken satay and Tom kha ( coconut soup) we also ordered papaya salad and chicken pad Thai to go. \n\nAs for the food- we got 5 pieces of chicken satay. I thought 5 pieces was a lot but it worked out well since the size of the meat was rather small. Moving on to the taste- the chicken was very salty. It would've been really good but that salt was just overly done. Moving on to the tamarind wings - again very salty and I didn't taste the tamarind sauce at all, more like soy sauce. The chicken wings were pretty disappointing as well because the wings were so tiny. I've never seen wings as small as they had. Coconut soup was ok. Thank god it wasn't so salty, although the soup was not very authentic in taste. The coconut in the soup was water down mixed with green and red peppers, and broccoli. I'm use to simple ingredients like onions and mushrooms only. \n\nOver all I gave this restaurant 3 stars due  to the saltiness and very small portions of the meal."

I usually like to go and do a sit down meal when trying new cuisines so I have a chance to ask questions before making a decision. \n\nIn any case, I threw caution to the wind (I know - really wild over here) and ordered away and it was definitely worth the risk!

My friend ordered the King's soup - vermicelli noodles with bean sprouts, shredded lettuce, carrots, mint, cilantro, scallions in a red curry coconut broth. Both were delicious and very flavorful! The dishes weren't overly spicy but they definitely had a kick (which I enjoyed). I enjoyed the different taste profiles, especially the coconut in the salad - sweet but not too sweet!\n\nThe servings were ample, and I'm glad we were able to share and taste each other's meals - able to understand the menu a bit better this way. I also appreciated that the menu has a lot vegetarian friendly options (which is a always a hit or miss with Asian restaurants) so I'm looking forward in trying other dishes in the future. \n\nPricing was also fair, and I think overall we made out like bandits - paying less than what I think the food probably deserves given how well everything was prepared!\n\nDefinitely will be back!"

The rest of the plate is covered with a limp salad of lettuce and carrots, plus the 2 sauces (which are good).

(In Thailand, you reverse the word order and call the dish som tam.)  Vientiane Cafe's version is awesome.  I could eat this every day of the week.  The Laotian main course of Pad Kee Mao or more popularly named \"Drunken Noodles\" was just as excellent.  So many different flavors melding together to produce a symphony of tastiness.  Capping off the meal was a coconut rice pudding.\n\nThis was the best Asian meal I have had this year anywhere.  Def two (or twenty) thumbs up!"

All the meat I've seen here has been overcooked. \n\nI ordered an eggplant veggie dish, which was poorly executed. The texture of the eggplant was not great -- it wasn't cooked well. The dish was edible but not very tasty. Disappointing."

I half-agree. The spice level can be adjusted from mild to spicy (1-5) we did medium (3) and that was really spicy. In addition to the spice level, the style can be modified as well, whether it's gonna be Thai style or Lao style etc. We chose the Lao style. After taste burns were real. Had to take breaks in between and typically I am really good with spicy food. Pleasant surprise!  \n- Homemade Lao Sausages (Sai-gawk): roasted chili garlic sauce is awesome! Idk what the other orange sauce was but it was the perfect amount of sweet. The lao sausage was perfectly seasoned. The lemongrass and the kaffir lime leaves really did their magic with the sausage and idk how they were cooked but all the grease & fat were minimal. On the side was sad and mundane pieces of broccoli and carrots just so that the dish could say it had a side of vegetables.\n- Sticky Rice: served in the cutest little roundware! Cooked and delivered perfectly. \n- Pad Keep Mao with Tofu: eh. It was aight. \n- Mango Sticky Rice: mango was perfect ripe. The creamy and warm rice with the mango slices. NOMZ.\n\nVIBE:\u00a0\n- Feels authentic \n- People kept coming in throughout our entire stay so it must be really popular \n- A lot of Buddha structures and decorations \n- We were able to order from different waitresses, whoever was available. \n- Wait time for food arrival: 6 min 4 sec (for appetizer) 18 min 32 sec (for entree) 12 min 31 sc (for dessert)\n- Wait time for check arrival: arrived very shortly after dessert without asking\n\n**TIPS**\n- BYOB \n- ca$$h only"

So of course it's another restaurant that my partner was very interested in, so we recently made it one of our pandemic dinner takeout selections. The menu is quite extensive and vegetarian-friendly, and we both liked our entrees so much that this is definitely being added to our list of West philly restaurants to return to.\n\nI decided to go with a Laotian dish that I was unfamiliar with, Lad Na with tofu, while my partner went with one of his Thai favorites, Pad Kee Mao (also with tofu). While the containers were the same and looked similarly filled, the La Na is a MUCH bigger portion, even the half portion I ate was quite generous. And so good! The rice noodles were kind of sticking together, but still tasted great, the tofu was perfect- fried just to the point of creating that perfect crisp edge without being TOO fried - the brocolli greens were a good complement, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. I was worried it might be too sweet but it wasn't at all. \n\nMy partner really liked his Pad Kee Mao too, and was able to finish the smaller portion in a single sitting. While the prices are a bit higher than we're used to, the quality and portions make them quite reasonable (even without considering the Baltimore Ave markup). Looking forward to trying something new next time!"

You can pho it up with some soup and spring rolls, or you can get some chicken tofu, or seafood over a bed of fried rice with plenty of veggies. Not bad by my book.\n\nThe veggie spring rolls I picked up weren't anything special. Vietnam Cafe definitely has better, and ones at Vientiane were pretty similar to the generic ones you can find in many stores over. But the mad pineapple fried rice with seafood that I picked up was fantastic! the shrimp, crab, squid, and scallops that it came with were cooked to perfection, and the pineapple provided just enough citrus to add on some extra flavor.\n\nDefinitely bring cash since it doesn't take credit. My friend made the mistake and it resulted in us waiting a little longer than most to resolve the check. bummer. and now that Summer's in the air they have outdoor seating!"

A punch in the teeth of flavour, this giant, steaming bowl of complex lemongrass broth with veggies and meat will make you want to never eat anything else. I didn't order it, my companion did, and I had the most serious case of ordering envy I've ever experienced. I stole quite a few bites/slurps.\n\nMy pad kee mao was pretty good, ordered at a level 5 spicy and it was hot, but not unbearable. Then again, I might have iron tastebuds. The portion was ample but it and the chicken satay were both overpriced, the satay egregiously-so. 4 tiny pieces of chicken for $7, maybe half a chicken breast worth of chicken. It was tasty, but not such a good value.\n\nService was good and I was happy with the meal overall."

The waitresses were very friendly & patient with our lengthy decision making! I\n\nEverything on the menu looked delicious.\nWe ordered a couple appetizers: Chicken Satay (chicken skewers with a side of peanut sauce), Veg Spring Rolls (super crisp & mixed with light flavor) and Shrimp Wontons (if you like shrimp, don't think twice!) The food was super yummy and were totally looking forward to the main entrees.\n\nWe ordered 2 entrees (Sweet Basil & Ginger Sauce). It comes with a side of rice. You can choose the type of protein in it as well. The entire entree filled the whole plate. It was a mixture of veggies, stir fry sauce and the chosen protein. Simply amazing!!! Could've gobbled the entire thing but wanted to save space for dessert!\nThe Noodle dishes were equally great with veggies & your desired protein.\n\nIf you do visit, you must order a plate of dessert. We had 4: \n1. Sticky Mango Rice (fresh cut mango + warm sweetened coconut milk drizzled over a mound of warm sticky rice--the best Thai dessert ever.)\n2. Coconut Pudding (4 cute mini bowls filled with warm coconut milk pudding. A little more simple but after a few spoons you'll tend to love it!)\n3. Banana Chocolate Rolls (melted chocolate and  sliced bananas wrapped in spring roll paper. A warm peach sauce accompanies it for dipping.)\n4. Banana Tempura (fried banana fritters)\n\n\nA Great Thai experience. Will most definitely be returning for the mango sticky rice (and of course everything else!!)\nLoved it! 5 stars for sure!"

Whenever I encounter a \"Lao\" restaurant in a foreign city, my first reaction is one of skepticism. Some of the critical reviews of Vientiane Cafe made me pause before deciding to give it a try. And I'm glad I did.\n\nMy family members and I ordered only Lao dishes, so I can't comment on the quality of their Thai offerings. The Lao staple dish is laab - delicately spiced ground meat served with sticky rice. My pork laab was excellent. I savored every bite. I therefore highly recommended it. My wife's aw lao - a kind of stew with veggies and meat or tofu - was also authentically spiced and delicious. Our daughter ordered King soup - a coconut milk-based noodle soup. It was exquisite. As a side dish, we had the papaya salad (Thai style), which also did not disappoint. Finally, for dessert, we had sticky rice with mango topped with coconut creme - it was to die for!\n\nContrary to some reviews, we found the service to be quick and friendly. The owner, a gracious elderly woman, spent time chatting with us and wanting to know how we found the food. Portions were ample and attractively displayed. I realize that restaurants occasionally slip on food quality and service due to the usual chef being absent, or a shortage of serving staff, which can account for some customers dissatisfaction. This certainly was not the case for us.\n\nI therefore wholeheartedly endorse the food and service at Vientiane Cafe. I wouldn't hesitate to return."

Fresh spring rolls ($3.95; vegetarian; cash only, last I checked) come with a side of sweet plum sauce and a pleasantly tart fish sauce. Try the pad kee mao ($10.95; with beef): While it could be spicier and the beef is almost dangerously dry, the sauteed rice noodles are moist, and the mix of onions, carrots, broccoli, chili peppers, bean sprouts, and basil give it flavor and color."
