If you have leftover pho, ask them to put the noddle in a separate container as they will get soggy before second helpings."

My honey loved his chicken Pho soup. He has a cold and it was just what he needed. He loaded in the jalapenos and made it really spicy. \n\nMe, on the other hand....I really wanted to love my seafood Pho soup, but I just didn't. The shrimp were bland, it had imitation crab meat which I loathe, and some other form of tasteless white mystery seafood. \n\nI don't know, either I am just not as adventurous as I'd like to be, or I just ordered the wrong thing.

I didn't get as much variety of herbs as I would have liked, but the bowl was nice & comforting, all in all.\n\nLemongrass beef slices: very tasty, great flavour, well-grilled, fragrant with scallions on top.

They have also changed their menu from the generic Pho Hoa menu (they have the logo with the woman with noodle hair) to what seems like their own, and one that is much more extensive and like a typical Vietnamese do it all restaurant. (Maybe they left the franchise and went off on their own?). In any case, their pho is consistently good, and, for a Vietnamese place, their service is consistently good as well.\n\nOne time I was eating there an older white man came in. When the manager came to take his order, he said he couldn't, that he needed help from his favorite waiter who always chose for him. This guy had gone out to the grocery store to pick up some ingredients. The manager said he would be back in a few. When he got back, sure enough, he picked out a dish for the guy (eggplant) and the guy was happy. It was a kinda surreal moment because it reminded me of being in Thailand or Vietnam, where it's not so uncommon for the older white man to have a boy do simple things for him..."

However since they changed the manager a while ago, I dont think its a good place to eat at no more. I had dinner with my family and my sis left an empty container on the table. It was EMPTY, it had no smell or disgusting leftovers inside. When we were about to get into the car (coincidentally we parked our car right in front of the rest.) sudennly the manager (even tough I dont think its appropriate to put a manager title to such an ignorant man like him) came out holding the container and asked us whether its our belongings (with a high tone and rude impression on his face). I said no thats just trash, and he said it out loud (again with the rudest face I've ever seen in my whole life) that I cannot leave my trash there. To cut the story short, I came back in to the rest and asked about it, and he argued with high tone. Right after I said to him that he needs to watch his attitude, he right away pointed his middle finger to me! Okay, my patience's gone. I didnt think I deserved any crap like this. Whats the big deal of leaving a container on the table??? Its just irrational and super crazy for a \"manager\" to make such a hassle about it! A true manager would've just shut up. He even still arguing and kept pointing his finger at me while we were walking out from the rest. He kept on yelling to leave the place and never come back no more.  Not enough for that, as we're getting into our car, he AGAIN pointed his middle finger and shook his ass!!! He then made a gesture like he was about to f**k me! At that time my bro was so mad and approached him, telling him to go back into the rest if he didnt want to get hurt. WTF! Hellll what kind of manager is that! Such an ignorant, uneducated, and snobbish person like him doesnt deserve to work in any fields especially being a manager!!! \n\nI will never ever come back to that place and ooohhhh its not gonna surprise me if the restaurant will crash one day with the attitude of \"THEIR GREAT MANAGER.\" People pay not only for food but also for its SERVICE!"

My girlfriend ordered shrimp and crab rolls that looked so good I helped myself to one. Packed with seafood and few pesky veggies (I hate the green stuff) and fried to a golden crisp, they were the perfect accompaniment to the slithery rice noodles. The hostess saw I was struggling to eat the noodles with chopsticks and hurried over with a fork, saving me the embarrassment of asking for one. (I do know how to use chopsticks, but just can't seem to master the art of eating slippery pho noodles with 'em.)  My favorite part of the meal was the mango bubble tea. At least, I ordered mango bubble tea. What I got was more like a smoothie, thick and creamy and obviously freshly made.

Should I get grilled pork? Maybe spring rolls? Or how about beef wrapped in grape leaves? No matter which one you decide on, they will all leave you with a smile on your face.\n\nThe bubble tea selection is ridiculous, and they have a flavor for everyone! I am currently obsessed with the Iced Thai Tea, which is almost like a dessert! It's sweet and refreshing, and cuts through the saltiness of the pho.\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes the meat in the pho is sometimes a little \"off\", in the chewy sense. But it's still good!"

The good thing about the place is at least the waiters try to get the food orders right. I've had Pho there a couple times, but today it just looked and tasted as if well, it wasn't to good today. The Pho soup was very dark brown and it just didn't taste as good as my regular visits. I also ordered the broken rice with pork chop special to share and usually the pork chops are really flavorful with lemongrass but it was dry and there was no flavor. \n\nOverall, If your ready for a quick bite and hate waiting, its a OK place to go. \nThey have TVs for you to watch and its a pretty casual place to eat. \nThe servers are good because at least, they do try and get the order right."

In general, the pho is mediocre or bad. But today it was pouring and I was parked in front of the restaurant, so what else is there to do but go in? Anyway, I was surprised. Compared to Pho 75 and Pho Xe Lua, I liked it. The broth was more complex (e.g. had more spices which are associated with the south, but that I also prefer). The ve don was intermediate (it was best at Pho 75 and worst at Pho Xe Lua).  I often think that the quality of the ve don is a good indicator of the pho in general. I prefer the crispy ve don with the texture of cartilage to the beefy/fatty kind. As the broth and ve don is very different between restaurants, while other ingredients are more similar, I take these to be very significant."

Not good at all.\n\nThe biggest problem with pho was the broth. It was too salty. I almost never think anything is too salty, and this broth was salty to me. The broth also lacked complexity. The saltiness was flat (compared to other places), as if they just added salt to the broth and thought that it was good enough.\n\nThe meat. The brisket, flank, fatty brisket was not nearly as good as other places (especially Nam Phuong). The meat broke apart to all over the place and it seemed messy.\n\nFinally, they got the order wrong on two accounts. I ordered regular and they brought large. And I ordered #44; they brought me #45. I wasn't going to argue over a bowl of soup that costs like $7 to remake the damn thing. But it would've been nice if they got the order right.\n\nI think they are lucky to get even 2 stars. Their portions are HUGE though. If you order a large bowl of pho, you're good to go, even if you're a hungry 18-year-old (I think).

Though I don't really need help to know that I don't want tendon or tripe, at least not yet. Being easily skeeved out I settled for steak and brisket. Got the regular size which was plenty big enough and filling.\n\nThe spring rolls with the peanut sauce were magical. \n\nSince it was baby's first pho I don't want to give it high marks, having nothing to compare it to. But three stars is, just like it says, A-OK!"

We also had the Vietnamese crepe -  they were really generous with the filling, although it was a little greasier than I like.  All in all it was a solid meal.\n\nThe real plus is that they are open later than any of the other nearby restaurants.  We arrived just before 10pm on Friday night (post movie) after we had tried Nam Phuong, which was already closed."

I went for the small version, which was served in a bowl similar in size to one I make cake batter in at home - huge! It was so satisfying on a cold night.

In three separate trips to 1111 S 11th street, the broth has been consistent into itself.  The broth has a heavy bone and marrow taste to it, that unctuous, mineral-rich flavour you get when you go heavy on bone in preparation of the stock.  Because of this, I'm invariably impressed.  This shop undoubtedly lands on my pho repertoire."

I don't always get the pho (#2) because their rice plates and other noodle dishes are just as good. \n\nTry #151 (it has rice noodles, pork slices, shrimp, and ground pork with pieces of chinese celery) that gives the soup a different flavor- more porky than beefy. It's my favorite there. \n\nThey're also good for a big crowd as it can accomodate a large group."

And given the choice between no Pho and mediocre Pho you should always go for mediocre pho.\n\nService at this one is inattentive and inaccurate.  And they are generous with their MSG.  I'm the kind of guy who LOVES MSG and this was still a little much.\n\nIn addition to Pho they have a vermicelli salad with grilled pork, lettuce, and mint.  You're going to want to get that.  It's going to blow your doors off.  If that was all I'd gotten tonight, this place would be getting three or four stars (silly me getting Pho at a Pho place).\n\nI also think they have a bar with daring drinks and shakes and that sort of thing, which Pho Ha may lack, and it has a more cozy pizza parlor type of feel, so if either of those are important to you, by all means go.  \n\nFinally, there are a lot more white people here than at Pho Ha.  We had a group of three young white men sitting next to us who were practicing their drumming with chopsticks.  These were grown-ass men.  So if that kind of thing is your scene, by all means go."

Of course, the ambiance is nicer on that side of 11th.\n\nIf you are just not having a pho day and you are fond of rolling, they have great-big platters for this and don't skimp on the greens, herbs, and pickles like a lot of places do. I've uploaded a pic for your mouth watering enjoyment. This is the deep fried whole tilapia platter ($12.95). It really could feed two, but I'm greedy. It was perfectly cooked-crispy skin and moist/tender flesh. They have regular nuoc cham and the more smelly fish-paste based sauce, though they prolly won't offer that to you if you don't speak Vietnamese."

We usually spend around $20 or under for the both of us. \n\nWhen craving a bowl of pho, Pho Hoa is usually the first place that pops in my head. I always order #44 or #45. Yep, I remember the number because I honestly go there a little too often. ;P Their service is typical like many Asian restaurants in Chinatown. They're not really attentive, but their delicious food makes up for it big time. Their smoothies are absolutely yummy. :) I recommend strawberry or avocado.  I also love their fried tofu appetizer and their grilled beef wrapped in grape leaves. I strongly recommend those for an appetizer. The only drawback is that you'll smell like onions and pho when you leave the restaurant, but it's totally worth it. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone pho sho. ;)"

Oh, it doesn't hurt that food is reasonably priced, and that they take credit cards, in case you're short on greenbacks.\n\nThis restaurant - and the various other nearby businesses - are popular, so parking can be problematic - after searching for 20 minutes, I dropped off my friends, and drove north of Washington Ave, and amazingly found parking minutes later.\n\nRandomly, the supremely awesome Chi N.

But our most recent visit has made us change our mind about ever going there again.  They've always been about a 3 star place in our mind but lately we've noticed the quality has slowly and continuously declined.  When we went there a few nights ago, we had the worst experience ever.  First of all, it took the waiter a long time to come get our order and once we ordered, it took FOREVER to get our food. This was not our first time here and this is not our first time eating Pho, it doesn't take 20 minutes...seriously.  Ok, so, putting that aside (and hoping that our food was really really fresh that night), they got our order wrong!  They left out the meatballs in my soup, that I had specifically paid extra to add on, and they also switched the size and the order that my fianc\u00e9 and I had ordered.  Our soup was also off...it had no beef flavor at all...it tasted more like water. And to top off the night, our hot tea tasted and smelled like bleach and soap.  Ugh!
