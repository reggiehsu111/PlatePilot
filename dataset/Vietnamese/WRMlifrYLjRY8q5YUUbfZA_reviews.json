Paid by card & left a 4$ tip on a 22$ takeout order. \n\nAs they gave me the food i asked if i could have hot sauce as well and was told by the young man that thats 1$ extra... i had no cash only card but i was surprised because i was just there yesterday cus my bf is sick and picked up an order with the hot sauce without having to pay anything for it. The older man yesterday was super friendly to me and said if i ever need sauce to just ask so i was baffled that now i had to pay for it. Additionally this is the same sauce that is sitting on the table. I didn't ask for extra sauce! I let the young man know that if he wanted to charge me a $1 to go ahead but i had gotten it for free before to which he replied the rules have changed. And when i said that was yesterday he mumbled and walked away and begrudgingly filled a container for me and as he handed it said next time its a 1$... \n\nWhy do i have to pay extra to get the same sauce sitting on the table which i got for free the other day. Secondly i tipped u $4 on takeout. Ive worked in the business. People rarely tip for pickup so you still have the nerve to be a dick... I walked away with the food pissed off that this really just happened. and he had the nerve to yell nothing is free as i was walking away. All this commotion occurred with customers in the store.  Great customer service! \n\nOh and when i get home only one bag of toppings was provided for two orders, with only 1 lime wedge to be shared by two people... \n\nSucks as this is the only pho place around and i finally grew to like their pho. Refuse to go back and give my money to that little twerp."

We ordered 4 dishes, a total of about $33($40 with a tip), and had a little trouble finishing everything and licking the plates. \"I could eat 2 green papaya salads myself\" was my thought.\nThe large chicken pho came piping hot with a bunch of mung bean sprouts, a bouquet of basil and 1/2 a lime on the side. Next time, I'd get even more sprouts. So good. \nThe Shrimp Summer Rolls and sweet peanut dressing were delicious.  The Broken Rice/Chargrilled Pork looked like it would be our least favorite but was incredibly tasty. My friend who'd live in Thailand near the Vietnam border thought the rice was cooked perfectly. \nService -now this was late afternoon- was congenial, quick and sensitive, with 3 different waitstaff tending to us-without hovering. Since the food is so tasty, the price is right, and it's a new business, it's understandable that at rush hour, things could get hectic. Our solution, until the minor popularity kinks get ironed out, is to just eat early or not during peak hours. Hey, popularity has a price!"

(Fake crab meat?) \nPho Broth could have been more complex and flavorful.\nHis soup was lukewarm, not supposed to be. \nThe awkward string curtain by the ladies bathroom clings to everyone and gets stuck in the doorway.\n\nOverall, I am so happy to have a decent enough pho place closer than Washington Ave. Doesn't hold a candle to pho 75, but more authentic than trendy Stock, and better than any pho in Chinatown."

The service was some of the worst I've ever experienced: we were seated after another couple walked in behind us, given dirty water glasses, and left unattended for the majority of our stay. We saw several tables around us stuck without food and/or receiving the wrong order multiple times. \n\nThe waitstaff was more than incompetent they were rude at different points of service. (The hostess turned several groups of people away for both eat-in and takeout orders, one waiter told a friend not to eat there right in front of us, another couple of waiters discussed a table's food right in front of them as if they were not there). I've never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant."

I'm really hoping they can pull together the service and the food in the next few months. \n\nI'll second a lot of the reviews already posted but seems our experience was not quite as bad as some. We went on a Saturday afternoon right about lunch time with a friend so it was busy but there was a table for three and we were seated promptly.  The hostess seemed quite unfriendly but our server was all smiles but she would disappear for long periods. We did receive water and menus right away.  Most other pho places the food comes out in 10 minutes, we waited about 20 minutes so not as long as others have commented on. Two of us ordered bun with spring roll and neither got the spring roll.  We managed to finally get the hostess' attention (no idea where our server went) and she did bring out spring rolls for us, seemed she started pitching in when things got really busy.  No one came around to ask how things were after the spring roll correction.  It's not that big of a place compared to most Vietnamese spots around town so I would expect better service. They clearly need more help and more seasoned wait staff.  \n\nWe did see a few people walk out when no one came to greet them after a while.  That's just not good business. We never got our check, couldn't find our server, or manage to flag anyone down. We had to go up to the register to pay after waiting about 20 minutes (which incidentally is how most pho restaurants operate).\n\nTo the owners of iPho, if you are reading this, the neighborhood would very much like you to succeed.  Here's a few suggestions that might help:  \n\n1) move the register to the front so that a staff person (or two) is always there to greet customers and make more space in the front for waiting customers and takeout orders.  You can move some tables closer to the kitchen once you move the register from the back. \n\n2) have customers pay at register when leaving like other pho restaurants\n\n3) bring take out orders to the front at the relocated register so people can get in and out fast. \n\n4) hire a few more seasoned servers and work with the kitchen to get the timing down. People expect pho to be a meal served quickly! \n\nOverall the food was decent and if they can pull it together I'll definitely be a weekly regular!"

Always If you go to south philly around Washington square, you'll find alot kite asians with way more better pho at a good price. When you first walk in you are greeted by a waiter and you are given water and menu. I ordered the goi cuon as my app. It was like your normal tasting goi cuon. For my pho, I ordered pho dac biet. The wait time was about 20 minutes because there was only one guy working in the back so I felt empathy for the guy and I didn't want to bother the waiter. When the pho came out, it looked good. The key thing for a pho is the broth. You can have waygu beef but if the broth is not good then be ready to file for bankruptcy lol. This place broth didn't have that sweet broth to it. Kinda tasted watery. The meat was actually very good but again, the broth has to be good. The prices for these bowls is not what you'll find at a normal pho place. Price for large is $11 and the bowl is not big. With more hipsters moving into fairmount ruining pho, expect overpriced, tasteless broth, good meat, and tiny bowls. Service here is actually better than other pho restaurants which is pretty rare in philly for pho. Overall rating: 3/5. Could've went to 2 but service and the meat saved it."

Unfortunately, when it finally came the food was very average - nothing close to what you would get in Chinatown or Italian Market, for example.

The most important thing. First, in a good papaya salad, the papaya should NEVER be shredded should be chopped. And shouldn't have so much watery underneath!! It's a salad not soup. The salad is badly chopped ;( don't mean to be rude here. And the color doesn't feel like exciting. I ate great papaya salad before and it has mango, red radish and shrimp and spice. It should be a colorful appetizer not watery something. \nI ordered a small delux pho and it doesn't even come with everything says in the menu:(( SAD...it's doesn't have beef meat balls which says on the menu. Also the taste. It's not bad but NOT GOOD either. It doesn't trigger appetite.

Aaaaaawwww!\nI think the team from iPho needs to go eat at Vietnam Palace & take a \"mint leave\" outta their book!!!!\nI genuinely hope iPho gets it together it would be fantastic for Fairmount!!!\nI would have given my first visit one star but giving an extra star for our good looking waiter!"

I had a major pho craving and was fine with hanging out. \n\nWe ordered the summer rolls and two large chicken Phos. \n\nThe summer rolls were great and tasted just like ones we had at Mekong River in South Philly. \n\nThe server brought out two small chicken Phos because the kitchen didn't have enough chicken left for large bowls. The server was extremely nice about the issue and offered us a bubble tea and pork chops. \n\nThe chicken pho was GREAT. I'd say it tastes better than a lot of the places we've tried on Washington. Very fresh and the broth had a lot of flavor. \n\nDon't leave without having the honeydew bubble tea. It. Was. Seriously. Amazing. So good. \n\nAnd finally, the porkchops. Very tasty!\n\nAll in all, ipho was great and I'd definitely come back. I think they need a few weeks to get off their feet. They just opened on Tuesday. \n\nGreat addition to the neighborhood."

It is a friendly and quaint neighborhood spot to meet friends or family for a filling lunch or dinner. I loved the 2 walls that had Vietnamese hats and the other wall had a painting mural of a bamboo forest. \n\nThe prices are so reasonable and the pho bowls range from Small-Large ($7-10).  I got the large but should have gotten a small or medium because it's SO MUCH food! ONE Large bowl is good enough for 2 people to share. This pho is way better than spots in DC because it flavorful and not just a bland chicken or beef broth that was poured into a bowl with noodles and meats. I ordered the #32. I will definitely try it again on my next visit to Philly."

We wanted to support your arrival in Fairmount.  But we were so disappointed by the reception on our first visit, we decided to leave before ordering.\nBasic customer service was seriously lacking. 101 for a restaurant host is to smile, greet the customer warmly and provide them with some helpful info (or better yet, a table!). Do not leave them flailing by the door, and then shove them on the window counter, when there is space for at least another 8 people at tables (because you haven't figured out how to separate two tables for 2).  The hostess was neither friendly, nor did she seem to have a clue.\nOnce seated at the window, we were told that it would be a 30 min wait to throw together a bun.  It was 9pm, so hardly dining rush hour.  And it's bun, so most of the ingredients are cold!  We cut our losses and went to the fun Japanese BBQ place on Callowhill instead.  \nOk, we get that it was opening week. Mistakes get made. It's busy.  But employ staff who have basic customer service skills and treat local customers with some courtesy, otherwise they won't come back. \nWe're going to give the delivery / takeout service a go this evening.  But if that fails, we won't be returning.  Customer service really matters in a big city like Philly. There are heaps of other great places to eat that have customer service down, so if you want to compete, let alone be a loved neighborhood eatery, fix this, and quick!\n\nUPDATE on takeout - Zero customer service on the phone either. We're going to Pho Cali in Chinatown instead - ten mins wait for takeout bun and noodle soup (they know how to run a takeout business).  We might try iPho again in a few weeks, if reviews suggest they've got their act together."

It turned out to be the right amount of food, but had I been hungrier, I certainly would have wanted to size up or add on an appetizer. \n\nThe pho was a 6/10. I've never before thought that any Asian soup needed more noodles, but I did find myself thinking that when I somehow had at least a third of the broth remaining but no more noodles or chicken. Although I found the chicken portion generous, it was very dry and I therefore wasn't crazy about it. The broth was fine but nothing special. The toppings, which were fresh and flavorful, were probably my favorite part of the dish.\n\nRegarding mechanics, I found online ordering easy and convenient. I was given a pickup time estimate that was about 20-30 mins after I placed the order, and then I received notice via the order tracker that it became ready for pickup about 5 mins earlier than the 20 min estimate (i.e., approximately 15 mins after I placed the order). The food was packaged up tightly, so it would've been hard to make a mess out of it, even with a bit of a distance to travel. This packaging also helped keep the broth warm, though I imagine it would've needed a tiny reheat had it been a cooler evening.\n\nGiven this neighborhood's relative proximity to a couple excellent Vietnamese places in Chinatown, I probably wouldn't choose iPho as a destination. That notwithstanding, it's nice to have an easy takeout option right down the street that's a step up from greasy Chinese or pizza."

Decor - clean, tasteful, Asian-inspired but contemporary. Food - I ordered the pork spring rolls and a bowl of pho with rare flank steak and brisket.  Spring rolls were crispy, not oily, and tasty. The pho had fresh ingredients (Thai basil, sprouts, lime, good quality, tender meat).  Alas, the broth was not very flavorful compared with some of the places down on Wash. Ave.  It's lacking that \"stewed for hours\", hearty beef flavor I've come to love at places like Pho Ha or Pho 75. That's a big one they'll need to work on.  Service - started out strong, then fell off a cliff.  I was seated quickly, ordered quickly, food arrived quickly, then....hey, where'd everybody go?  No one checked in to see how everything was, my water glass was empty, I had to wait for my check (after I waved down the hostess, who was very friendly), then I had to wait for them to pick up the check when I was ready to pay.  Someone who appeared to be a manager was futzing with the lighting and the thermostat (we'll get back to the temperature in a second), but no one seemed to be paying much attention to the dining room, and not for lack of staffing.  One more thing - there's a blast of cold air every time the door opens, and the dining room was freezing.  They need to put a heavy drape or something between the door and the dining room in the winter.  I'll be back to iPho to give them another try because I love a good, hot bowl of pho.

I'm not really sure what was inside the roll's rice paper but the shredded \"pork\" tasted like cardboard and I had to restrain myself from spitting it out. The broth of the bun bo hue had heat but lacked any flavor (not even a hint of lemongrass; womp, womp) and the noodles were way overcooked. The bun cha gio was semi-edible. Noodles, herbs, and fish sauce were all fine but the mini fried spring rolls were oil soaked pieces of garbage and I am positive you can find better spring rolls in the frozen section at Walgreens. \n\nThis place does not do Vietnamese food justice at all.

I called ahead and drove there for a carry-out order of a medium sized bowl of pho tai and an order of summer rolls. I waited an additional 15 mins for the order to be prepared, and when I got home, I had a completely wrong order. Some sort of soup with vegetables and tofu, and summer rolls with no peanut sauce at all. \n\nI know they deliver, so I called and asked if they would deliver the correct order to me. Their response was that their delivery person wasn't working currently, so I'd have to come pick it back up (after hanging up the phone I went online to Grubhub to verify this, and it looked to me like they were accepting delivery orders). I don't live close enough to walk, and it's pouring out. I explained that I have a soy allergy, so I could not even eat the food I was given. Finally, after them telling me they would not bring me the correct food, the man I spoke to told me that next time, I need to order in English, bc what I said was something completely different. I have been to iPho (and many other Vietnamese restaurants) multiple times, and I order that dish the same exact way every time and have never had an issue! I used to order from the using the menu numbers, but the numbers change so often I stopped doing that bc I've gone home with the wrong order multiple times before. Really rude. \n\nI was told I'd get a refund next time I came in, but he never took down my number or gave me anything official so I doubt that'll happen. At this point, not sure if I want to go back since I just spend $15 on food I am allergic to. Disappointing.\n\n***Update - I found pho toppings in my bowl of vegetable soup.

Their shrimp summer rolls are perfectly cooked shrimp wrapped in rice paper are a must. Their crispy vegetarian spring rolls are fire. Honestly anything I have ever had on this menu is good... my favorite in their char grilled beef over noodles !! 10 dollars for a bowl LOADED with flavor and not going to make you feel like a load afterwards ! The perfect portion so you are satisfied but not having to unbutton your jeans !!"

I order a small pho a guaog with grilled chicken. I asked for it to be spicy but they only had sriracha sauce. We received  our food swiftly. Kay gave me extra spice sauce in additional to the sriracha which made the pho 10 x better. There was a side plate with bean sprouts, jalape\u00f1o, and lime!

All I asked was a bottle of Sprite, and the beverage refrigerator was right next to my table.  Second, 10 mins after taking my order, the owner came out and said they have no white rice or fried rice.  This is like a bakery running out of flour or butter or Starbucks running out of coffee.  How can an Asian restaurant run out of rice?  Lastly, 30 mins after order, the owner came out and said they ran out of pork.  At that moment, I walked out the place.  This place has no professionalism, no consideration for customer's time and most importantly essential ingredients for the cuisine they serve.  I still upset that I sat there wasting my times.

It takes another 45 minutes this time and I'm fed up, I want to know their deal. I ask the guy behind the counter and he said they had to MAKE A NEW POT.

Overall, if I'm in the area, I would stop by again, but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way."

Didn't particularly when my heart because the pork chop is not really on the bone it was pretty dry and It was really try and chewy. it is my first time here so I'll probably give it a second try it is on the price side for Vietnamese food for me. I just wish to meet was not dry and chewy. I'll try again next time with some pho soup based. And edit my review"

Growing up on Viet food, I didn't like any of the Viet places in Chinatown and would go to Washington Ave at least once a week for a bowl of pho. iPho makes spring rolls exactly like my Aunties in VN and their pho is fantastic too. I like that they have S, M or L size bowls. Many pho places do S or L. I agree that iPho had a rocky start but many new restaurants take time to figure out their rhythm. iPho's service has improved greatly and is my new go to spot."

I had their Pork Banh MI, and while it was pretty different from all the other Pork BanhMis I've had at other places -- they might have used a different cut, cooked it different etc -- it was still pretty good. Our server was extra friendly, and we didn't wait long at all! Excellent and wide selection of choices on the menu. \n\nWhile I wouldn't call iPho a \"Must Visit\" place in Fairmount, I will say that it's a pretty good option if you're looking for Asian takeout at a decent price. I'm still raving about their Banh Mi, and will definitely come back just for that, and to try their pho. I thought the quality of the bun of my Banh Mi to be top notch, you could hear the crisp of the bread crust and feel how soft it was on the inside! The pork was well marinated, and overall very well put together. \n\nThe only real downside with my experience this time round was that they didn't have their durian smoothie, and their avocado smoothie was ridiculously grainy. It was lacking in proper flavor, they may have put too much ice, not enough honey or sugar etc. I wouldn't recommend this smoothie at all."

Super hungry and so upset, I took them back hoping they would make me what I actually wanted. They told me they would not make me what I wanted AND told me they will not repay me. So now I'm down $10 and no lunch  :( never coming back here & I suggest you do the same! Horrible business they're running."

If you're a legitimate business you should post accurate pricing at all times.\n\nAlso they've made several mistakes with our take-out orders and then don't offer to make the situation right when you call back to make them aware of the mistakes. The employees don't have enough authority/autonomy from the owner(s) in these situations.\n\nDo yourself a favor and head to the better Vietnamese spots in Chinatown or South Philly (or if you're into banh-mi's, Brown Street Coffee nearby has legit banh -mi's).\n\nThat being said, food is decent and it's the only Vietnamese spot around the neighborhood (aside from Brown Street coffee which only has banh-mi's)..."
