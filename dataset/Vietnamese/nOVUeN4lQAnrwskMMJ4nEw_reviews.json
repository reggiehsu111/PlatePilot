I'm usually a bit skeptical about new restaurants with all five star reviews because they are most likely written by the owners' family or friends. But this one definitely deserves a five star! I got the deluxe pho and the soup was super delicious. I know I am going back soon for sure!"

I'd give it 4/5 -- the noodles are thicker than what I'm used to eating at other Vietnamese restaurants so that was a personal bummer. I prefer the thin rice noodles over what they have so if you don't like thicker noodles, don't order it. Those noodles were also in the grilled pork spring roles so also a 4/5."

The portions were very generous. While both dishes were great, if I must pick, I'd get the pho over the broken rice."

It's a small bar stool area with 4 chairs facing the window to eat at. So I'm assuming many people do take out there. But if you decide to dine in- it's BYOB!! \nThe food was overall a great price and a great taste. Especially for this area of Philly. The menu is Steiger forward with no thrills- you get the basic Vietnamese favorites. It's a great spot for a quick bite or try something new!"
