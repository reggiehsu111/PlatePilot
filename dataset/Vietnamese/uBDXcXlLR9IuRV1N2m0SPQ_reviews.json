A had a few co-workers tag along so we ordered to-go.\n\nIt's nice they have two options for ordering, a self serve kiosk as well as though a cashier. We all opted for the kiosk. \n\nReally interesting the deluxe pho is the same price as all of the others. I found this as a bonus because I prefer multiple goodies over choosing only one protein.\n\nService was quick but we found ourselves waiting around for those who ordered bahn mi sandwiches. When we got back to the office everything was packaged great, no spills etc. I liked that they give you all the sprouts, noodles, basil etc in a separate bowl...however you'll find at the bottom of that bowl is a tiny plastic cup of hoisin. Not sure why they decide to hide it at the bottom, but some of my overeager coworkers poured their broth in before fishing it out!\n\nI was really happy with the pho I thought it was super flavorful and I will definitely be back soon!"

        "text": "I think the secret is now out about this place. The day I went, a Friday, it was packed with a big bunch of everyone, a lot of office workers, grabbing lunch.\n\nThis is a fast, spacious, bright, comfortable, spotlessly clean, well managed, counter-service local Vietnamese chain (also locations in Bryn Mawr and Springfield, Montgo. Co.). They take your order via touchscreen and serve reliable Vietnamese standards: pho, bun (vermicelli), banh mi, and broken rice plates. Service is friendly and speedy. Portions are on the large side. It's a little more expensive than the Viet dining options you would find on Washington Ave., but you're paying for convenience and speed. The pho is delicious, the vermicelli servings are generous and topped with crunchy fried shallots, and the banh mi are stuffed full of crunchy, brightly colored carrots and veggies. You can add on typical toppings like sriracha, hoisin, nuoc cham (fish sauce), and crushed peanuts. Everything looks even better in real life than on the touchscreen menus. Even if there's a bit of wait, it's still quick and definitely worth it.\n\nThis is a such a dependably tasty place to go for lunch, if you're anywhere near JFK Blvd. or Market, or on the west side of Center City, or even if you're visiting from out of town and walking up to the Parkway from the Rittenhouse area. For folks who live in CC or Fairmount, it's conveniently located across from Trader Joe's and easy to get to in just a few minutes by trolley from University City or West Philly. Thank God they opened a Center City location. I could pretty much stand to eat lunch here every day!\n\nIts location is convenient for daytime Vietnamese eats, but it would be awesome if a Vietnamese place like this were open during late-night hours around the 13th St. corridor, on the east side of Center City, or within walking distance of Center City bars. It would, I predict, make bank."

At last, I can have some quick Vietnamese food within walking distance and not need to take the subway ride to Chinatown... or an even longer subway ride to Washington Ave. \n\nThe ordering kiosks were easy-to-use and it was fun to customize my bun or pho. Ample room to ease your way from the kiosks to the self-service station where you could grab some nuoc mam and other condiments. The staff was friendly and helpful, and they put a lot of care into each order they received (a lot of communication behind the kitchen line).  \n\nThe menu as of now includes pho, bun, com tam, banh mi, and goi cuon. I'm excited to see their menu expand in the next months to come as business picks up.\n\nI recommend their bun and pho. I liked being able to carefully choose the meats and toppings I wanted through the ordering kiosk. The bun was big and it was delicious with their house-made nuoc mam pha. The pho had a tasty broth that didn't need any additional seasonings. Lots of good pieces of tripe, beef meatballs, tendon, and flank steak. I did not try their com tam, but my SO did have the pork chop com tam. It looked quite tasty with generous portions of bi (shredded pork skin) and cha (egg meat quiche). I also tried their banh mi but something was off. The bread tasted bland/unseasoned and it made the rest of the banh mi tasteless even though all of the components were there. Not a deal-breaker whatsoever - maybe my taste buds were wonky that day.   \n\nLooking forward to see the continuing growth of Pho Street in Center City!"

The staff was nice and the food was really good!\n\nBut the last time I came, I went with my boyfriend and I had a bad experience with one of the staff members. We went up to pay with cash and the guy didn't even want to take our order; he asked someone else to. He took one look at us and I could tell he was upset. When he called out our number, we didn't hear him the first time and he got really angry. When we got up there, he was pissed and one of his co-workers said, \"Why are you getting upset over just one ticket?\" \n\nI really don't want to assume. It could've been anything; maybe it was because we're an interracial couple, maybe it was because my bf is a little older than me, maybe it was because my bf is a dwarf, or maybe he was just having a bad day. Again, I don't want to assume so I'm going to go with a bad day. \n\nHe was mean but the food was still good! :)\n\nUPDATE:\n\nThe owner reached out to me and has informed me that this employee has been let go. Please don't be turned off by this review because most of the people are SO nice and the food is really good. You get a lot of bang for your buck as well."

Good quantity for the prices. Reasonable. They have WiFi if you ever need to work. Oh and the coffee is strong. What more could you ask for? \nCons: I honestly couldn't tell you a single one and I've been coming for about two months. \nTips: if you're new to Vietnamese food just ask an employee for a recommendation, they're always helpful in describing what is what and how everything taste. If it isn't busy play around with the kiosk like Another reviewer said the build your own option is the best because you get to pick and choose what actually goes in."

Pho street has a simple interior design, with orange and purple colors - sounds funky, right? But it actually looks cool In person. \n\nStepping in, we perused the menu on the wall to the left, and made a selection. We placed our order via a touchscreen a little further back, and we ordered the beef noodle soup with eye round steak and brisket to share. There were other options to customize the soup (I.e. more noodles) or building your own pho from scratch. We waited for our order number to be called, which took about 10 minutes. We collected our soup with the fixings (bean sprouts, jalape\u00f1o peppers, and basil) and grabbed our spoons and chopsticks.\n\nFor starters, the pho was large enough to properly feed 2, so if you plan on having a bowl, come hungry! The broth was very tasty and light. The noodles were the perfect texture and I appreciated that they were generous with the steak and brisket - both of which were nice and tender. \n\nThis place was great for a for quality pho in a timely manner. Truly a pho-nomenal experience (okay I admit that was pretty terrible)."

This place is like a chipotle for pho except instead of picking what you want through a case, you do so on a kiosk before waiting for your number to be called and receiving your bowl on a brightly covered tray. The atmosphere is a dorm cafeteria vibe. If you want real Mexican food, you don't go to chipotle. If you want real pho, maybe don't come here. Don't get me wrong it's still good but it definitely does not taste like the love put into some dishes in a real, hole in the wall delicious pho spot where grandma is in the back making the good stuff.

I enjoyed the flavours from these 2 locations, usually a bit more in price range compared to South Philly, but when you are running errands in the suburbs and craving Vietnamese food Pho Street is a great option. The 21st street location is also convenient if you cannot get yourself to South Philly. Unlike the suburban locations this 21st location follows Honeygrow and other modern eateries - using smart screens to order and pay for the food. I don't know how others feel about Pho Street's screen, but I personally felt it was a bit difficult to maneuver compared to my experiences at Honeygrow and other places. It also had difficulty processing my credit card so I had to manually punch in the numbers. \nThe food came out pretty fast, and the flavours were also good. I like the fact that you can customize the ingredients for your dish. \nAside from the screen, I was turned off by the dirty tables, and tray rack area where you are supposed to take your tray when you are finished (like IKEA). When I sat down to eat the rack was full, but it wasn't bad. By the time I was done it was overflowing... The table I sat had built in hot sauce where I had to rub really hard with a baby wipe to clean. The tray rack area was a mess, and since the rack was not cleared people just put the trays on a counter where the screens were (to order and pay). \nThere were only few tables occupied so they weren't that busy to wipe the tables and clear the rack. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, so I probably will go back again and see what happens."

It reminds me of one of those corporate office cafeterias with fake \"ethnic food\" because of the largeness and lack of \"asian\" decorations. I suppose it really caters to the business lunch crowd. I came after noon on a weekday and it was not super busy - maybe being newer. The appearances are deceiving. I was very surprised at how great the pho was! \n\nYou order at these little screens which take credit/debit in the back part of the place.  The food gets out very, very fast in 5-10 minutes. Then you get your order at a raised area further back in the place. The pho itself looks great and the first thing I noticed was how MASSIVE the bowl was. I ordered the Pho deluxe ($11) but looking around you can see that the bowl is normally that size. It can seriously feed two people. It was great value so much that I felt a little wasteful because I couldn't finish it.\n\nEach of the ingredients was plentiful and they do not skimp on the beef slices nor the tripe. I had those beef ingredients AND beef meatballs. It was really satisfying. The broth itself was great too. Very, very savory without being too salty and heavy - and even a slightly sweet note. The nice sliced onions were perfect too. The veggies on the side were pretty typical and again given in large portions. The noodles themselves were great too - though a little bit clumpy.\n\nOverall I would love to come back again and try the other menu items."

Pho Street is a cafeteria style self serve self clear Vietnamese fast-food restaurant featuring the classic Vietnamese favorite dishes of pho, broken rice and bun style dishes. They don't serve classic Vietnamese coffee just the ice coffee pre-mixed version.\n\nService - automated 4/5\nIt's a little confusing b:c the entire menu isn't posted anywhere and the payment process is a bit awkward. You order through a kiosk and then wait for your number to be called. I recommend staking our the tables closet to the serving area because those bowls of steaming soup are huge and the ramp taking you to the main dining room daunting when attempting to walk down the ramp with boiling hot pho.\n\nHuman Service :) 5/5 \nThe human part of the service is when they call your number and you pick up your order and they're very nice there. \n\nFood...\nPho with eye round & meatballs 4/5\nThe soup was flavorful and the eye round was good. The meatballs are quite tough and rubbery. I'd probably not order the meatballs again.\n\nPho with brisket, eye round & sirloin 4/5\nBestie ordered the above and she enjoyed everything except the brisket which was well overly brisket-y.\n\nIce Vietnamese coffee 3/5\nThe t only full the cup halfway and at $4: serving that's like a $1/1.5 oz which is steep especially since it's not made to order and reminded me of melted coffee ice cream good but not $4 good. We could have gone across the street to Trader Joe's and purchased a pint of coffee ice cream for the same price. \nIf we go back one order of soup I'd more than enough for two people so next time we will share it. \n\nSo if you avoid the brisket, meatballs and ice Vietnamese coffee and stick with the other options you'll have a 5/5 experience."

It was a modern fast food style Vietnamese restaurant, which was a first for me but I liked it. We also ordered Crispy Spring Rolls, Shrimp Summer Rolls, and a Vietnamese Hoagie (Banh Mi). They were good. I did think the Hoagie was light on the meat but liked the peppered pate. The soda machine and condiments were by front entrance.

The vermicelli was good! Crisp and fresh ingredients, pork was marinated and seasoned well, and portions were very generous. I am not Vietnamese and cannot attest to how authentic it was but I will say it is comparable to the vermicelli I usually order in Washington Ave where there are a lot more Vietnamese establishments. \n\nPrice was very reasonable. My friend got the shrimp summer rolls but she didn't like them much (as I don't like summer rolls in general, I did not even try them). The basil they use is quite overpowering.

I got the brisket and eye round pho with extra cilantro and grilled pork and shrimp summer rolls without noodles which i loved (for those who are trying to eat less carbs)\n\noverall service was fast and pho broth was good. but i definitely have some constructive points for the staff to take into consideration\n\n1) there needs to a better \"dine in\" option. this place is pretty huge and unless you're sitting and waiting right next to the cashier you're not going to hear your number being called. either having some type of big screen announcing the order number or one of those vibrating buzzers will be useful when this place is more crowded and more people are dining in.\n\n2) walking down their ramp with a huge bowl of hot pho is not my favorite thing to do. i felt like i was going to slip and fall and drop this big bowl of pho on the floor or worse on myself. i think patrons would appreciate it more if maybe someone on the staff could carry the pho out or provide smaller but deeper bowls so the quantity of the pho doesn't change\n\n3) the meats in the pho were perfect. brisket was tender and eyeround was a bit chewy but flavorful. the grilled pork however was not as juicy and very thin from what i'm used to. i think for the price, it should be juicier and not as thin since the price matches most viet town restaurants.\n\n4) summer rolls were a bit dry by the time i got them. the rice paper was almost completely dry which made the eating experience a bit weird. i would definitely recommend that they use very hot water to moisten the rice paper so that it doesn't dry up too fast.\n\nAll in all, I think this is a great concept, almost like a panera for pho, and with some minor improvements it can be a 5 star dine in experience."

I usually get the shrimp spring rolls which are super fresh and the chicken/pork vermicelli which usually lasts me a couple meals. The meat is always perfectly flavored and cooked. The pho is consistently good as well and my go-to on a cold evening - coming from the Bay Area, I've had better Pho, but the Pho here is definitely solid for Philadelphia! Tip: fill up with extra peanut sauce at the side counter for the spring rolls!"

The pho is good and I would willingly come here again, but it's not 5 stars good (though keep in mind that Little Saigon in Orange County carries the standard for me).\n\nCame here at lunch with some co-workers and the place was packed - we were lucky to get a table. You have to order at a somewhat confusing kiosk and if you need an itemized receipt you have to ask the person manning the pick-up counter - there is no table service.\n\nI ordered the pho with beef and meatballs. Flavor was decent, though I would probably pass on the meatballs next time. Happy that they had all the necessary accoutrements for a satisfying bowl of pho - bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, sriracha, and hoisin. Vietnamese iced coffee was good. I imagine I'll be coming here fairly regularly in the future."

Ordering at the kiosk was also very simple, but there seemed to be no way to find exact ingredient details for menu items, so it felt risky to order the deluxe pho (e.g. which meats are included?) It definitely felt comfortable to dine in given the emphasis on physical distancing and minimal contact. \n\nWe ended up ordering shrimp + pork summer rolls, deluxe pho (it seems like the extra meats included were beef tendon and tripe) and eye round steak + beef meatball pho. My friend and I both found that though the food came out pretty quickly, the stuffing in the summer roll and the beef meatball (strange taste that differed from what I am accustomed to) did not seem fresh. Additionally, the summer roll was dry and difficult to finish. \n\nThe $11 pho price was pretty reasonable given the large size of the bowl. $6 for the rolls seemed too overpriced. Other reviews seem to compliment the freshness of the food, so perhaps my experience was just unlucky or a result of dining in around noon/lunch time rush."

To be honest, I'm not sure takeout pho is a good idea. It comes in all these tubs and you need to mix everything yourself - it doesn't stay as hot, and it gets kind of messy in your home, and it's just not the same eating experience.

The pho here is reasonably priced at $11 for a huge bowl (including tax) and is pretty tasty. I have only been to other one Pho place in Philly, so not much comparison, but I was satisfied at both places so I think Pho Street is a good option if you are looking for some Vietnamese. \n\nThey also over spring rolls, rice bowls, and a few other food options if Pho isn't your thing! The ordering process in here is also easy - they have touch pads you can see when you walk in near the back. Just order, pay, and wait for your number to be called. I should note the machines are CC only, so if you want to pay with cash you have to order at the register, under the sign. When you are done, just put your tray on the racks near the trashcan. There is really limited/no interaction with the staff here so if that's your vibe this place is for you!! \n\nThe atmosphere is very casual -  pop music fills the restaurant and the music video of the song plays on one of the TVS.

First of all, they have it listed as a \"hoagie\" so don't get tripped up. Second of all, it's pretty big and packed full of your typical banh mi ingredients. Those pickled carrots were amazing and balanced out the richness of the butter and grilled pork beautifully. I got mine with extra carrots and extra butter but no cilantro or jalape\u00f1os cause I did the build your own option. We also got the grilled pork summer rolls, which were pretty good too. You get a taste of every ingredient and the roll doesn't fall apart on you. This place is definitely going to be my go to for a banh mi fix and I honestly can't wait to go back again for another one.\n\nCONS: This isn't really a con but the place might be too big, it looks very empty and spacious but that might be because it's new so it isn't really known yet.\n\nFianc\u00e9's corner: I got the build your own pho. You can add up to 6 meats for it's normal price and have options to customize the veggies that go in. We got the food for take out so that affects pho more than banh mi but the noodles were pretty good and the broth was great even after sitting for a bit. My recommendation would be to eat at the restaurant if you want pho so you can better add basil and bean sprouts as in take out it's just stuffed in. But overall, very good pho, especially for center city/rittenhouse area!"

The meatballs are quite tough and rubbery. I'd probably not order the meatballs again.\n\nPho with brisket, eye round & sirloin 4/5\nWork bestie ordered the above and she enjoyed everything except the brisket which was well overly brisket-y.\n\nIce Vietnamese coffee 3/5\nThe cup is only filled halfway and at $4/serving that's like a $1/1.5 oz which is steep especially since it's not made to order and reminded me of melted coffee ice cream good but not $4 good. We could have gone across the street to Trader Joe's and purchased a pint of coffee ice cream for the same price. \n\nIf we go again we will share one order of soup.

While $11 is a bit higher than what you might find on Washington Ave, (we are not on Washington Ave and) the portion was very generous and everything was fresh. \n\nThe pork and shrimp tasted fresh off the grill and were both nicely marinated. They had a nice char while still remaining tender/juicy on the inside. The quiche had plenty of pork in it, and the rice was freshly cooked (warm, aromatic, with a nice bounce to it).

I've ordered take-out from here several times and have been pleased with the quality so far.  Pho deluxe....delicious!  The broth was really good; this matters most and they didn't skimp out on the meat combinations at all.  Broken rice and Pork Chop w/quiche was really good as well.  A big piece of pork chop paired with a good sized portion of quiche on the side.  Fish sauce that was served was really nice as well.  Beef vermicelli and chicken pho were also solid dishes.\n\nFinal thoughts......you're going to pay a little more than usual for this food since its located outside of South Philly, Chinatown..etc... and that is absolutely fine by me.  In fact, it annoys me when people complain about the price for a bowl over here versus other locations....com'on guys....you're in the city!  Some suggestions for improvements as i really want this place to succeed....\n\n1 - Put some music on please....your guest will appreciate some background noise.\n2 - Faster food prep (saw folks annoyed as they waited 20 minutes for their food in an empty restaurant).\n3 - Decorate the place a little please....such a large place with nice walls....all empty.  Some eye-candy would be nice when folks walk in.\n4 - Better packaging......the employee struggled putting my food into those flimsy cheap plastic bags.  Maybe upgrade your bags....maybe even include a logo?"

        "text": "Best pho spot in the heart of center city!  I love one pho restaurant on Washington Ave where all of the Vietnamese restaurants are clustered. But Pho Street ranks with the best. Recipes are the from the owner's family. Pho was loaded with white chicken meat, and the broth was very aromatic. Very clean restaurant with two TVs for the weekend football addicts.  So glad we found this place, and we will be regulars."

Most important, I told them to serve well-cooked meat and steam bean sprouts, and yes! \n\nThe soup base itself is really delicious and I also ordered extra beef and extra tripes. Then I learned the word \"extra\" One order with 2 extra portion of meat fed me and my husband."

        "text": "Got Pho Street catered for a Vietnamese cultural dinner. The main performer and speaker at the event attested to its authentic quality and ended up taking a tray of hoagies because he enjoyed it so much. \n\nOrdering online and emailing Pho Street was relatively easy. I just asked for a variety within our budget and they were more than pleased to accommodate our request. \n\nWhen the food came, we were surprised by the size and quantity, which is a plus. We ordered beef, chicken, and tofu hoagies. All of these were fantastic and had a little bit of a spicy kick. The vermicelli was also fantastic. The star of the show were the crispy spring rolls. We ran out within 15 minutes. It's perfectly fried and crunchy."
