I went in for lunch earlier this week to try out the vegetarian hoagie... i had the veg special. It was delicious. The roll very crispy and fresh, the flavors very strong- jalepeno, cilantro, sauteed veggies, tofu, and some sort of yellow mayo that I always think is a dessert (mango pudding?) when I see it in the case.  Anyway the sandwich is delicious, and although prices are now $4 for a sandwich (up from $1.50) its still a steal for a quick lunch.  I also tried the rice and mung beans with coconut milk for dessert- delicious, an excellent way to add a little protein to a yummy dessert. Next time you're in the neighborhood I'd recommend stopping in to support this local business."

By \"we\" I am, of course, employing the use of the royal \"we.\" Maybe I was saving one for later. Those bahn mi had the perfect amount of hot peppers and herbaceousness tucked into that crusty roll. I get covered in crumbs by these things. I present that to you as a good thing, though, you may be ridiculed as a Messy-Marvin.\n\nI just want to add that it was pretty adorable to watch the older husband and wife team silently making my sandwiches together. Whatever, I'm being all mushy about things but it was sweet to me for some reason. So what? Monster have...feelings?"

I wanted to kill myself-- their chicken banh mi is my favorite and when I went to another place it just tasted like cat food.\"  It's wonderful that a place like this could inspire such devotion.\n\nThe sandwich itself, of course, has all those ingredient contrasts one could want-- crunchy hot roll, cool soft meat/tofu, crunchy-soothing vegetables and spicy peppers.  The yellow pepper in our sandwiches today was a bit of a curveball from my normal banh mi experience, but a welcome one.  And the owners do it all in about 120 square feet of space, a marvel of engineering I don't think even the hyper-engineered chains can touch.\n\nAlso, a 1/2$ symbol is probably needed to account for the shop's $3 hoagies.  I'm not sure if I've encountered cheaper prepared food that has fresh vegetables as a major ingredient."

They offer about 7 or 8 different options- two are vegetarian (one regular, one special).  I attempted to inquire about the difference between the two, but did not really get a good answer on this so went with the regular vegetarian (tofu) hoagie.  It took only a few minutes to make the sandwich and it cost me only $3.50!  I started eating the sandwich on the way home- the baguette is rather skinny, so it may not be enough food for some people, but it was a perfect sized lunch for me.  The sauce was a nice blend of tangy sweet- mixing well with the spice from the jalape\u00f1os.  The cilantro and shredded carrots were fresh, the bread was crispy and didn't get soggy at all from the sauce or tofu in the sandwich.  I wish there had been a bit more of everything in the actual sandwich, but then again, I ate the whole thing and I'm full.  I'm definitely curious to go back and try the special vegetarian hoagie next time.  Recommended for a very inexpensive lunch or snack."

They had a good moistness level. The vegetarian was surprisingly good for not having meat (I'm a former-vegan turned carnivore).

Like the peasants stormed the Bastille on that very day, 221 years prior, I set out to storm the shit out of Cafe Nhu Y.\n\nI made a brave trek across the city, stopping at PNC on 6th & Spring Garden for $10 from an ATM and then down to 8th & Christian for my second bahn mi ever. I ordered a #5 (vegetarian) and a #6 (chicken) for my significant other. Both were delicious! Great success!\n\nThe rolls were crusty on the outside and soft on the inside - [insert your simile of choice here]. The tofu was deliciously marinated and flavorful, but not too LOUD in my mouth. Perfectly present. Not too wet or slippery either - I love tofu, and sometimes tofu runs the risk of becoming slippery, and I do not like slippery things in my mouth. Sick. Is this review becoming vaguely sexual? My bad, you guys. My bad. \n\nAnyways, I heard the chicken was good, too. The veggies were perfectly crisp and balanced. Together, all of the elements of the sandwich joined forces to create an excellent lunch. Filling but not heavy - you know I love that in a meal.\n\nTwo 12\" sandwiches for $7 is a steal. The service was pleasant and efficient - just one woman hanging out in there, making sandwiches. It was absolutely worth my early afternoon adventure and I plan on returning for a cheap, easy, and tasty weekend lunch. 5 non-slippery stars."

Good for veg-heads and carnivores alike, there are many different options, some of which Americans may find a little intimidating.  My usual was the vegetarian hoagie because it was so damn yummy.  With seasoned tofu, fresh cilantro, some sort of buttery mayo and jalapeno peppers on a very fresh French baguette, it is so deliciously light and perfect.  If you really want to reduce the fat, get it without the buttery stuff.  It's still good.  I'm also a big fan of their tapioca-like plantain pudding dealie.

The daikon/carrot mix is more finely shredded than that at the other cafes, which I'm not sure if I like; the flavor is good, though, but it is sweeter than Ba Le's or Cafe Huong Lan's.  They use a seasoned butter spread on the Sarcone's rolls rather than plain mayo, so that gives the hoagie an extra flavor boost.  The sardines in tomato sauce banh mi is also pretty good, if you are: a)vegetarian or b)want a hoagie but not the usual banh mi.  The vegegie banh mi is probably the best option here; it is stuffed with plenty of jicama, tofu, potato, daikon, cilantro, peppers, and cucumber on a crusty, buttered roll.  Yes, it's slightly more expensive at $5 but it is a fantastic sandwich and a great veggie option that has all of the delicious flavors that a proper banh mi is known for.  The special and sardine are $3.50, and the other varieties are $4.00; it's also buy 10, get 1 free.  I would call in your order since it gets very busy and there is barely any standing room; the cafe is tiny with no air conditioning (there is a tiny table with 2 stools max).  Overall, a good pick for banh mi but I still like my banh mi ga from Cafe Huong Lan slightly more (and the seating a WHOLE lot more!).  Would def recommend the special and vegetarian here, though."

It's a no frills establishment that leaves you feeling as if you shortchanged the person who made your sandwich...actually sandwiches as I can't imagine leaving there without at least two in hand. These things are so good, and the price makes it even better.\n\nI also like how you're forced into either trying to not make eye contact with the lady shelling pistachios or the few people in line ahead of you, and debating on whether or not to try that can of whatever isn't an American soft drink in the cooler."

Their banh mi thit nguoi (traditional Vietnamese sandwich), banh mi chay (vegetarian Vietnamese sandwich), banh mi thit ga (chicken Vietnamese sandwich) are sooo much better than any other place in South Philly (e.g. Cafe Cuong, Viet Huong).  We're always disappointed when we go to one of those other places...\n\nDuring our last visit before Cafe Nhu Y closed, they gave us a flyer that they would be relocating to somewhere on 4th or 5th and Washington Ave.  I figured it would be easy to find so I tossed the flyer into the recycling bin.  Since my bf and I are renovating our house, we are on Washington Ave and Columbus Blvd every weekend, shopping for renovation materials.  For monthssss, my bf and I have been in search of the new Cafe Nhu Y on Washington Ave to no avail.  We drove by very slowly on front through 7th and Washington Ave but could not find the new cafe for the life of us!!  It was so frustrating UNTIL we finally spotted the Grand Opening sign early December 2014!!  \n\nThe cafe relocated and has been rebranded as \"Lee's Cafe and Bistro\" at 522 Washington Ave. \n\nWe cannnn'tttt wait to try the new place!!!  Hopefully, it still has the mom-and-pop shop feel with the mom-and-pop taste and prices!!"

It is located right across the PNC bank, so you won't miss it. Plenty of parking spots in the area.. since it's not that close to italian market- well a block does count. \n\nAfter I arrived, at first I chose the porn.. err I mean pork one. But then I changed it right away since I saw this vegetarian special hoagie for $4.25. The description on that paper makes my mouth drooling even though I'm not a vegetarians. I say.. stay away from pork once in awhile won't hurt. So I quickly make a change in the order.\n\nThe bread, the veggies, and everything else inside are blended together so perfectly in my mouth. It gets better with each bite. I wish it wouldn't end so quickly though.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try on their Sardine hoagie. It sounds very interesting.. and yummy :)"

Pulling my vegan friend into the mix, we headed down to the Italian Market to give this place a shot. I trust Dave H., I don't know him, but I trust him. So if he says this is a good place, well, this is the place. It was awesome.\n\nI ordered the chicken banh mi and my friend ordered two of the special vegetarian hoagies. He said they were awesome but I was absolutely blown away. Granted this was my first, but boy have I been missing out! The crunch of the baguette, the crunch of the veggies, the slightly pickled taste of the chicken, the abundance of cilantro and the occasional explosion of jalapeno - well I'm hooked.\n\nI've already found a few of my favorite places in Philadelphia reside in the Italian Market - I guess I just have to add Nhu Y to my list of places to stop on my weekly visit.

You can ask for extra filling for a small extra charge if you like your sandwiches to be heartier.  I like it just the way it is.  I actually like this a little more than I like the other famous tofu hoagie here in Philadelphia at Fu-Wah.  Although I do really like both.  The sandwiches are different than the ones over at Fu-Wah.  Where as Fu-Wah has big, chunky pieces of tofu, this place has thinner, chewier pieces of them with cucumbers, pickled carrots, cilantro, jalapeno.  SO good.  IWhile we live right across the street from Fu-Wah, we're in the neighborhood of this a lot as our dogs' vet is nearish to here as are their food shops and my work place in Olde City, and we always make sure to stop by.\n\nThe other day I also tried their new sandwich, the sardine in tomato sandwich.
