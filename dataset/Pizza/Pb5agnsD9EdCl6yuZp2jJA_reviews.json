Not a ton of seating options, but it worked perfectly for us to park our stroller right next to the outdoor tables. They also brought us a basket of bread just to help keep our kids occupied. We ordered the Caprese salad, buffalo margarita pizza, and the pesto pizza. They were so good and IMO better than some of the \"trendier\" options close by. I am rooting for this place to do well bc we will definitely be back!"

The pizza is just ok--didn't exactly taste like it came out of a wood fired oven and prices are comparable to much better spots like Nomad and Stella. I know the place is new so I understand that the restaurant is nervous. We even let go of the fact that they screwed up both our drink and pizza order. But honestly, the wait staff needs to relax. Too much hovering and asking how we liked everything. I felt like they were part of our dinner after a while. It's incredibly annoying to feel like every bite and every move is being watched. I wished they'd pay more attention to pizza quality and order accuracy instead of nervously hovering over patrons."

The first time we went was around the time they had officially opened - brought our bottle of wine and ate outside - it was great! The owner was super friendly, explained their intentions as a new establishment and recommended a few specialities form the menu, which we agreed to... have to shout out the Spicy Diavolo was sooooo good! What a unique blend of flavors with the sweet honey, spicy soppressata, spices like oregano and pepper flakes and then that sauce  For dessert, he recommended the tiramisu, his mom's recipe, and of course it was delicious, too! Since then we have taken out or ggotten delivery a few timesand everything has been consistently great. We have stuck to their brick oven pizza, so far, because they do it right. Tonight I asked for it to be well done and I did not regret that crispy crust! Definitely give them a try so we can hold onto this gem neighborhood for good!"

Great dough, Nutella, bananas and walnuts. After driving home (about 25 mins) my food was still piping hot. 6 huge ravioli topped with mozzarella, and 4 whole pieces of delicious chicken parmigiana. It also came a very fresh side Caesar salad.

Although the sopressata wasn't super spicy there was small kick to it. They were generous with the meat and the honey which is a super interesting combination. \n\nI downed the pie real quick, but I do wish they cooked the pizza a tiny bit more. I love the burnt bubbles of pizza and the slight crispness to crusts and this one didn't really have that. Although this is wood fired, it didn't really taste like wood fired pizza. \n\nThey told me they're releasing a new menu so I'll be on the look for it and maybe give them a repeat."

We came for the pizza, but they also have paninis, several pasta specials, dessert and espresso/cappuccino. The pies are personal size, but filling. The bottom of the pie is Neapolitan- thin with a wonderfully doughy, outer crust. The log-fired brick open produces pizza in 5 minutes with a nice char. My daughter really liked her margherita and she's picky about them. I had a the parma and burrata with basil, cherry tomatoes and Black olives. Delicious! Our server made us feel right at home. 2 pies, 2 cokes and a cappuccino came to $40. Great option if you want to escape the chaos of South Street."

I tried a margerita style pizza to see if the sauce and crust lived up to the homemade hype and found they did not disappoint. The crust in particular had the perfect balance of airiness and crunch from the brick oven bake. The sauce could have been more flavorful, but the fresh basil and burrata toppings picked up the slack to deliver a very tasty bite.

The quality of this bread was incredible - I would come back just to eat unlimited bread. We brought our own wine to go with our pizzas, so talking while they prepared our pizzas in the restaurant was very pleasant. Our waitress had helpful recommendations as well, if the long list of pizzas available leaves you in a paradox-of-choice situation. \n\nThe pizzas came out very quickly, and they were pretty good. The Marguerita: the person who ordered this had already eaten dinner, but still managed to eat half of their pizza. The Capricciosa: good, tastes just like what you get in Italy and with generous toppings. The Mimosa: excellent, it's a great mix of toppings, with a white sauce that doesn't overtake the taste of the cheese but just adds a creamy flavor. \n\nHands down, our new favorite pizza spot in the Queen Village area.

Come again for the 2nd time and it was even better.\n\nI have tried a lot of other pizzerias - Vetri, Nomad, Beddia, Pietro's, Santucci's... but O Sole Mio has the best Margherita pie: soft, thin but fluffy crust; amazing tomato sauce - most places the tomato sauce is too acidic. Every components of O Sole Mio's pizza tastes so fresh! Service is friendly. \n\nThis place deserves more recognition!"

They allowed us to bring our own cupcakes and the entire staff sang Happy Birthday to our son. Very, very glad to have them in the neighborhood!"

The eggplant Florentine looked great but it tasted like fish. Maybe they used old oil at some point, I'm not sure, but I couldn't get even halfway through it. Salad was fine."

They called me To make sure I found it and when the gal heard it was cold, offered to replaced my pizza. I had another hot pizza in about 20 minutes and it was well worth the wait. Very fresh toppings, excellent tasting crust with the right amount of texture, and it was baked very well. I will definitely be ordering from O Sole Mio again."

We walked in on a Tuesday evening to an empty restaurant we were greeted very promptly by the pizzaiolo and I assume owner. We were sat downstairs Italian music played in the background, offered up a simple menu of pizza and salads with a couple of specials. We ordered a buffalo Margherita pizza and the special tortellini in ros\u00e9 sauce. Pizza was excellently cooked with a crispy thin darkened crust, fresh basil, and a delicate red sauce. Tortellini itself was absolutely delicious and left me wanting more. I have definitely found my new pizza place and recommend all pizza lovers to give it a try."

        "text": "When they asked me what I wanted, I looked over the counter, and kinda made up an entree, with Penne, Rosa sauce, and a couple of shingles of eggplant.  They put that all together, and made it to go.\n\nWhile I might deserve some credit for the combination, the flavors were spectacular.  The eggplant was perfect, and could be eaten by itself.  The sauce was rich and creamy, and had the perfect blend of spices, herbs, and some meat.\n\nThey haven't named the entree after me yet, but now that you know the ingredients, you can put your own name on it.  Sal is a great guy, and works really hard to provide an excellent experience for all of his guests."

But when I walked into a pretty understated restaurant (with about 3 tables total), I wasn't really sure what to expect. \n\nWell, it turns out we made the right choice because our dinner at O Sole was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Our waitress was friendly and playful. And WOW. She almost immediately brought us this irresistibly soft, warm bread with a side of olive oil, herbs, and cheese. We could not get enough of this stuff. \n\nTo eat, we ordered three pizzas - the margarita, capriccioso, and the mimosa. (There are two categories to choose from: red pizzas and white ones!) Pizzas came out quickly and were delicious. They are probably the closest thing you can get to actual pizza from Italy - woodfired with thin crust that's soft in the middle and crispy on the outside. \n\nPro-tip, don't forget to check-in ;)"

I ordered again tonight and I got the smaller pizza. the crust was a bit thicker, the red onions were thicker and saut\u00e9ed! I have never seen that in my life. Was not good.  the pizza tasted different and we did not like.  Underwhelmed. Also ordered a prosciutto sandwich and they gave me a chicken cutlet with little meat and tons of broccoli rabe and cheese. I am not a fan but we tried and was greasy and way too much broccoli rabe. I contacted Slice immediately about wrong order and hopefully I will get reimbursed. I am on the fence about ordering again.\n\nFollowup.  I told them I do not want the sandwich anymore and the pizza place is sending someone out to deliver it anyway ! Now I will not reorder from them."

The seafood was plentiful and fresh, but the broth was way salty.\n\nThe pizza had interesting toppings/flavor combinations, but was VERY thin/floppy (even for Napoli style) and also only 14\" as the largest size, and at approx. $18 I'm not sure it was worth it. BF did say his wings were excellent. If portions were a bit larger perhaps I would order again, but there's a million other Italian joints to try.\n\nStaff was very friendly, though."

I made a reservation with google, it's so easy.\n\nI asked for indoor seating and got seated near the balcony with a nice view of the street. Our seating is also next to the kitchen who had Latino music being played. I felt like I was in a Mexican restaurant instead of at an Italian restaurant. \n\nThey served warm bread which used the same dough as the pizza. So delicious with the olive oil dipping.\n\nAppetizer: bruschetta. The bread was nicely toasted with generous chunks of tomatoes drizzled with balsamic vinegar. Highly recommended.\n\nI ordered salad with seafood. I was expecting a dinner size salad but it was served in a small bowl. It's quite expensive for $18.\n\nEggplant pizza: the crust is doughy in my opinion. Good stretch and chewiness but lack of some crispness of the crust.\n\nTiramisu is quite delicious, I enjoyed the lady fingers soaked with the espresso."

They both have heard good things about the restaurant but had not stopped in yet until tonight. They're sold and we'll be coming back next time we visit! It's BYOB.. (I have never seen that before so I was caught off thinking it was a funny but it really is bring your own beer!) We were sat downstairs in quaint little area, the lighting was a little dark but overall not bad. Our server was BRAND new I believe it was her first night and she did so amazing! She had not tried anything on the menu yet, we appreciated her honesty, but she knew all the ingredients and information about the food either everything we asked her. She was very tentative to our table and we got an extra order of their bread with oil/vinegar...it's hard to have one serving it's way too good. We ordered three pizzas; cheese, a sweet type (it had honey on it), then one with kalomata olives and pepperoni I believe. (I'm sorry I don't remember the names of the pizzas!) but the one with honey was the best and I highly recommend it. The chef then came out with a 4th pizza, he said that he had overcooked our cheese pizza so he remade us one. We didn't even say anything or expect them to do that, we were still eating it anyway. The service was so nice, it was very nice of them and everything was delicious. Please go check them out!! Plus when you check in on yelp there's a discount ;) enjoy!"

I was in the mood for flounder stuffed with crabmeat and sure enough on an A-frame outside of this restaurant was menu showing that flounder stuffed with crab meat was being served. From the street this restaurant looks like a pizza parlor and it is, however they have several small tables in the back were you good enjoy your pizza or another entree which which equates more to dinner. There were four of us and our waitress was the owner's daughter and her name was Anna and she was the best. The service was excellent the food was even better and we all enjoyed dinner that evening. I highly recommend this place and plan on going back to try some of those delicious looking pizzas."

Ceasar salads that came with the entrees were simple and tasty. Everybody loved their food. At the end of the evening the owner / chef came out to say hello and he was super friendly and easy going. A great experience all around!"
