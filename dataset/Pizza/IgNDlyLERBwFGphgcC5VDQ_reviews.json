A LONG time ago, they had freshly carved turkey and their roast turkey and brie was a delicious treat.  Then about 3 years ago they switched to the bland, processed, tasteless turkey.  After boycotting them for about 6 months, I came crawling back and continued ordering the roast (processed) turkey and brie.  \n  Next, they cut down on the quantity of turkey in the sandwich (to match the reduced quality, I guess).  Another brief boycott and again, I came crawling back. \n  All this time, you could always tell when they had a new manager.  More than any other restaurant I can think of,  the change of manager was always obvious - sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse.   About a year ago they had an outstanding manager- always out front of the counters, being sure all the customers were being helped, that the tables were clean, that the soda dispensers were working, etc.\n  Well, the management for the past 6 months or so has gone from good to atrocious!  At least one of the soda dispensers is usually out of order.  The orderly lines to order either salad or sandwich, marked by signs over the counter, have disappeared, to be replaced by nothing but a milling group of customers not knowing where to stand to order what.  \n   The final straw came on a Sunday about 2 weeks ago.  I went in about 12:30 PM.  There was nobody waiting, and only 2 or 3 tables of people eating.  I ordered the usual roast turkey and brie.  The guy acknowledged my order, then went to the cutting board and cut a flatbread into sandwich sizes.  OK, I thought, he's cutting my sandwich bread.  Well, then he took a second loaf and cut that.  Then he took a THIRD loaf and cut that.  When he started to cut the FOURTH loaf, I said, \"never mind\", and left.  He didn't even look up.\n  That was the final straw.  I have NEVER found the help in this store to be, well, helpfull, but that was the award-winner.\n  This time, my boycott is permanent!!"

The breads are made fresh in their hearth oven, might be a bit tough for some of u, but i totally dig that. What i also like is that u can pretty much mix and match what you want frm their salad bar to build ur own grub. \n\nWhat most ppl dont knw is that most Cosi's this one and others have a decently stacked bar, so if ur friend wants a cup of latte u can douse urself with that Vodka concoction, u knw where to be at."

        "text": "I have been going to this Cosi with terrible results since I was a teenager.  I know, you're thinking, why do you keep going back?  But it's because it is right in Center City and near work/school/home etc.  However, I am not going to be eating here again any time soon.  Maybe coffee.  MAYBE.\n\nAnd here's why:\n\n1.  I went into Cosi to order a salad.  I was the only person in there because it was an odd hour.  I told him I wanted a salad without lettuce (don't hate) and that I would pay extra if giving me more of the toppings was a problem.  He looked at me with disgust and told me this could not be done.  I told him I was pretty sure it could since he had everything I needed right there.  He put in the regular amount of toppings (tiny scoop) and then shoved the bowl at me and said \"THIS is what you want?!\" I told him I would be happy to discuss it with the manager if it was a problem and asked if he could put in another scoop of each thing.  He did what I asked while mumbling under his breath that this was ridiculous and he didn't know how they would ever figure out an appropriate price for this.  When I went to pay, the cashier had no problem figuring it out and I left but it was a not so good experience to be told by an employee that what I want is outrageous when it is far from.\n\n2.  I went to use their WiFi and order breakfast.  The WiFi wasn't working.  Something about being so close to Starbucks' WiFi and that it's \"sometimes an issue\".  They did reset it for me but it still didn't work and I was not able to do anything.  What's the point of having non working WiFi.\n\n3.  I ordered an egg and Cheese squagel for breakfast.  I was one of two people waiting for food and the other person picked their up and left right as I was placing my order.  It shouldn't take very long to make but somehow, 10 minutes later, I was still waiting.  When I got my sandwich, I rushed out because I was going to be late and when I opened my sandwich about 10 minutes after that, I discovered it was a BACON, egg, cheese and TOMATO squagel.  I do not eat bacon.  I do not eat tomatoes.  Even though I picked it all off (otherwise no breakfast and I had a meeting that wouldn't be providing nourishment), the bacon and tomato took half of the sandwich with it and I was left less than satisfied.  \n\nAgain, I might go back for the coffee because it's pretty hard to screw that up and when you need coffee, you need coffee, but these last three incidents (I have MANY more but they aren't recent enough to yelp about) have left me completely uninterested in eating at Cosi ever again."

And though I've been remiss in my check-ins lately, I eat here more than I'd like to admit because I can get a delicious, fast meal for relatively few calories.  \n\nThis particular Cosi has more seating and is generally nicer than the other close Cosi's (rittenhouse & the 4th/Chestnut one).  I can actually go there and work for an hour or two and feel comfortable.  At this Cosi you order your food at the counter and then sit comfortably while they bring it to you... and they even take it away later if you stay after you're done eating.  \n\nAnd the food is delicious.

Okay, I might get the same thing every time now (and I build my own sandwich, so don't be scared by what someone else called a \"limited\" menu) but I've tried a multitude of options and not been disappointed.  \n\nOh, also - get the COSI card.

        "text": "When I started living in center city and going to school in north Philly, I knew I would have to find a coffee shop where I could drink sweet ice-creamy coffee flavored drinks, people watch, waste time on the internet and maybe occasionally study. There were quite a few options for me to choose from and I ended up frequenting this particular Cosi for a number of reasons, despite competition from Starbucks across the street. \n\nFirst of all, there is free wifi, which, although sometimes difficult to connect to initially, is pretty fast and probably the number one thing that puts this place on a level far above its neighbor. The seating is comfortable and there is almost always enough room to have a decent-sized table near an outlet for your laptop, books, iPhone, dogs, trumpet, and whatever other possessions you are travelling with. I also love that they are open late (I think 10:30pm most days).\n\nThe coffee is good. Not going to change your life, not going to write home or even update your Facebook status about it, but definitely solid for a chain coffee shop. As for the food, I always order the same thing, the turkey bacon cheddar melt. It is absolutely delicious, possibly in my top ten favorite sandwiches, and I am a sandwichy kind of guy. Everything else I've tried here is decent, although I've never had a salad and they seem like a pretty popular item.\n\nThe people that work here are nice and very refreshingly unpretentious, which is another big benefit over some of Cosi's competitors. For the most part, the customers are cool as well, although this is Philadelphia and I guess a certain baseline level of unwholesome characters is unavoidable. Generally, the atmosphere is very, very chill and comfortable. \n\nThe biggest two negatives about this place are that sometimes the music is too loud and can sometimes be insanity-provoking, and that it is not well-lit enough for non-computer reading when it is dark outside. But these are minor things, at least for me. Previously, the biggest negative was that they began table service and jacked up the prices at 5pm. However the absurdity of this practice must have recently been brought to their attention, because they no longer have table service. Yes!\n\nThe final bonus of choosing Cosi is that they serve beer and wine, in case you give up on studying and decide to get slammered instead.\n\nGo to Cosi, drink the coffee, order the turkey bacon cheddar melt, ogle the gender of your choice and I will say with confidence that if you have reasonable expectations for a chain sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed."

All I can really comment on is the caprese sandwich and the coffee (I liked Cosi so much more when I ate meat!) and they're just....OK. But this Cosi is the best in town just for the ambiance.

Oh and as with all my other reviews of cosi's throughout the land get the chicken TBM melt!"

It's really confusing because you have to give your order at one end (not where the cash registers are) and then you have to walk around to the other side and repeat your order to whoever is at the cash register.. the setup is not systematic, it is jumbled and confusing and the employees don't really assist with directing traffic because they expect you to know the process (which i think is unreasonable considering no other cosi i've ever been to is set up in this manner)\n\nIn addition, I was 1 of 2 customers waiting on an order and i watched my hot beverage through to completion and it took FAR too long for me to be serviced. I'm usually relatively patient with this kind of stuff and I would have been in this situation had the employee making my drink 1. known what she was doing and 2. not had three different conversations with other employees in the meantime.\n\nDisappointed and probably won't be returning to this location."

It seems like they're trying to hard to be like Starbucks and failed.  I ordered a half a turkey bacon sandwich.  Bacon is in the name yet bacon isn't what I received.  Lady informed me they were out of bacon but they could give me pepperoni instead.  Well yea that's an even trade not really but F it I said yes.  My Sandwich looked pitiful. It was cold and nothing exciting. It looked as if someone gutted bootleg pizza crust and used it for bread. Next came the lemonade which I figured had to taste better than my turkey pepperoni sandwich.  I was wrong.  The lemonade tasted as if someone left the lid off in a smelly locker room.  This was even after I tried to doctor it with agave nectar and raw sugar. Like how do you make lemons and water taste that bad?  I checked my breath after sipping it.  I def wasted my money.  Get it together Cosi."

I have been going to Cosi since the late 90's when it was X and O and have hit most of the locatons in the City of Philadelphia and even the one in Wayne. I love the sandwhiches, soup, coffee... but my goodness the service at 12th and Walnut is UNBELIEVABLY BAD. They just can't get their act together. Every time I order something there it is wrong. The coffee and register staff (at lunch hour, I'll add) is always miserable, complaining or just standing around. \n\nI kid you not.\n\nSome advice: Don't go here. Try going to the one at 18th and JFK. There's a good Cosi. Or the one at 18th and Walnut, now that's a good Cosi. But if you get sacked with going here, take some advice\n\n1. Order food directly from the menu and make no changes. If you need to (which hey, I asked for no sauce on my sandwhich today) make sure you watch the staff make the sandwhich to ensure you get what you ordered. Today (like others) I did not and am now stuck eating what I precisely did not want. Saucy!\n\n2. Order coffee from the board, no changes. If you like a pump of this or a pump of that in addition (which they OFFER) again, make sure you watch the person make your coffee. You might have to return it 3 times (yep, 3) but you'll ensure it's right.\n\n3. Check your reciept to make sure you were charged properly and not extra for something that no longer exists in the menu. Yeah, that happens too."

I'm sure their intention is to IMPROVE, but obviously that ain't happening.\n\nThis location keep changing their in-store ordering setup. One day, you'll order here, go pay there, and come back here to pickup your food. Another day, you'll order and pay there, then go to the other side to pickup your order. Why you are trying to confuse us, Cosi?\n \nOh, you prefer to place your order online for pick up, make sure you got all your items, they have the tendency to miss either your bread or your coworker's bag of carrots, or perhaps they will forget the whole order. Re-think.\n\nI believe that their management operation is just awful and confused. I try not to go, but it is around the corner from me, and it is one fast Ritalin food. Sometimes I cannot resist. \n\nI have another legit question, Cosi: Why most, if not all, of your employees are miserable and unhappy. \n\nOne and half Yelps."

I ordered a salad with grilled salmon on top. It wasn't bad, but the lettuce and some of the veggies could have been a bit fresher - they had a little limpness going on. Another few stars off because the bathroom and drink/coffee supply station were pretty messy.  I can imagine this was due to the busyness of lunch time, but at the same time they were well staffed. I would go back again, I'll just make sure the food looks fresh before I start eating."

When I grabbed the salad, the man behind the counter gave me the biggest smile.\n\nMy only complaint is that the egg in my Cosi Club salad looked perfect, but something about it was off--almost sour. Otherwise, the salad was as good as any I've ever had from Cosi. Will definitely come back for lunch another day."

The other day, however, it was cold and rainy, and I was suddenly craving some soup. Not wanting to go far, I decided to come here (man I really wish Cosi had closed and been replaced by Chipotle, instead of Potbelly). \n\nI decided to get the pick 2 combo including a cup of the chicken, sausage, and rice soup, a Greek salad, and a side of bread. Panera offers a similar option (pick 2 combo), however, the food there is about 100 times better! I've had plenty of Greek salads since my fiance is obsessed with them, but this one was just awful. The dressing was all wrong, and none of the ingredients tasted fresh. The soup was decent, but very oily. And the bread was...well really nothing special about it honestly (although it was a pretty big piece).\n\nI'm very confused by the face that you can find Cosi all throughout Center City, but not one single Panera...one of the few downfalls of Philly!"

The presence of a brick oven earns you serious cred, in my book. Oh, and I absolutely adore your Turkey and Brie sandwich. \n\nNow that I've buttered you up, we need to talk... Just because you have a novel way of serving the general population sandwiches and squagel-bagels (haha, I said squagel) doesn't give you the right to serve mediocre pizza. I mean, seriously, YOU HAVE A BRICK OVEN. There is a certain expectation that the pizza will rock. Your BBQ pizza severely disappointed me. The sauce was okay, but don't be stingy, spoon that stuff on there! And the bread? I had flashbacks to my time in Chicago where deep dish lives. \n\nI expected better of you, Cosi. I thought you were the one."

The XO stood for Hugs and Kisses while the \"and\" stood for the first initials of the owners Andy, Nick and Dave. How cool is that! Of course, they were much smaller than COSI whose presence was well known in NYC. So, X and O was swallowed into the COSI brand and we are now obsessed with salty, buttery bread! Amazing that you will actually spend $2.19 for a slice of COSI bread! God we are pieces of...bread! Oh, the review... I like COSI but I really miss XandO and I wish COSI was more like XandO! This location is also known as \"GAY COSI\". I remember hanging out with XandO friends here after work at one of the museums on the parkway. I was a farmer dufus with baggy jeans and boots topped off with a flannel jacket. I looked so south jeresey, it was crazy! Ah, memories. So, go to COSI and create some new ones.
