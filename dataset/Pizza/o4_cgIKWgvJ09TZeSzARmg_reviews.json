Got home & pulled everything out & thought they forgot the wing sauce until I dipped my FF in thinking it was the cheese sauce. Who has yellow wing sauce???? Not good!!!! Needless to say they did forget my cheese for my FF. I called & told them. They asked if I wanted to come pick it up or put a credit...NO, I want it on my FF that I ordered. So I'm sitting here waiting for it to be delivered as my FF's get cold. Don't think I will be ordering here anytime soon.  I dislike ordering & having my order messed up & being asked if I want to go back in my car, & drive for something that was their mistake. I already drove there once!"

It is nothing special but it is a nice little place to go right in the neighborhood.  Everything is pretty good but my favorite thing on the menu is the Cheeseburger Hoagie.  I actually got it by mistake once and I have been getting ever since.  The gyros here are good and so are fries.  The wait staff is pretty nice and they always remember us when we come back."

The burger was seasoned well and the fries nice and crispy. The portion was also very large,\n\nThe lunch specials are very reasonable in price and I will definitely return."

The service is sporadic and shitty. The music is questionable. The regulars give me the stink-eye all the time because I'm not regular enough. I. Don't. Care. \n\nThis is the best pizza I have ever put in my mouth. I cried when I moved away, because Quality is something that just can't be replicated."

I will NEVER order from that place again and the store looked very unsanitary, the owner/workers looked like they haven't took a shower in days I would not recommend eating there at all. First time and last time. The food was disgusting YUCK!!"

Llevo varias ocasiones ordenando pizza, cheeseburguer, cheesesteak, chicken cheesesteak,  y esta noche ordene una peque\u00f1a pizza hawaiana y lo \u00fanico que he lamentado es haberla ordenado peque\u00f1a. .lol.. su sabor, textura y presentacion wow excelente, adicional a esto lamento no haber ordenado un extra chicken cheesesteak para mi. El personal de la toma de orden y el servicio de delivery son muy atentos y responsables en cumplir con las expectativas del cliente. Los precios son justos. Realmente si son lo mejor de Philly!\nGracias por sus servicios."

To bad there are plenty of other locally owned businesses we could be supporting. Besides the pizza has been hit or miss lately. Smh"

As a kid I loved coming to Quality but now as an adult I realize the the service and quality is terrible. They should seriously change their name."
