The new manager is also frumpy and has awful music taste; think awful 50s - 80s rock/reggae music that's disappeared for a reason, but blared close to full volume. Softer, more neutral music would be greatly appreciated. Terrible consistency with orders too, they don't have consistent standards with coffee etc.\n\nCustomers are mostly Penn students, business types who interact with the school (recruiters from NYC etc) and visitors to the area. It's almost as if the staff feel some kind of insecurity or have pride issues serving almost always polite patrons. \n\nGelato is pretty good and coffee is pretty good but can be sloppily made (I.e mix your own iced latte). Also slimmed down portion sizes and got rid of the bar. The place has a great location and nice open feel to it, but so much potential is lost because of really shitty staff with terrible attitudes. So many frequent customers but the staff make no effort to get to know them (and trust me, they try). I can't emphasise enough how much the staff and manager need to change."

You've gotta be kidding me.... \n\nAs someone who has studied abroad in Italy, I was skeptical when my long-lost college friend and her fiance brought me to Capogiro.  But boy am I glad they took me here....I was dead wrong to question this place!\n\nI'm usually a strawberry and chocolate kind of girl, so perusing the selection of flavors I was disappointed not to see a single berry flavor.  But then I caught a sign that said \"Avocado (trust us...)\", and being the avocado lover that I am, asked for a sample.  IT WAS AMAZEBALLS.  Seriously.  I ordered a small cone with Avocado & Nutella (you can never go wrong with nutella anything), and I can hands down say that this was the best gelato I've ever had. Creamy, smooth, and packed with refreshing flavor :)\n\nOnly complaint is that a small cone costs $5....for a poor med student, it's a steep price for some sweet indulgence!"

Very sweet and tangy without tasting artificial at all."

        "text": "Oh man, it's a good thing Capogiro didn't open until before my senior year, otherwise I would have blown so much more money on their tasty (but pricey) gelato.\n\nFirst things first: the gelato is truly incredible. They have a huge selection of rotating flavors, and the flavors tend to match with what's seasonal, so you will have stuff like Pumpkin and Chestnut in the winter and fruity stuff and berries in the summer. However, they do have a fairly stable core of flavors like Nocciola Piemontese (Hazelnut), Fior Di Latte (Milk), and Cioccolato Scuro (Dark Chocolate) that are available most days. They will let you sample as many flavors as you would like before you place your order, so take advantage of that if you don't know what you want (or, if you already know what you want, if you just want some free samples). Since I love pretty much anything that has peanut butter in it, one of my favorite flavors was the Peanut Butter gelato, which was peanut gelato with a swirl of peanut butter mixed in - SO GOOD. Others that I really liked include Bacio (chocolate and hazelnut gelato with caramelized hazelnuts; it tastes like Nutella with crunchy hazelnuts tossed in for good measure), Chocolate Scuro (seriously dark and rich, this is the gelato of any chocolate lover's dreams), and Turkish Coffee (a really perky coffee flavor with a hint of cardamom giving it a nice kick), but really, I don't think I ran into a flavor that I didn't like. They also have some rather interesting flavors using alcohol and rums - Cucumber with Grey Goose, Dark and Stormy, etc. \n\nOkay, so I really love the gelato here, but honestly, the prices are pretty steep. It costs close to $6 for a medium cup, and even though the medium lets you get your choice of up to 3 different flavors, that's still a really expensive cup of gelato. Oh well, I guess you get what you pay for, as the quality ingredients used in the top-notch gelato here make it worthwhile to come here for an occasional splurge."

The dark chocolate was pretty good, but I'm not much of a fan of cold and chocolate together in the first place so I don't think I can make a fair judgment there.

If you've never had gelato and you like to savor your ice cream using small bites, this place is for you.\n\nThis gelato is delicious - very smooth and either rich or light depending on the flavor. I had the dark chocolate which was like eating chocolate cake batter. It was a little overwhelmingly sweet for my taste, but still very good. I have the coconut milk one as well which was creamy and was definitely the defining characteristic of gelato: smooth and refreshingly rich. The last and most surprising flavor was the grapefruit. It was my absolute favorite and I am very happy that I picked it. It was tangy, yet creamy and very smooth. I found it to be incredibly refreshing and light and definitely a worthy flavor. \n\nThe flavors were reminiscent of European ice cream shop soft-serve flavors, which was very nostalgic. \n\nWhat I did not like: the price. It was just way too much. Sure they use quality ingredients and it is locally made, and it's trendy and a nice spot- but really? $7 for a medium (which is equivalent to about half a cup.) Not a place that I would go every day, that's for sure. Definitely much better quality than the over-priced LA-NYC chain Pinkberry (I'm only comparing the two because of price otherwise they really have nothing in common.)\n\nWhat it is good for: If it's a hot night and you're with-in a five block radius and have a group of friends - everyone is destined to find something they like there."

First of all, let's get the basics out of the way: the gelato is really good, the service is swift, and the place is clean, bright, and delightful. The gelato isn't quite as good as at Pitango Gelato (our favorite in the DC area) but it's extremely good all the same. Their banana chocolate flavor is particularly excellent! So, based on the gelato, Capogiro gets 4 stars.\n\nBut it's rated higher in my estimation because, first, it has lots of seating, inside and out, and free wifi. Ice cream, coffee, and free wifi? If I could marry it, I'd be on my knee in half a second. The more romantic reason for rating it higher, though, is that the place is built on the site of an old Baskin Robbins at which yours truly worked for a summer when I was courting my beloved (my future wife, not Gold Medal Ribbon ice cream...though that rated very high in my affections at the time, too, because I essentially lived on the stuff, being a poorly-paid itinerant). It's extremely pleasing to see a fancy ice cream store here now. It's like it and I have matured whimsically together.\n\nHighly recommended, but do visit Pitango if you're ever in DC."

The bar service is slow.

The gelato is fantastic and the flavors are constantly rotated.  If you go this week, and then again next week, you will not see the same selection.  I have never had a \"bad\" gelato here.  The texture is correct, the flavors are creative and interesting, and it's not too rich.  Grab an affogato (drowned) which is gelato with a shot of espresso poured over it and revel in the decadence.  Frappes are great. \n If you are depressed or lonely or unhappy, this place will remind you that, indeed, there is good in this world.  \n\nI never tried any sandwiches or lunches here because I think the gelato is enough to calorically sustain me until dinner."

The sesame seed had a nice nuttiness, but wasn't nearly sweet enough to classify it as a great sesame seed dessert. \n\nThe space itself has a nice ambiance and plenty of seating including an outdoor patio that is probably great for people watching.

Luckily, the worker was kind enough to humor me and allow me to try a few samples, and to ask a lot of silly questions, before deciding.\n\nWe were told that all of the gelato was made from milk from an Amish farm in Lancaster County, and that the sweet Amish milk flavor is the base they use for all of the other gelato flavors. Because there was so much to pick from, we ended up asking which flavors we should get. He suggested gooseberry if we wanted to get something local that we can't get elsewhere, or strawberry since they're in season and from Lancaster County... I ended up with miniature cup of toasted almond and strawberry terragon, and they were delicious. Before filling up my cup, he asked if I liked terragon and gave me a sample to make sure that I'd be happy with my choice.\n\nI also requested to top my gelato with free panna per the sign on the counter, not exactly knowing what it was... it's whipped cream. A friend said that the panna here was amazing, but I didn't care for it and could have done well enough with just the gelato, instead.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my gelato and I appreciated the good customer service!

I have been to the Capogiro on East Passyunk and they have their gelato delivered from the main stores...it is really such a travesty because it completely messes with the consistency. And consistency is KEY when it comes to gelato. \nThis place though? Never had any issues. The gelato is creamy and delicious every. darn. time. \nYes it's pricey, we know.\nBut if you're a fan of gelato, you're going to be paying about the same amount as you would for Ben & Jerry's, so you might as well go to the gelato place instead.  Plus, even when you get a small they really pile it into the cup. I must say my favorite combo is the Mocha and Dark Chocolate. Amazing.\nPlus, the staff is so friendly and I appreciate that a lot. There is ample seating for studying, or meeting with friends, or just sitting by yourself and enjoying some gelato after a hard day...because I do that a lot. and the best part is, no one has ever judged me for it!\nthis place is the best!"

I politely ask for spoons for my friends and the cashier slammed, yes slammed, his hand into the bucket of spoons and handled one to me. I did ask for some spoons since only one of my friends was with me and I had more friends waiting for me outside that I wanted to try their gelato flavors. He handled me one by one angrily.\n\nFor the level of service and price he gave me, I could've just went to the McDonald's down the block and received more ice cream and the same level of service. \n\nOverall, I'll stick to my McDonald's!

Then, the friendly man behind the counter informed me that they also had an espresso and alcohol bar! If that doesn't satisfy every craving... \n\nThe first time I went I had the dark chocolate and lemon. Dark chocolate gelato just like what I tasted in Rapalo, Italy, and the lemon was so refreshing-- not too sweet either. The second time I had nutella and grapefruit. Both were delicious, but I don't recommend this flavor combo. I just couldn't resist trying both flavors!\n\nLast time, I went to Capogiro for a drink. The beers were a little pricey, so I thought I'd spend the extra $1.50 and get a raspberry daiquiri, made with raspberry gelato, white rum, and lemon juice. It was so pretty that I took a picture! Our server also mentioned that the milk used for the gelato comes from Lancaster County and the flavors are seasonal and the fruit is locally sourced. I will definitely be back to Capogiro soon."

Overall it was quite good, but the mint/chocolate wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped. \n\nThere is plenty of seating inside and outside of this store, which takes advantage of high ceilings and pane glass walls to create an open space. \n\nThe ambience is relaxed, and the music is a bit loud to study/read to, but it is a nice place to sit and relax (and enjoy your coffee and/or gelato treat).\n\nI will be back to try other gelato flavors- in the spring."

I arrived 20 minutes before my friends and the employees had no problem with me sitting in the AC before I purchased anything.  The wait staff were also very pleasant while I sampled a number of flavors before making my decision: White Peach (not be confused with the regular Peach flavor) that had refreshing little chunks of peaches. \n\nI also sampled the Avocado (surprisingly nice flavor but *way* too rich and creamy, even for gelato), Thai Coconut (delicious, but a very strong - you have to love coconut!), and Banana Rum (my least favorite as it did not taste like a natural banana flavor).\n\nThough pricey ($4+ for a small cup), it is delicious.

I went with the coffee and dark chocolate. The dark chocolate gelato was super decadent and the consistency was almost that of a fudge. I swear after two bites I was hooked.

Not to say their other fine flavors are less worthy, but I'm a loyalist. Trust me, you can't go wrong with any of their many decadent gelato and fresh sorbet flavors. I know they also serve coffees, sandwiches, and baked sweets, but I hardly notice them because I'm often too preoccupied scarfing down the dark chocolate and hazelnut gelato."

Probably due to its high volume of college students and business workers. Not to mention, they have much more seating than the other location I've been to. \n\nI got the Pistachio and Hazelnut gelatos together. It's very smooth and definitely packs a punch in flavor profiles. You could say the taste of their gelato was nutty. *cue rim shot for bad puns*\n\nWould definitely come back to try some of their other options of treats. I'm thinking affogato next time!

Each time I ask to try the gelato (because, you know, I'd like to try the different flavors before I spend more than $5 on two flavors), the cashier kind of just glares at me or stares at me, making me feel extremely uncomfortable. So by the time I get the gelato, I just kind of want to pay the money and go to the table furthest away from the cashier. I'm usually pretty okay with bad service, but at a place like Capogiro, which focuses on fancier desserts, I would expect better attitudes from the workers there.\n\nAnyway, moving onto the gelato itself. The flavors are pretty innovative and are tasty, but sometimes the consistency is strange. The first time, it was on the icier side, but the second time, the gelato seemed to melt so fast that it was a race to finish the small portion of gelato I was given. In addition, they really don't give you that much for the $5 you pay (it seems that the pictures are mostly taken really close to the gelato), and the flavors aren't that great that I'd be willing to keep spending the money. I would go once or twice for the experience, but that's about it."

For a little over $5, you can get a small cup that can hold up to two flavors. \n\nFlavors I've tried (not including the countless flavors I've actually sampled haha):\n\n1) Thai coconut milk - very refreshing coconut taste especially on a hot day; not an overpowering coconut taste but it is nicely complimented with the milky flavor \n\n2) Champagne mango - think your typical mango taste but toned down a notch. They have a mango flavor as well but their champagne mango is much lighter and less sweet. Pair it with the thai coconut milk, and it'll sure remind you of the mango sticky rice dessert at Thai restaurants! Delicious combo!\n\n3) Hazelnut - one cannot go wrong with hazelnut. One of the best hazelnut flavors I've tried!\n\n4) Chocolate banana - I love chocolate and banana combos and this gelato flavor is divine. It reminds me of chocolate-dipped frozen banana slices...yum!\n\nService is very friendly, and I find myself studying here numerous times a week. They have gelato, coffee, tables, and chill music.

Of the dozens of flavors I've tried (I come here a lot), my favorites are the oscuro dark chocolate, pistachio, sweet Amish milk, and nutella. Usually, a small serving with two scoops is enough to satisfy your gelato craving. \n\nFor coffee lovers, the affogato (espresso over a flavor of gelato) is a nice combination of hot and cold. I also love their rich iced lattes, which are much better than Starbuck's. For hot chocolate lovers, be sure to try the Italian hot chocolate - it's a thick, hot drink topped with decadent whipped cream that you have to eat with a spoon.

The hazelnut \"biaco\" had large ice chunks in it.\nI guess when daddy is throwing money at you to keep you in school; it is the place to go.\nHad better in Europe for  1/2 the price and the views were definitely better."

It's comparable to the gelato from Italy, and if I do say so myself, it even surpasses some of the gelato places in Italy. \n\nFlavors are interesting, rich, and bold. It is pretty apparent that real, fresh ingredients are used. It basically tastes like that ingredient was magically transformed into gelato form. You'll never taste anything that tastes artificial. My favorite flavors include the Cioccolato Scuro (a very rich dark chocolate--almost tastes like a brownie in gelato form), Basil Pineapple, Grapefruit, Pear, and Nutella. The flavors vary daily and seasonally, so you can always try something new. Ask the server at the counter to give you a sample of whichever flavors you are interested to try before you make your final decision. I personally like to mix a fruit flavor with the Cioccolato Scuro. Yes, the gelato comes with a high price tag, but it is totally worth it.\n\nAside from the gelato, Capogiro also makes fabulous drinks like mulled wine and spiked hot chocolate during the winter. For the spiked hot chocolate, you have the option to choose from a variety of liquors--anything from Kahlua to Bailey's to Frangelico and more. If you're not in the mood for something alcoholic, they also make a delicious regular hot chocolate. Don't be scared by the price. The hot chocolate comes with the works--almost three cups worth of hot chocolate (some in your mug and some in a cute little pitcher) along with fresh whipped cream in a separate dish. \n\nSeriously, this is one of the places I miss most now that I've moved away from Philly. I have yet to find a place that can match up to the quality of Capogiro. Everyone needs to go here at least once."

Yum.\nTo tell a longer story, let me say that I lived in Argentina for about half a year, and it is the land of amazing ice cream (sidenote: the Spanish word for ice cream is \"helado\" which seems closer to \"gelato\" than \"ice cream\" phonetically. Not sure where you would categorize what they call \"helado\" on the gelato to ice cream spectrum flavor-wise - it's not quite either. Also, probably the reason it's so good is because of all the Italian immigrants. Basically, what they have there is somewhere between gelato and ice cream, much like at Capogiro...) To the point: Argentine ice cream is the gold standard for me, I have been searching for years for an American equivalent. I have found it at Capogiro!\nCapogiro, first of all, offers you two or more flavors in the same cup. Once you have tried it, you realize OBVIOUSLY more than one flavor together is far superior to just one flavor. Capogiro is the only place I've found here that does it without you asking specially for it!\nAlso, the range of flavors and amazing, delicious texture cannot be beat. Recently I've had there a dark chocolate flavor, burnt sugar, sweet cream, pistachio, coconut [not all at the same time. Over several months.] They let you sample lots of flavors before making up your mind. I just love this ice cream / gelato. If you say it's not really gelato, I just say it's DELICIOUS."

No outlets, and WiFi just doesn't work for me (I know others who have had issues connecting to the WiFi as well). Can sometimes be freezing in the cafe too.\n\nGelato: Delicious flavors that change daily. Some of my favorites include: dark chocolate, pistachio, madagascar bourbon vanilla, and bacio (think nutella!). Have never really tried the fruity flavors, so can't comment on those. Check the website ahead of time to see what the flavors are for that day!\n\nPastries: I've tried the almond croissant, cinnamon roll, and pistachio/nutella roll. All were amazing. The almond croissant is one of my personal favorites-- definitely ask for it to be warmed/toasted! \n\nCookies: The cookies are massive and super tasty. Would recommend.\n\nBrownies: The chocolate/peanut butter brownie is super rich and dense. For the decadent dessert lovers, this one's for you!\n\nSandwiches: I've tried the vegetable toast. In my opinion, it was tasty but nothing to rave about. It is also extremely pricey for the size. I definitely finished mine in like 3 bites.\n\nDrinks: I've had the coffee and teas, and really everything is super tasty. \n\nIn general, prices are HIGH. Small gelato cups are around 5 dollars, sandwiches are around 8-10 dollars, pastries are around 3-5 dollars. That being said, quality is generally higher than what you would find at other on campus cafes. If you are okay with spending a little more money for the added layer of quality, then go for it!"

And even though we were full, one of my friends and I decided to step in.\n\nAnd it was like stepping into dessert paradise.\nThere are tons of different flavours, all with an artisanal vibe to them -- maybe it's the Italian names they give them, maybe it's the font they use on the tags with just the right amount of cursiveness.  W/e.  All you need to know is that THEY ARE DELICIOUS.\n\nIt's like melt-in-your-mouth gelato.

You are welcome to try as many flavors as you like until you've made your selection. The flavors, by the way are a wonderful variety from the traditional to the bizarre but still genius.  Their baked goods are delicious.   Something I just recently had for the first time from there was also wonderful, called  granita, which I would describe as shaved ice made from fresh brewed iced tea."

The decor is better, there are more seats, big windows that let out more light and look out to the park.\n\nIt's true that when it comes to gelato, there's no place in the city better than Capogiro. They managed to retain classic flavors as well as venturing out to more exotic and experimental ones. For the traditionalist, try Bacio which is chocolate hazelnut which resembles good ol' Nutella, Fior Di Latte is made with milk from the Amish in Lancaster. Pistacchio is nutty and silky.  \n\nPersonally, I like the exotic tropical and the experimental. Thai Coconut Milk is soothing and rich, Mango is creamy and sweet. They have a Lime Cilantro that is highly refreshing and addictive and taste half guacamole like with the Avocado. \n\nOccasionally they will have sugar brioche available in which they toast it and cut it in half and serve ice cream inside, which makes for the perfect dessert that I simply adore. Look for it because that will simply blow your mind. Of course, the pricing is a bit on the high side but it's worth it and it can act as a deterrent to eat too much of it and gain weight."

Tasty treats together can't be beat!\n\nCapogiro's gelato is very, very good. The flavors change every day (be sure to check out the website and specify which location you frequent to see what they're serving that day) and they range from classic creamy and fruity to more exotic flavors like sea salt. The scoopers (?) are very generous with giving away samples, which does hold up the line a bit, but I guess it can be forgiven. \n\nI ordered the hazelnut and the Italian chocolate chip. I was also looking into the Nutella but it was so incredibly rich, I didn't know if I'd be able to eat a whole serving. The Thai coconut milk could use a little more touch of coconut. I'd really like to try the Burnt Sugar flavor - advertised as tasting like the top of a creme brulee. Delicious!\n\nI also love that they have a full bar."

You can definitely come in here and sit a while without feeling like you're taking up someone else's precious space.\n\nThe Beer Week gelatos were fantastic, I'm also a fan of the caramel-y flavors and their plain old vanilla flavor. I would caution against their super chocolate flavor as I would say 5-6 of the people I've gone with have ordered this and they never like it that much."

I go here for espresso, not to feel like I am in a nightclub. Perhaps they could get away with this if they were playing soft jazz instead of wide tone range electronica. Aside from this, the ambiance here is one of the nicest in town. \n\nEspresso here is good, but the crema is sometimes lacking, and sometimes the shot is underextracted without the grind being adjusted accordingly to reach the appropriate target volume. They have a great machine though, so with a little more expert training, they could potentially be serving the best espresso in town. \n\nIf a manager or barista is reading this, contact me for more detailed suggestions."

This is one of the best gelato places I've been to in the U.S. \nGo! Try the lime-cilantro and thai coconut milk combo. It might sound odd but the tangy and sweet just work well together, I promise. The dark chocolate is rich and dreamy and paired with cinnamon would be a winning combo. The olive oil tastes just like olive oil, subtle yet quite distinct. The grapefruit is a great palate cleanser. The other flavors I have yet to try. They do change them often, maybe even on a daily basis. They also use local ingredients and are just creative with the flavors. The true flavors really come out and the end product is quality. And one must pay a little extra for quality. I do not mind this, it's worth it for a once-in-a-while treat, but not economical for an everyday indulgence. So it's probably a good thing they are only located in Philly, because I can see myself becoming quite addicted. Oh, and the servers are very generous with giving out samples so don't be shy, try as many as you want! I went to another location last time, this is a newer one, but I enjoyed both."

I didn't try any of that, though - you can get a beer and a sandwich anywhere, but there's only one game in town for pineapple sage sorbetto. And god bless them for it!"

Who cares, it's good.). If you're not sure what you want, you can ask for samples. They also make a decent hot chocolate and ice cream (gelato) sandwich.

Their cannella is MORE CINNAMONY than other cannellas I've had, which is a huge bonus because I love cinnamon. And the goat's milk provided the right balance. The goat's milk is apparently a popular flavor because I took the last scoop of the evening, and it was the first to run out. \n\nThe guy behind the counter though, was not happy when I accidentally threw away my sample spoon instead of keeping it to eat my gelato with.

We stopped at Cap Gelato as a dessert stop at sunset. Aww, how romantic...sharing gelato, like lady and the tramp, but with less fleas.\n\nFor 5.75, we purchased a medium combination of lemon, salted caramel,  and dark chocolate. Not exactly three flavors that go together- but that's what happens when two palates combine in a gelato sampler. All were very good...dark chocolate was very rich, like eating the darkest brownie Betty Crocker can concoct. Speaking of brownies, we also purchased a chocolate chip brownie to support the gelato. A bit dry and crumbly, in my opinion.\n\nBummer was that the coffee service ends at 8 pm, and my dark chocolate gelato was augmented by-gulp-water. Fie! On a college campus, no coffee after 8 pm?

In fact, I'm not even sure how their employees stand it. I'm talking about the chairs. And not their functionality or comfort level, but the fact that when they move across the floor, they screech like a million tortured demons in the seventh circle of hell. It's a terrifying sound, one that makes my blood run cold, and ultimately the reason why I had to pack up my bags and head out earlier than I intended while working at their cafe yesterday afternoon. Hey, maybe that's their tactic for getting people to leave. Probably not, though. Please, Capogiro, I beg - put something on the bottom of those chair legs!"

I got a gift card and finally decided to try a sorbet there.\n\nAfter that, I had to have a dessert on campus every week... it was a bad phase, both for my health and my wallet (I think it's around $5 for two scoops?). I usually get the fruit-based gelatos and sorbettos, and I absolutely love that they post their flavors at each location on their website! Since they tend to rotate their flavors, I check that there is at least one flavor I like before I go over and try some flavors, knowing that there is always something I can fall back on (since I'm pretty picky). Their flavors always taste fresh and delicious! \n\nThis summer, I visited Venice, Naples, Rome, and Florence, and tried gelato multiple times in each of these places. For some reason, I ended up missing Capo. The texture of Capo sorbettos and gelatos, as well as the wide variety of rotated flavors offered (both safe and adventurous mixes, so both picky eaters and more courageous ones have things to eat!) made it great in comparison. (Many small Italian gelato stands only have very basic flavors, and I got lemon everywhere.) So I was all ready to hit up Capo again when I returned to campus in the fall of 2013, when--lo and behold--the cups get even smaller. Now barely any gelato can fit in the cup. Unfortunately, my visits are much more rare now. The gelato is just as good, but it's just not as worth it anymore."

Sometimes I just want to get everything that I would bring a friend to split four flavors with me since I can't eat four scoops of gelato goodness (curse human limitations!). What makes Capogiro special is that its flavors are always on point: I can taste whatever flavor is advertised in the gelato.\n\nThis particular location has WiFi, but no power outlet.
