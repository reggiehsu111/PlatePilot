The wait was a little long but not terrible considering the night rush. I got a large pepperoni and a dozen wings with a side of hot sauce. Everything sounds great right? Pizza tastes good, wings taste good. Me being slightly... buzzed thought nothing of the bill... after all my main mission was to get Pizza. It wasn't until I collected myself this morning that I realized how ridiculous it was that I spent 32 bucks on a pep pizza and a dozen wings. I think you guys can do the math. I got fleeced in my moment of drunkin pizza need. Anyway, go next door. These guys can't operate like decent human beings. I'm sure the owner will read this so my message is: yeah we might be drunk when we order but we remember the next day and apparently this isn't an isolated event according to my friends. Deuces.

My roommates and I often find ourselves thinking about driving up to get some pizza weekly but the 45 minute drive seems to be a bit much just for pizza. Will stop by every time I'm in the area."

After they did not get there in the time frame, I called and they said it was out for delivery and would be there momentarily. Grub hub then updated the delivery time two more times delaying it further both times! It arrived at 8:11. The food was gross - nothing was even warm, let alone hot. It was soggy, not crispy and it all tasted bland- like no taste and over cooked. Order from somewhere else."

They had a few stools we thought we could eat at ..but the place was so cold inside we opted to eat in the car. Like it's the dead of winter an even the woman behind the counter was wearing a coat which is unsanitary. It was sooooo cold the cheese on my burger was not even melted. I'm sure there are other burger joints on main st. Maybe we should have stuck to the pizza!"

I like the dusting of cornmeal on the dough. It gives the crust a nice texture instead of filling your mouth with flour like all the other pizza shops. The crust was thin, cooked light but not soggy, and the ingredient portions were spot on so nothing was overpowering."

Received a roast pork hoagie with jalape\u00f1o peppers, arrabiata pasta with jalape\u00f1o peppers (apparently the italian cherry peppers ran out, though I was told jalape\u00f1os are basically identical), and my soup was spilled all over the bag.  To their credit, they did replace the soup but the food overall was pretty awful.  I was also told to call back so they can make up the order to me (though I was literally currently on the phone with them regarding the current order).  The pork was incredibly fatty and putting jalape\u00f1o peppers in italian pasta is just asinine.  I would not order from here again but maybe by some slim chance the pizza is half decent."

Out of all the pizza places on Main St. in manayunk, this is my favorite by far!"

Because when I attempted to call them they did not answer. I called back the next day and was told they would not refund me because they tried to deliver it, but no one answered the door. Yet, I never heard the knock, my dog never barked (she goes crazy when someone knocks), and I never got the confirmation that my food is on the way (that Grubhub sends when the restaurant confirms via their app that the food is out for delivery). Simply put, they tried to rip me off, which is something they apparently do to their customers on a fairly consistent basis, based on their other Yelp reviews. Luckily, sine I ordered through GH, they refunded me on their own. I am just pissed that I had included a 20% tip when I ordered. This is my only yelp review, in fact, I signed up just to post this. Customers beware!"

Both were hot when they arrived, the delivery driver was friendly and everything was in tact.  The mozzarella sticks did have a thick batter, but it states that on the menu.  I was sad when I found out they were closed on Sunday.  We have been ordering from Mimmo's Pizza for our pasta and while it is \"ok\" we were pleased to know that now can order for DeSandro on Main and enjoy quality fresh food.  Thanks!"

Called at 8:30. Phone number does not work, saying cannot connect from my line, I have at&t unsure if anyone else has this problem...? Finally got ahold of someone from roommates phone, man sounded very unsure saying there was a lot of traffic, and food should be there \"in about 30..maybe... anywhere from 30-45?\" So we repeated that number back to him, he again confirmed. Called back at 9:15. Man answered saying \"look we've just started your food, it's real busy on the roads (side note: other roommates food got delivered from other location around corner from DeSandro, it took ten minutes), should be ready in ten and it'll go out.\" So I ask again, saying it has been 2 hours. Man says there's nothing he can do the food will be there within 45 minutes. 9:40 rolls around. Still no contact. Myself and roommate drive down to store. Streets are bare, cleared of all snow traffic rain/floodwaters, it took us five minutes to drive there. We walk in to a man yelling on the phone and we ask if our food is there. He begins yelling at us saying the food went out already, refused to show us the ticket, or go back and check on the order. Still yelling that the food went out. We head back home. It's now past 10:30 and still no call from a driver, manager, anybody about any status or even that our food or order has been cancelled. These guys are rude to paying customers, and wasted our evening, not even bothering to just tell us the order has been cancelled, still unsure about that since we HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT."

The only people stupid enough or care enough to eat here are all the drunk people across the street when the bar lets out. The three times i ate their was awful. I had the chicken parm.sandwhich and there was barely any chicken. It was dry and no sauce. I went there just to order a small salad and the owner told me i cant buy a small salad unless i buy an entree. I laughed and walked out. This place seems desperate and simply does not put the care and passion in italian food. There are so many delicious places to eat in manayunk right down the street on main. Take the extra 5 minutes of walking and enjoy yourself."

        "text": "Not sure where to start with this one so I guess Ill just take you on a walk thru of my entire experience. When I called to make an order for delivery I was frustrated within the first minute, the person who was taking my order sounded like they were high and what should have been a two minute phone order was almost a 10 minute ordeal. Finally got my food and was immediately upset when I opened the box of pizza and instead of green peppers like I asked for, they were red (okay okay its just a difference in color, no biggie) but also the pizza was barely warm. Weird since I only live two blocks away. Then, my boyfriend unwrapped his italian hoagie. We specifically asked for mayo plus sweet peppers and pickles, none of those items were on the sandwich. After a bite he realized instead of genoa salami they used cold pepperoni slices (in what world do italian hoagies come with pepperoni?) At this point we were both fed up so I decides to walk down the street to get my money back. I walk into the establishment, said excuse me to the man working the front counter and asked if I could speak to a manager. Maybe five minutes later a man from the back emerges and doesnt even glance at me for more than a second but proceeds to ask the person behind me what they need. I raised my voice loud enough to be heard and asked if he was the manager and he said yes. I told him the pizza was cold and the food was all wrong and instead of immediately apologizing like you'd think any self respecting manager would he tries arguing with me about my complaints. Finally after about five minutes and multiple stares from the other customers he agree to give me a full refund of my money. Not only was I upset with who ever made the food, but I was even more upset by the way this 'manager' handled the situation. Honestly I dont want to give this place any sort of good review but Ill give them 1 star ... Only because all they are good for is a sloppy slice of pizza to get you from the bar to your home on a drunken Friday night."

With summer just starting this place is an awesome place to grab a slice and relax alfresco with some beers.  Had the large regular pizza which is probably one of the best values on Main St.  $12.50. Okay cheese and average sauce kind of reminds me of a pizza you'd get at a rollerskating rink or batting cages.  Wings were plays though, had the inferno and they were spicy.  By far though the waffle fries were the best."

Then while I was sitting there waiting for my order I proceeded to watch the counter guy take orders for things not on the limited menu. I asked him about this he said \"sorry man\". Then on top of everything they got the order wrong and the food was just okay. If you are thinking of eating here I suggest you step 30-40 feet down the street to mikes.
