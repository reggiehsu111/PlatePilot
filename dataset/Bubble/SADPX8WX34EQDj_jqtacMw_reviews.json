To make things worse, the meal of two courses cost more than 50. To pile on top of that, it was cash only. \n\nMiss the old Sakura. It was not the tastiest but it offered good value.

Each dish had its unique flavor. \nWe didn't try any spicy dishes. We'll come back for that!\n\nAll dish we ordered were perfectly cooked. It's easy to overcook the pig stomach dish but they did really well! It tasted crunchy and chewy.\n\nLoved the xiaolongbao! The most juicy xiaolongbao I've had in Philly. Probably one of the best out of all xiaolongbao shops I've been to. The size is bigger than what you'd expect, and the skin can be a little thinner.

The beef pancake was sliced beef on white bread. The chili chicken was chilled and served in a warm soup, very spicy but why the heck was the chicken ice cold?

The sauces are good to compliment the flavorful dishes. There was dish that was super extra salty and the staff heard our comment, and was kind enough to return the dish back to the kitchen to exchange for a new one. I would say, do make a reservation in advance if you can, the food takes awhile to come to the table and it isn't like a traditional dim sum restaurant where carts of dishes are rolling by for you to choose - it is more of a la carte menu."

First up, they only accept cash or venmo (which was very weird). The owner/manager is kind of rude (no people skills whatsoever). They charge for soda refills and it's by the can. Ok now that that's outta the way let's get to the food - we ordered appetizers and entrees - both were brought out at the same time even tho we put in for the apps way before the entree. The spring rolls were stale - as though they microwaved it from the night before. There is no flexibility on the menu (for instance, I wanted a different side other than rice - nope, no can do, the manager is really strict... and also the only Side they have is rice). I had the spicy beef and I couldn't even eat 1/4 of it cause it just wasn't tasting good. I ended up having to nibble on the nasty spring roll since it was better than my entree. Oh and the waiter came and took the spring roll away before I finished it without even asking - like wth. I wish I could give this place a negative star because it really did suck. I'm assuming the manager is just trying to cut cost but it's not working. Save your money and go somewhere else."

The waiter reminded us at the entrance immediately that they did not accept credit cards. Only cash and Venmo was accepted. I suppose they want to earn a little extra by not having to pay credit card costs, which is not a customer friendly way of doing business. If you want to earn more as restaurant, then you should improve your service, not cut costs by limiting the customer's options. Luckily we had enough cash with us. The waiter assigned us a table in the back. After a while, we noticed that other customers got water and tea on arrival, but we did not get anything. How can you treat customers differently like that? We are paying the same as everybody else, so we also want the same service as everyone else!\nAnyway, the Taiwanese noodle soup has too many noodles and too few vegetables for my taste. Moreover, half of the meat was skin, which I find chewy and not particularly tasty. We enjoyed the scallion pancakes however."

        "text": "First sign of trouble: We thought we were trying new restaurant but this is actually rebranding of former Sakura Mandarin that occupied the same space, which was a decent place when it first opened many years ago (known initially for its soup dumplings when these were rare to find) but had since become mediocre enough to point that we had stopped eating there. We had already been seated so decided to stay.\n\nSecond sign of trouble: Almost immediately after we placed our order, our pan fried soup dumplings (these are actually little buns) were delivered to the table. They were tepid and clearly had been sitting in the kitchen for a while. There was no soup in the dumplings either (perhaps soaked up by the dumpling dough while they sat in the kitchen).\n\nThird sign of trouble: In contrast to the dumplings, our order of Dan Dan noodles didn't arrive until we were basically finished with our meal and only after asking about its status. By this time, we had already decided that despite the interior makeover (which you will recognize in the innumerable cheap 'hip' restaurants in China if you spend any time there) of new Sakura, the mediocre food quality was as we had remembered it and wouldn't be returning, again. The noodles, which were delivered cold, made sure of it. We brought the cold noodles to the attention of staff, who told us that Dan Dan noodles are served cold. I am Chinese and just returned not long ago from spending a year in Chengdu, where my family ate Dan Dan noodles several times weekly (yes, the real thing is that tasty!) and were never served it cold across dozens of restaurants we visited - there are various cold noodles in Sichuan cuisine but these are types of Liang Mian. There's also the fact that the noodles were served warm when we previously ate it in the restaurant's Sakura days. I switched from speaking English to Chinese and called them out, but they insisted the noodles are served cold. Fed up at the staff's lack of scruples, we returned the noodles and left no tip (first time ever!) to register our poor experience with the restaurant. As we left, the staff angrily chased us about not tipping. I explained we didn't have a good experience. Given one last chance to own up to their lie or even say something like our restaurant's version is served cold, the waiter just called me an asshole."

The interior is cute, and there's no need to make a reservation it seems. Our service was wonderful as well.\n\nFor our meal, we ordered the century egg with eggplant, duck tongue, lamb dry pot, and truffle pork soup dumplings.  We also ordered a pot of red tea that was recommended.\n\nThe duck tongue is hard to comment on, I'm not going to lie we just went out of our comfort zone and tried it since we've never had it. For us, we personally didn't like it but that's not to say it wasn't prepared well!  Everything else was just spectacular - the lamb was spicy and tender and marinated super well.  The soup dumplings were so juicy and the pork was tender - my partner said they could now be his favorite soup dumplings, although next time we'd probably get the regular and not the black truffle as the truffle flavor was slightly overwhelming.  The eggplant and century egg was so good! This we also tried for the first time and loved it, and I really don't know of another restaurant that would serve this. Don't let the egg make you feel put off - it really just tastes like a salty egg. For people who don't know, the dish comes with a pestle that you can use to mash everything together. Don't eat the egg straight! Mash it in with everything else.\n\nThey had a great dessert selection that looks super cute and delicious but unfortunately they were out of everything we wanted to try! I would definitely come back to try other things on their extensive menu, and to expand my horizons more (and hopefully get some of their desserts!). \n\nJust as a heads up, they are cash only and they charge for rice."

If you're looking for true authentic dim sum, then you might want to consider the other dim sum places in chinatown. However, if you're craving some dim sum at like 8pm (which I normally do) then Bai Wei serves enough dishes to satisfy your craving. Although their dim sum options are limited, they are pretty good. I love their appetizers. The scallion pancake, cheese fried wontons and rock shrimp don't sound like anything amazing, but I always have to order these when I go because they're just THAT good. Anytime I come here with friends we always end up ordering soup dumplings. They aren't bad, but they're definitely not my favorite. My partner really enjoys their salt baked squid (which is the dish he orders at EVERY Chinese restaurant so you could say he's a salt baked squid connoisseur). I, on the other hand really love their noodles! I enjoy szechuan food because I like a little spice to my dishes. The dandan noodles and their drunken noodles with beef are my go-to's. I definitely have to come back and try more of their options, but from what I've had so far, I really enjoyed. Their staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is a great place to catch up with friends. Just know that it's cash only, but they also accept venmo, so plan ahead! There's an ATM if you need to grab some cash too."

Being a Chinese from Baltimore I am so jealous of the peps in Philly...\nThe food is authentic. Even the menu is authentically Chinese, you see, it is important to have pictures that go with the name of the item, so anybody can order straight by pointing at the pictures. I am 100% sure their menu will be helpful for the non-Chinese speaking diners.\nWe ordered a steamed sea bass with peppers, beef stew with dry bean curds in a casserole, and hot and sour rice noodles. Really love the fish, very tender and fresh, the peppers that go with the fish are so tasty... \nNot a fan of dry bean curds but the beef stew was really good. The hot and sour rice noodles should not be called \u9178\u8fa3\u7c89 in Chinese, better be \u9178\u8fa3\u7c73\u7c89 since the default idea is the transparent starch noodles instead of rice noodles, but the rice noodles turned out to be too good to be complained: smooth, tender, seem to be fresh-made.\nThe only pain is that now they only accept cash/Venmo --which is a bummer since who would carry 50-100 dollar cash nowadays! If you only expect your customers to spend 10/pp then it is fine, but here is more like at least 20-30/pp. Hopefully they can get their credit card system ready soon."

I think the spicy flavor is the best, if you really can't eat spicy food, just tell them to make it less spicy. \n\nOtherwise, since Sakura changed to Bai Wei, they don't have the sushi bar anymore, but I didn't concentrate on that before. However, they redesigned the restaurant to a more modern style and added more traditional Chinese food with special drinks and French style desserts. I especially love the Triple Chocolate, Matcha Mousse and Cheese Sea Salt Foam series drinks. I will come back to try more foods here!\n\nThe last but not the least is that they still have the spicy dry pot! That was my favorite before! Come to check out.

When a customer comes in, the wait staff would stop eating, sit them down at a table, and then return to their own table to eat.

They only accept cash, venom, or cash app but honestly once you have the food you will not care! Where to start! You have to make a reservation if you do not want to wait because it seems like everyone knows how good their food is, but trust me, its totally worth the wait! We have gone here 3 times in the same week because we (my fianc\u00e9 and I) could not stop thinking about how amazing the food was. And also I was 5-6 months pregnant so that also was a factor ;) We start with the soup, and it was truly the best I have ever had. You can tell that it is fresh and they make the dumplings there because they do not taste like your typical around the corner ingredients. Next up we did the fried dumplings and again, WOW! They were soooo good we ordered a second round. For dinner we had the Truffle beef fried rice and when I tell you I dream about this rice and my mouth waters, I am not joking. I can honestly say that this is the best fried rice I have ever had. We have also tried a few of the sides, but we just kept going back to the rice. The first time there was after the auto show and my fianc\u00e9 ordered the sweet and sour chicken which was also really good. You could tell they batter the chicken there and it is not frozen which is really important. The prices are NOT that bad, I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about. Other places in china town have cheaper menus because you can taste that they use frozen food. Bai Wei does not and it shows! We were so happy and delighted with everything we ordered I can not wait to go back again soon! You HAVE to go! And don't forget about their desserts. I can promise you wont have room left, but make sure you get one to go! And if you're as hooked to the candies you get after your meal like I was, they are guava and you can get an entire bag of them across the street for less than $2!

Our original plan was to go to Dim Sum Garden, but as you might guess, it was packed and the line was insane. I had passed Bai Wei a few times before and was intrigued by their beautiful interior filled with happy looking customers, so we decided to give it a try. Currently, it's cash and Venmo only, which is perfectly fine because they have an ATM at the front. We were seated immediately and the waiter, who was such a sweetheart, suggested a delicious tea, the name of which escapes me now (sorry!). We ordered A LOT of food, and the dishes came out in a timely manner. The crab and pork soup dumplings, in my humble opinion, were better than Dim Sum Garden (*GASP*). In fact, all the food was delicious. So, without further ado, I'll let the pictures do the talking."

The furniture placement is delightful and the chairs are comfortable, table has a great amount of arm space. Food and drinks are delightful and delicious. Bai Wei is definitely a late night restaurant to eat at and the cakes they provide from Ala mousse is easy on the eye and has great structure on each cake, near to perfection if i must say."

This place came recommended to us by good friends, and it did not disappoint! \nWe arrived and there was a short line..about a 10-minute wait. Hostess was kind and handed us a buzzer/beeper.  Informed us that they only accepted cash or Venmo payment. \nOnly frustrating thing about our visit was that it took our waiter a little while to take our drink and food order. But other than that, the service was friendly and prompt.  \nScallion Pancakes--YUM! Crispy and light.  Delicious dipping sauce that we used for the soup dumplings. \nSteamed Pork Soup Dumplings--Delicious! Watch out, they came out SUPER hot.  I didn't care for the dipping sauce--too much vinegar for my taste buds. \nSpicy Stir Fry Pot-- The boyfriend loved this! Ordered this as \"regular\" spicy: flavorful;  he expected  it to be a little spicier, which turned out to be the perfect level of spicy for me to enjoy as well. \nDrunken Noodle with Beef-- Good, solid drunken noodle dish. \nDiced Chicken with Hot Peppers-- This was my personal favorite. I did ask our server to take it to a milder spice level...I will definitely be back for this dish!!\n\nWe will absolutely be back!!"

We ordered multiple orders of scallion beef, kung pao chicken, bao buns, truffle beef fried rice, rock shrimp, pork belly. All excellent.  Our servers were fantastic. We had a great night!

The answer was when above to 6 person and they will just automatically add 18% of tips to the check, no matter if we want it or not. (We are like 9 people)He also said all other restaurant do the same. That's bullshit, I have went so many restaurant such as Cheesecake Factory and Jade Harbor Chinese Seafood Restaurant more and more, they never just automatically put the tips for themselves just because we are  a group of people. I feel like tipping to the server is customer right and depend on how well the server do. Not just force customers to pay for the tip that they wants. I am happy to give the tips but whatever they do just make me feel that I do not wanna tipping. In the future I might think about if I still wanna go there anymore even the food was ok. For the last if you guys are going as a group of people I suggest you do not go there."

The crab soup dumplings have a crab topping. The filling and the broth are bland. The skin is thin on the bottom but terribly thick on top. The vegetable dumplings, bland again. Then there's the sheng jian bao. The filling is bland. The skin seems to be half cooked and the dumplings came out lukewarm to cold. Given that we are talking about Shanghai cuisine which is not supposed to hide behind a ton of spices, heat, fermented products, and sour and salt, it is actually so much more critical that the ingredients stand on their own merits, meaning that the chef has to meticulously personally select even the most mundane ingredients.   In Shanghai and Cantonese cuisine, one is doing the flying trapeze without a net. Corner cutting shows up immediately.  To say, this restaurant is provincial would be to insult the other good restaurants in the area, so this is 2 stars, grading on a curve.  It's also worse than the previous incarnation of the restaurant."

They do have some outdoor seating, which is nicer for the summer time. \n\nI was sitting inside near a window to people watch  and it was nice. The amount of food I ordered needed two tables though - I was hungry. The soup dumplings were filled with soup and that is always a good thing. The flavor of the soup dumplings paled in comparison with other places and the fried fish I just had. Really loves that fish that much.

I know I had the Szechuan beef, which was delicious and tender, the smelly pot with chicken which was also very good, the beef dish with peppercorn was very intense if you bite into a peppercorn, so avoid the peppercorn directly and you'll love it, but the best item I've had so far is the crispy fish, which I don't think is the name of it, but I'll put up a picture so you can order it. I'm not the biggest fan of fish dishes, but I guarantee you that you will love it! I know I did.

There were lots of other Chinese families eating here on a busy Saturday night, which I always take as a good sign for a Chinese restaurant in America (speaking as a Twinkie ;)). Every table was occupied at 7:30 pm-8:30pm. We came in around 7 and waited 20-25 minutes to get a table for a table for 4. This restaurant was very clean.\n\nThis place is cash only/Venmo/Alipay. For a big and higher end Chinese restaurant, it's kind of annoying they don't take credit cards, but maybe this'll change in the future.\n\nThe service was excellent. The waiter refilled our Longjing Tea pot ($5) at least 3-4 times and the restaurant used high quality tea; despite the ongoing 20+ minute wait for tables after 7:30 pm, we never felt rushed during our meal and the service was quick when we received our food. \n\nThis restaurant has excellent authentic/traditional tasting xiao long bao soup dumplings - I would argue they were as good tasting as the ones you find at Nan Xiang in Flushing NY! My boyfriend happily devoured the XLB. The pan-fried pork soup dumplings were great texture-wise (there's a bit of an extra \"crunch\" at the bottom of them), but only good/okay taste-wise (the meat filling is more savory-tasting than slightly sweet/salty like at some other Shanghai-cuisine restaurants - also, I didn't really taste much of the \"soup\" that was supposed to be in these (but the dough was a little thicker/heartier like in regular bao-zi, so maybe it just absorbed the soup). The vinegar/ginger that came with the XLB was great.\n\nWe also had a more traditional dish, pickled cabbage soup with tilapia ($28), that was fantastic! The soup came with a whole fish that was de-scaled. The broth had a rich, creamy texture with a deep flavor that clearly showed they used fresh, live fish in their soup and it was a huge portion for the 4 of us. This was my favorite dish in terms of flavor/depth and my Caucasian boyfriend (who can sometimes be hesitant/not-super-adventurous when it comes to Chinese food) was pleasantly surprised and even enjoyed this soup - he ate a huge portion of it.\n\nThe salt/pepper double delight fried squid & shrimp dish was also great - the batter was light and crunchy and not too heavy/oily, so I didn't feel like we were eating ourselves into a greasy food coma like some other restaurants that serve this dish. We also had the eggplant with garlic sauce and this dish was also made well - a little sweeter and not spicy enough for my own personal taste, but the texture of the eggplant was firm/cooked well and it was a good-sized portion for the 4 of us. Pretty reasonably priced meal for the 4 of us that came out to approximately $102 with tax & 18% tip with 1 tea pot, 2 XLB orders, 1 pan-fried XLB dish, 1 huge multi-portion fish soup, 1 veggie dish and 1 protein dish.\n\nI would definitely come here again! Thanks for the awesome dinner with my family and boyfriend :D"

We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food and service was. But, for us, the downsides outweighed the positives. Although the food tasted good, the portions were so small. Usually, Chinese restaurant gives customers large serving sizes--which is what we expected when we ordered--but we were shocked at how small of a size the servings were. From what we saw, either the food was overpriced or the servings didn't meet the exceptions set by the price. Rice was free but it was served in the smallest rice bowl I have ever seen in my life. I would recommend going here if you're alone but never with friends or in a group because you'll spend more than $50 before you feel like you're full. \nAlso, they alone accept cash or Venmo as payment"

Where the focus was formerly on excellent xiao long bao and other Shanghai delights, it has now expanded to include a strong taste of Szechuan and Hunan pepper and black bean hot dishes. I quite liked the old house, and returned late last week to see what the newly imagined kitchen held in store.\n\nFrom our exploration of the two dishes we ordered, it would appear Bai Wei (many tastes) has it going on.  Their takes on crispy spicy chicken and cumin lamb dry pot were excellent. The chicken was loaded with red Szechuan peppers and small morsels of deep fried chicken. Enough to give our tongues a sincere capcesin workout and loosen our sinuses; stopping just short of bringing on tears. Completely addictive. The lamb, tender in a mix of chopped onion and more peppers and overwhelmed with a dusting of coarse cumin seed. Delicious. About as good as the best Szechuanese bowls I've found in the USA.\n\nThe only downside was the continuing attempt by the staff at up selling our order. We were repeatedly asked about appetizers, drinks and rice - even after we declined multiple times. Sure, they want more money per customer, but it became excessive and annoying. \n\nBut for that weird dynamic, we thoroughly enjoyed the meal.

I came by Bai Wei after the line at Dim Sum Garden was too long for my group, and we were seeking other options for soup dumplings on a Saturday night. I was pleasantly surprised by my experience! Bai Wei has upgraded from the previous decor, with modern light installations and beautiful ceramic bowls lining the walls. The wait for our group of 10 was less than 30 minutes at prime dinner time on a weekend. We ordered $120 of food, which was more than enough for us all to feel stuffed. The standouts were the scallion pancakes, which were buttery and flaky, as well as the house special with pork, egg, and vegetables. I will say that the soup dumplings are not the best in the Chinatown. They broke easily, and the meat was not as flavorful as I would have liked. The fried soup dumplings had no soup inside, which was also disappointing. However, the service was decent, although we were seated at the same time as another large group, so it took a while for all of the food to come out. BYO, so bring beer or wine! They accept venmo (1 transaction per table) and cash only. Overall, worth adding to the rotation for a meal in Chinatown!"

We went for restaurant week; 4 courses for $35 a person so I can't speak of the price. Food was GOOD! Lots of people raves about the soup dumplings which I got but I liked my partners rock shrimp more. Service was very fast despite some previous reviews claiming it is slow. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because the servers did some serious hovering and also took my chopsticks away and proceeded to give me 5 forks throughout the meal. I know I'm about as white as they come but I at least deserve the chance to fail on my own using the chopsticks before swallowing my pride and asking for a fork! But the food was very good and I will certainly go back."

The staff are attentive and the food comes out in a reasonable time.\n\nWhen you order food from here I feel like it could be very much a miss or hit depending on your palate. The shrimp, double cooked pork, and dumplings were amazing! Savory with just the right amount of sauce to not overpower or make the food slimy. The stir fried radish with egg can be a pretty big miss for some. They use the yolk of salted eggs to make it creating a very meat and savory flavor with a slight gritty texture.\n\nOverall for me it was a decent meal. Very filling and lots of food. The price wasn't too bad either. A great place to come and try out once in a while."

When we sat down some guy came over to us and said \"hello\" unenthusiastically. He didn't say anything else. We said hi back and it was a little awkward until my girlfriend said we would like some water. \n\nWe ordered dim sum and scallion pancakes that were recommended by the server. Dim sum is supposed to be ready to go when you order it but we waited like twenty minutes for it. They brought out what appeared to be Worcester sauce and ginger immediately but nothing else for a while. The food was just okay. The pancakes were pretty greasy and not very good. Dim sum was really hot but at least it wasn't bad. The menu was pretty expensive for what it was. Entrees priced around $16. If they were as good as everything else, definitely not worth the money.\n\nIt got pretty crowded and loud so we paid and left.

Loved the vegetarian dishes like eggplant and string beans. The beef soup had really good glass noodles which a great spice kick in the soup. The chicken was also quite spicy (make sure you don't accidentally eat the peppers if you have a low spice tolerance!!!) We also ordered the thousand year egg, which came with eggplant. It was fun to mash it-they give you a pestle to mix the ingredients of the egg, eggplant and sauce together. That was probably my favorite dish because it was so rich with flavor. It's the move to eat family style eating here because the portions are so large, and you can try out all the various dishes they offer. The menu is large so try not be too overwhelmed.

Situated on the outskirts of philly chinatown, I completely missed this location the past times I visited Philly . \n\nWe got the sizzling Japanese tofu with shrimp, beef in spicy chili sauce, and the chinese water spinach. Let's say I now see the reason why they like this place so much.\n\nFirst of all I have not yet found any other place that serves Japanese tofu in either Philly or DC, and it was one of my favorite childhood dish. Seeing the sizzling Japanese tofu on the menu already hyped me up, and I was definitely not disappointed by the taste of it either. It definitely brought back memories of when I had this in China.\n\nThe beef in spicy chili sauce was perfectly within my spice tolerance range. The beef slices were really tender and easy to chew, and the flavor of the sauce really seeped in as well. I even enjoyed eating the bean sprouts on the bottom. Personally I do wish this dish was less salty, especially for this genre of Sichuan spice dish. \n\nThe competition for authentic chinese food in Philly Chinatown is fierce, but I would still recommend giving it a try. It definitely checked all the checkmarks for a tasty Sichuan meal for me."

We were in and out in 35 minutes \n\nFood:\nScallion pancake- unlike your conventionally doughy, decadent scallion pancake you get, this was cracker thin, buttery, with a delightful crisp.\n\nBlack truffle soup dumplings- they were ok. The texture of the actual dumpling was adequate, being robust enough to encase the insides safely. The porky soup of the dumpling, though, was lacking that rich umami flavor I long for in a soup dumpling, rendering this dish inert for me.\n\nBlack truffle, beef fried rice- I can see why there is some fanfare for this dish. With the truffle, it adds this mystical flavor profile that I can't really pinpoint, but is tantalizingly yummy. \n\n\nIn actuality, I'd give them a 4.5.

        "text": "There's like, a 20% surcharge on their grubhub prices which I didn't realize was there until I dined in last week for the first time, so I recommend NOT USING GRUBHUB for Bai Wei. Even for a cash/venmo only restaurant, 20% is a little insane. A dish I paid $18 for on grubhub was only $15 on the menu, and the fish I got on Wednesday that cost me $16 at the restaurant is listed at $20 on grubhub! And that's not counting if you then pay for delivery and tip your delivery driver.\n\nBut anyway, on to the food. The first time I got sizzling Japanese tofu and shrimp off grubhub, it looked nothing like another reviewer's picture, the shrimp were tiny \"medium\" sized shrimp barely the size of a nickel (why grocery stores call those medium shrimp and then have to go up to large, extra large, and then jumbo, I'll never understand, marketing, I guess), there were some diced carrots and onions which were undercooked, and the entire dish was orange and tasted of, what I guess I'd call \"shrimp blood\". Now, my mom uses fresh head-on shrimp in her pork steamed buns  and it's great, but when she tried to do the same trying out a chiang fun recipe, it was an orange disaster. In a dish that's more mild such as tofu, using head-on shrimp is more disaster territory than a good idea, just stick with headless frozen shrimp please. Japanese tofu is always tasty though, no matter how bad you screw up the rest of the dish, so I still ate the whole thing.\n\nBut because TT Skewer and I are forever starcrossed (that's another story), I decided to give Bai Wei another chance, and I'm glad I did (and not just because I caught the grubhub thing). I got fish fillet in spicy sauce (\u6c34\u716e\u9c7c and the server had to verify I wanted the spicy dish and not literally boiled fish, which was topkek). And now, the only restaurant I've ever had this at served it with tofu and peanuts which is about as far from traditional as you can get, so my perception of this dish is way out of whack. Bai Wei does it more typically with cabbage and bean sprouts and it was equally good and I felt healthy getting some vegetables in.\n\nThe server did not stop by at all during my meal because I was all set with a gigantic pot of tea and it's typical in China to flag down waiters rather than wait for them to come to you (my parents HATE it when servers pop by to ask how we're doing), but within a few minutes of finishing eating and pulling out my phone, a server came by to ask if I was finished, so I assume they're relatively attentive and quick to respond, so just don't be shy you'll be fine at Bai Wei. \n\nThe white furniture and elevated dining area is also pretty cute, so I'd dine in again sometime, just not grubhub, never mix grubhub and this place."

I would say that the quality is just okay.  The variety is the draw here and they also offer a 10% Yelp check-in offer.  The staff are fiendly but they seem very rushed as it was quite busy and there were only 2-3 waiters in the entire restaurant serving all the tables and taking takeout orders as well. \n\nCash and Venmo only!\n\nA recap of the dishes:\n1. Sweet osmanthus and sesame mochi dumpling soup: This was perfectly light, sweet, and refreshing with thin shreds of osmanthus and egg whites.  The dumplings were fluffy and filled with sesame.  They are smaller than normal but each was  perfectly balanced bite of filling to shell.\n2. Crabmeat and pork soup dumplings: These were kind of meh with a thick shell and barely any soup and filling.  Maybe it was an off-day but I would suggest the other pan-fried options instead.\n3. Pan Fried buns: These were better than the soup dumplings but the filling was pretty sparse and definitely could have been more generous in portion.  4. Pan fried dumplings: These were solid with a plump, juicy filling and nicely crispy pan fried shell.\n5. Chive buns: Nice nd crispy with a flavorful egg and chive filling.  The only thing that would have made them better would have been some vemicelli inside but pretty solid overall.\n6. Stir-fried clams: Pretty flavorful clams albeit small ones.  It's a bit on the salty side but still pretty solid.\n7. Plum spare ribs: Fried sweet spareribs with sweet plums.  Overall, a nice appetizer-sized option (the ribs are small).  The meat is flavorful and pretty tender but the dish itself is not very filling so this is more of a starter vs an actual main entree.\n8. Seafood tofu casserole: Mostly light silkn tofu with 3 prawns, some fishballs, and 3 pieces of surimi.  This is very light but the seafood portion was tiny.  The nice part is that it isn't oily at all but it's definitely not your traditional seafood hot pot.\n9. Seafood udon: Stir fried udon with seafood in a traditional brown oyster-soy.  This was pretty standard but it was branded as a Shanghai stir fried thick noodle and it resembled more of a Japanese stir-fried udon.  It was just okay but a bit salty.\n10. Marinated sliced roast beef: This was just okay.  The beef was tender but slightly dry and didn't have that sweet and savaory marinade that is the hallmark of the 5-spice Shanghainese beef.\n11. Seasonal stir-fried vegetables: This was light and refeshing and surprisngly one of the best dishes with sliced lotus, cauliflower, broccoli, snow peas, mushrooms, woodear, carrots, and asparagus.  There was just a very slight coagulation of the corn starch thickener on some pieces but they were very busy tonight and likely understaffed in the kitchen so they were likely making this in a rush."

I loved the butter sauce with just a hint of spice. They also put corn on the cob and potatoes in the butter sauce. It's so good. The staff were all masked and gloved and we were given sanitary wipes and plastic gloves to eat with. Also, the outdoor seating area was very cute, with sunflowers and string lights."

It was that good we tried to eat here two nights in a row. The restaurant is very big and clean inside. Staff was friendly and quick with the food. We ordered the scallion pancake, steamed crabmeat and pork Soup dumpling, and drunken noodle with shrimp. Everything was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend was obsessed with the drunken noodle and I'm tied between the noodle and soup dumplings. The total was $25, which was mind blowing because it came with a lot of food. Check this place out!!"

Bai Wei has been saved in my collections for a while now & I'm glad to say I finally made my way here (though it wasn't planned)!\n\nArrived shortly before closing and although you can tell they were preparing for that, the waiter was super nice and took his time attending to my guest & I. \n\nWe ordered the Shrimp & Vegetables dumplings along with two separate orders of fried rice. Even though I am not a beef fried rice fan, I decided to try their Beef Fried Rice with Black Truffle. TBH! The idea of truffle in fried rice did not sound all that appealing, but since the waiter recommended it I decided to go with his suggestion. Thank God! Because, WOW! I have never had anything like it. If you ever get a chance to visit Ba Wei, I would highly suggest trying this dish out. \nThe dumplings were also pretty good. \n\nFairly priced, located in Chinatown and the decor is super chic and modern. Would definitely recommend (However, bring cash because they were not taking cards at the time.)"

They don't accept credit cards, so cash (or some Chinese payment like wechat pay, etc).  One of the fish dish we ordered looks like an appetizer size, the container is only like half full.  And even though we ordered 6 full dishes, there is no white rice; the server told me they never include rice (unless you pay for it); this is kind of strange, I haven't been to any Chinese restaurant that does that.  \n\nOn the pro side, the service is pretty fast; my order is ready within 20 minutes and they texted me to pick up."

I had to take away 2 stars because the servers took awhile to come take our orders (about 10 mins). We made eye contact with them but they just ignored us. When we finally ordered, we also wanted to order Spicy stir fry bowl which requires a separate menu paper to fill in what we want in it. They handed us that paper but it took another 10 minutes for them to come pick it up. I had to wave them down to get their attention. When we got our orders, it took another while to get the stir fry bowl and by that time, our other main dishes were done. \n\nSadly, the spicy stir fry bowl wasn't what it used to be when the restaurant used to be called Sakura. \n\nThe crab soup dumplings were good though. \n\nOnly complaint is slow service even though it wasn't overly busy and they had a good handful of servers around."

I know this sounds ridiculous to say but there is such thing as too much spice. The Tofu soup was good initially, but there was way too much ginger in it. The Chinese Sausage with Leeks was borderline inedible due to how salty it was. It was so salty that we packed about 3/4 of it to go and washed it with water at home to eat it so we didn't waste any food. The only thing we really enjoyed was the cold beef dish that was actually pretty good. \n\nI do want to compliment them on their service. The key to hospitality isn't the food, though it's a key component obviously, it's how an establishment treats their patrons and this place does a wonderful job. We'd go back on this alone and try some other dishes.\n\nOverall, okay food with great service considering they seemed like they were short staffed for obvious reasons. We still loved the night out because no one should take that for granted anymore."

Everything we ate tonight was delicious, but the food we ordered the first time was way better. Tonight we ordered the pork wonton in chili oil, steamed shrimp and vegetable dumplings, saut\u00e9ed seafood noodles and diced chicken w/hot pepper. The pork wonton was good, but the chili oil wasn't what we expected. It had a nice kick to it and also a strong peanut taste. The sauce was good and I wish I could've saved some because it would've been good with noodles, rice or anything really. Strong peanut taste so if you're not about it maybe skip this dish. We both agreed that the shrimp and vegetable dumplings was the best thing we had tonight. It was so good!! Saut\u00e9ed seafood noodles was nice because they were very generous with the assortment of seafood, BUT drunken noodles was 100% better. Seafood noodles were very wet drenched in sauce and was nothing mind blowing. The drunken noodles w/shrimp was out of this world and we also just prefer the wide noodles. Diced chicken was good, but also wasn't something we expected. It was a bit overpriced compared to everything else on their menu. $14 for the entree and 50% was all hot pepper flakes and 50% was small fried popcorn chicken. Tasty but we both dipped it in the dumpling sauce because it was fried and needed a tad bit more flavor. Everything was still delicious, but the food we ordered the first time was way better. Will definitely come back again to try more items. This place is byo so don't forget to bring some drinks!"

Bai Wei's restaurant week menu offered three courses plus dessert but we decided to order a la carte. The appetizers - pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, chicken in diced red pepper, the typical Chinese staples were decent, nothing out of the ordinary but the entrees truly sets them apart from other Chinatown haunts. With a terrific range of options, we got to experience a great range of Chinese food from Shanghai to Sichuan and more. \n\nThe fish filet with peppercorn was one of the best fish dishes I've had in a while. The smelly pot with chicken and sichuan sauce scores high on presentation and taste.  The dish has 'smelly' tofu, hence the name. You can choose to order this with less spicy sauces if you have a low tolerance for spice. The Japanese tofu and shrimp is another standout. The food is authentic, there are dozens of options, the portion sizes are huge and the experience in the end was very gratifying. The service was not quite at the same level but on this day, thus turned out to be a minor glitch in a hugely satisfying experience."

After another excellent experience, I wanted to get a review in.\n\nBai Wei offers a selection of Szechuan and Dim Sum.  While the dumpling and dim sum selection is limited, what they have is amazing.  Of course I'm going to tell you to get the crab and pork soup dumplings!\n\nOn the Szechuan side, you have all sorts of dry pot, stir fry, and pepper based dishes.  My top recommendation is the Lamb (or Beef) Cilantro. It was a hit for our group of six this weekend.  A dish I was surprised I loved so much was their assorted mushrooms.  The cumin dry pot is tasty and not as spicy as I suspected it would be and the eggplant is another solid order, especially for vegetarians. \n\nService is polite and quick.  Since Bai Wei is also a BYO, they won't rush you out as you relax to finish whatever it is that we brought.  Worth noting, they only accept cash or venmo!"

I'm not sure how they make their tea, but it was really really strong rose flavor--very unpleasant because it didn't taste natural. It tasted like potpourri. I had to add water to make it enjoyable. Rose tea should have a nice smooth rose flavor!!! \n\nSoup dumplings. I normally don't order this and restaurants that don't specialize in it. The crab and pork ones were cheap so I tried it out. These were ok. Good amount of crab compared to other places. The soup wasn't too flavorful and the dumpling skin was somewhat thick. \n\nI ordered a noodle with pork sauce. Sometimes this dish gets bad translations so you might get something different than expected... This was one of the times. I thought it would be Zha Jiang Mian, but I think they served me Dan Dan noodles. It had a strong sesame seed/peanut taste so that's why I think it was Dan Dan noodles. Portion was good, but if this was considered Dan Dan noodles, it lacked flavor. \n\nOrdered a fried chicken with chili. I forget the name. This was pretty good. I would order this again. \n \nFood took awhile which was fine bc it was soft opening. The soup dumplings I figure would take the longest but that came out first. The noodles took a long time to come out, so that's why I think they served me Dan Dan noodles and not Zha Jiang Mian. However, if I'm wrong, please let me know! \n\nOn food and service, I would rate it 3 stars. It was just ok. Im talking away 1 star for something that shouldn't have happened. \n\nThe restaurant had about 6 tables full. A server was moving plates/napkin/chopsticks to make room for another table. She DROPS the chopsticks on the floor. She picks it up and places it back on the table. .  \n\nI'm Asian so I'm not usually bothered by this stuff but for a new restaurant to do this IN FRONT of people eating is not good. If we were in Asia, that's culturally acceptable, but in America, we should have better standards. I'm stating this so the owner can train the staff better. \n\nI'll visit again, bc they had some interesting looking dishes that other restaurants don't have."
