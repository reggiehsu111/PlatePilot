The chirashi was just ok as well as the Taiwanese chicken. The calamari was too breaded and couldn't taste the squid inside, the rolls were too small and the waffle with green tea wasn't good. My friends and I really have NOTHING good to say about the place despite us going over the food/any redeeming factors over and over.\n\nNow to the finale, this is what happened:\n1) Friend notices a mouse in little space between outside and inside door \n2) We get grossed out but took a picture of it and immediately notified the management \n3) Management came over to take a look and ignored it for a good ten mins\n4) Some bald guy goes outside with an iPhone (for light) and a FLAME THROWER (the kind you use to melt the top of creme brulee and tries to burn the poor mouse (WHY COULDNT YOU JUST USE A BROOM TO SHOO IT OUT as the first solution instead of trying to light it up?!) \n5) Man lights up the mouse's tail but mouse is too scared to leave (duh)\n6) Man opens up the door and starts to use a broom and mouse runs back and forth and doesn't go outside bc it's hiding behind the ATM machine\n7) Another guy comes out with a broom and tries to shoo it out and still it's not budging.\n8) Finally mouse runs and the bald man traps it in the corner with his foot. Then he STOMPS ON IT 3x!!!!!! Instead of holding it with foot and just shoo it with the broom bc he was so pissed.\n9) We record all of this and get super grossed out and sad that we thought they killed this little animal unnecessarily\n\nBUT THERE IS A TWIST AND IT GETS WORSE.\n10) Other man tries to sweep mouse out to street and mouse starts trying to run bc it turns out that the mouse was only seriously injured and not dead\n11) THE MOUSE IS LITERALLY ON THE STREETS ALREADY, the bald man chases after it and whacks it repeatedly AS HARD AS HE CAN until it's dead.\n12) The mouse is dead with its guts on the street now and he sweeps it to the mounds of garbage bags. PURE Brutality? I'm not a mouse lover but this story sounds pretty shitty, right?\n\nHEY BUT GUESS WHAT THE STORY DOESNT END HERE.\n\n13) The second man comes into the restaurant and has the NERVE to come over to us and says VERBATIM 'hey, the mouse came from the outside, not the inside. I saw you recording, can you delete...'\nI CUT HIM OFF right away. I said also verbatim 'what's on our phones is our property and we will do what we wish with it, please give us the check'\nOk #1 what makes you think you don't need to apologize for us witnessing all of that? #2 why do you think you can ask us to delete our videos and pictures?! Doesn't even make sense!!!\n\nTHEN ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS, they gave us a measly 10% off our bill thinking it'd be ok. We aren't asking for a free meal nor did we ask for any of this but if you're gonna comp anything, 10% is nothing. Please. A measly small apology when we were still at the restaurant before we just left.\n\nI posted all the pics/videos as soon as we walked out  and have gotten an email from the owner. My friends and I have discussed at full length (like actually 1+ hour) on what to do and we decided that it was best to let the Yelp community what happened. It made us super sick, disgusted, and really upset after we left because of what we saw. Definitely one of the worse restaurant experiences we've all ever encountered. Not ok."

The fish was super fresh, the chirashi bowl was delicious and well worth it (12-13 pieces of sashimi), tuna princess roll was delicious and well done!  I do agree with most people that their teas are sweeter than expected so I went with 50% sugar and it was perfect for me (side note: I don't like sweets too much, so it may depend on how much sugar you like).  Definitely our new place close by for sushi!"

Our mouths watered all day at pictures of Instagram-Worthy drinks and beautifully plated sushi. Alas, we couldn't control ourselves and set out to Bubblefish. \n\nUnfortunately, it was not quite the experience that we anticipated. Bubble fish is either understaffed, under-experienced, or some combo of the two which left service to suffer. \nJudging by other reviews, we can assume that the service is much better when they're less busy. \n\nChinatown is becoming an increasingly popular area for weekend nightlife, so if they wish to compete with the Dim Sum Garden's and Banana Leaf's of the world, they're going to have to get it together when things get a little busy. Lucky for them, their drinks, sushi, and young, hip atmosphere give Bubblefish a fighting chance. \n\n**note: CASH ONLY**\nOverall Ratings (1-5)\nService  1\nAmbiance  3\nSpecialty Rolls  5\nDrinks 4\nOnigiri  3\nTaiwanese Salted Chicken  1\nExperience  3\n\nCONs\n\n1) We didn't get water until at least 30 minutes after being seated despite multiple attempts. \nA manager (such a sweetheart) hinted to a shortage of glasses so at least it wasn't a result of poor customer service. \n\n2) Our 'Taiwanese Salted Chicken' was a tad suspect... It seemed a bit dark. We weren't sure if it was supposed to be dark or the result of old oil. However, more alarming than the color was the texture of the chicken. The internal temperature was about 10 lucky seconds past salmonella paranoia-- a bit gamey to say the least. It reminded us of $5 General Tsos from the local Panda Express, minus the Tso Sauce. \n\n3) The staff seemed a bit disorganized and may want to consider investing in an electronic reservation system so that each server knows exactly what tables are theirs to focus on. Openable is absurdly expensive but management should totally check out SeatMe by Yelp!\n\n4) Our server (at least we think she was our server ... it wasn't very clear) came to our table TWICE within our brutally long, 2.5 hour dine-- once to take our orders and once to collect her tips. \"J\" was certainly not her biggest fan; although, to giver her the benefit of the doubt, she didn't seem all that experienced. Either that or she just sucked?\n\n5) They don't have enough seating for groups of 5 or more, so things were a bit cramped. Our 5 person party was placed at a table that was definitely made for 3-- 4 if you're lucky. \n\nPROs\n\n1) The sushi was pretty darn good-- our favorite being the Bubblefish Roll. The price and the portions were perfect for 5 greedy, broke college students. There wasn't too much rice, and they really loaded on the fresh fish! \n\n2) The drinks were sooo yummy!! They measure up to the pictures in every way. \n\n3) Our subpar service was not overlooked by one employee in particular. We think she may have been a manager or the owner. She gave us a sincerely warm apology without us having to bring anything to the staff's attention."

Very comfortable atmosphere, delicious food, and reasonable prices! \nIt's a great place to hang out with friends/family. \nUpon request, they have a separate  room that can accommodate private parties!\nI gave this restaurant five stars because not only is the food amazing, but you can tell that they are really putting in the effort to please the customers as I have found a lot of restaurants don't care nearly as much. \nI have been there several times since their grand opening just a few months ago. \nI highly recommend ordering the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. It tastes amazing and it's not as salty as most can be.  \nAbsolutely you should try their Bubble teas, the sweetened just perfect for me , not like other bubble tea stores that I have always to ask 50% less of sugar . especially sea salt froth green tea with Oreo Crumb on top that you must try.\nI also love their sushi. It's very fresh and not many places can say the same!  Trust me on this review!  You will NOT be disappointed!"

        "text": "I visit Chinatown frequently and try to look for new places to eat. Bubble fish has been open for a bit so my husband and I decided to try it this go around. We had a few questions on the menu since it was our first time. When we asked our waitress about some of the items she answered with one word without any details to help us make a decision.  \n\nWe ordered the Taiwanese crispy chicken which was ok. The seasoning was not mixed very well. You could see loads of seasoning on one piece of chicken but then none on the other. My husband had also ordered the honeydew milk tea since the restaurant is known for its teas. It was chalky and lukewarm, not iced, so it definitely didn't live up to its hype.  We ordered three sushi rolls and they were all mediocre. The rice was mushy which made the entire sushi piece mushy when eating it. \n\nOur waitress also consistently reached over us to grab items like our menus, plates, etc and never asked us how we were doing. And because she never came to check to see how we were doing, we went to pay at the register. Unfortunately, the workers at the register were distracted by talking about other customers that it took a long time to get their attention so we could pay. \n\nOverall, we were not impressed and disappointed that we weren't able to experience what gives this place its ratings."

        "text": "One word - underrated. Sure, the spotlight outside might be trying to attract attention, but for me, it was a calling. Overall, this is a chic and casual japanese restaurant with comfortable seating, upbeat and sick music, an impressive menu, and late hours (open till midnight, 1 AM on weekends). \n\nLet's start with the drinks. There are various \"bubblefish specials\", from which I tried the lavender oolong milk tea. It was delicious, substantial, and the boba was soft and chewy. They also use lactaid milk for their drinks (shout out to all the lactose-intolerant peeps). There are at least 3 pages of drink options to choose from, ranging from oolong teas, black teas, green teas, hot teas, juices, milk shakes, and smoothies. While it was just my first outing, looking at the other drinks from surrounding tables, I was tempted to order more...\n\nFor food, I tried the tonkotsu don, taiwanese beef noodle soup, and a couple of specialty sushi rolls. The tonkotsu don is a helluva dish - you get a big pork cutlet katsu (perfectly crunchy on the outside with juicy meat) upon a bed of white rice sitting in a castiron. Great value meal at $12 and filling. The beef noodle soup was rich and had great flavor. However, they use thin beef slices (which were kind of tough) instead of the traditional beef chunk cubes. The signature sushi rolls have plenty of flavor, mainly because they often come with tempura, some avocado or fruit, and a miso or spicy mayo sauce. \n\nOf note, they also have \"Bubblefish boxes\" (around $13-14), which come with a protein teriyaki of your choice, with california roll, shrimp and vegetable tempura, vegetables, and rice. I saw a few tables that ordered these boxes, and they looked massive!\n\nI would definitely check this place out, there is bound to be something on the menu to make a great meal for anyone!"

        "text": "FYI: Not really a tip but shout out to their interior designer. The aesthetics of the place are amazing.\n\nWHAT WE GOT: salmon tacos, miso salmon, sushi/sashimi platter for one\n\nPROS: Their food is absolutely delicious. I'm a huge fan of the miso salmon combination platter I ordered, which came with this side of stir fried veggies. Everything was seasoned beautifully and cooked really nicely as well. The flavors really complimented the salmon, which by the way, was absolutely amazing. The fish was still moist and retained so much of the soy-miso glaze they put on it. The whole dish was the perfect balance of sweet and savory on a bed of rice. My sister also loved her sushi platter. The presentation was gorgeous and the fish that I got to taste (salmon and yellow tail) were both incredibly fresh.\n\nCONS: Our waitress was super nice and friendly but after we were done our food, we literally sat there waiting a solid 20 minutes before we even flagged someone down to bring us the check. Then it seemed like all of a sudden, our table didn't exist and no one would come and take the check back with my card to pay for the food. Like I made eye contact with our waitress TWICE and watched her meander around at the front by the cash register but she never showed up at our table again. Again, I had to flag someone else down to pay for the food. Like lady...you're not done with your table until they get up and leave the restaurant. Don't be standin there talkin to people when your customers are trying to pay."

I had asked the waitress to please not add any sauce or bonito flakes on the rice ball since it's for our 3 year old and instead just have a tiny bit of the sauce on the side.  She actually said that would cost us extra! And when my shrimp tempura roll came, it barely had any sauce on it.  When I pointed it out and requested for a little bit more, instead of giving me a little dipping sauce on the side like more places do, she asked to take my plate and brought out it to get tiny bit more sauce. \n\nOverall the place had great food and ambience. But come on, don't be so stingy with the sauces!"

        "text": "I had a really bad experience coming here this past week. My friends and I came here to get some late night grub on a wed night around 930pm. Chinatown places are usually the only places open later on weekdays. \n\nWe were seated by the window and asked the waiter if they took credit card. He said it was cash only because their credit card machine wasn't set up yet. So remember cash only for now. They have an atm machine though in case you need it. We ordered a decent amount of food for the group of 4 ppl we had. I got the fried calamari ($7ish) and chirashi (sashimi over rice)- $16. This place is probably on the pricier side for chinatown but since I got sashimi I'm not really complaining about that. The food wasn't that great- the fried calamari didn't really have any flavor. The chirashi had like 3 pieces of a couple different fishes and was average. After we were done eating the waiter asked us if we wanted more tea. We said yes but then he never came back and we had to ask someone else to get us more tea. At this point I would say I would have given this place between 2-3 stars.\n\nNow the nightmare begins...my friend sees a mouse run into the restaurant from outside. The mouse runs inside between the two entrance doors. It's basically trapped between the two doors running around. Now I know the mouse didn't come from inside because it ran from the trash outside. I'm not saying the restaurant isn't clean because it seemed like it was. The way they handled the mouse situation was a bit appalling. We saw the mouse and mentioned it to the staff who didn't really do anything about it initially. They just stood around while the mouse ran around in between the doors- it was pretty gross. My friend took a picture and that's when they started doing something about it. It was super gross like I don't understand why they didn't do anything about it when we mentioned it because customers have to walk out of those doors to exit...\n\nThe one guy comes to try to get the mouse outside but to no avail. That's when he started using a mini flame thrower...I felt like the mouse's tail caught on fire....it was insane. I feel like they could have just used a broom and shooed it outside. So the first guy uses a flame thrower then the 2nd guy traps it with a broom against the wall. First guy then proceeds to stomp on the mouse against the wall. The windows are clear so you can see everything by the way. They finally manage to get the mouse outside ( I think it was kind of still alive but hurt); however they then proceed to kill it outside. It was pretty horrifying. I think they could have really handled it in a different way so customers didn't see the whole fiasco. \n\nAt this point one of the guys comes over and says sorry but wants us to delete any recordings we have of the mouse. I'm pretty sure he only said sorry cuz he thought that would get us to delete the picture we had. Strange.....I would have just apologized and comped the meal. They gave us 10% off the bill which really didn't compensate for what just transpired. \n\nWe were pretty grossed out leaving the place and I just felt like it was REALLY TRAUMATIZING. We didn't need to see that kind of brutality...flame thrower really....\n\nMouse incident aside...the food isn't that great either especially for the prices."

The salt froth tea was really interesting and a nice mix of sweet and salty, and the melon green tea reminded me of melon ice cream that we used to get in Japan (but less sweet.) We also got the sushi/sashimi platter for one. The platter came well presented, and the fish was, for the most part, fresh and yummy.

They were mushy and very weird tasting. We got the Marilyn Monroe roll and I think it was called the Monster Roll? We each took one piece from each roll and called it quits. When we reported this to the manager and asked her to take it off our bill, her reply was, \"No, it's not our fault you didn't like your rolls. There was nothing wrong with them.\" .... Obviously there's something wrong with your rolls if it tastes disgusting. She was rude and not at all accommodating.

Atmosphere is nice with some quieter edm. Service is good. The reason I came in is I wanted to try something different, so I ordered the salmon rice burger, the mango drink, the spicy edamame and the grilled salmon head. \n\nSalmon burger is very interesting. I actually asked them how people eat it. Well some people eat it by cutting it into quarters but I just grabbed and devoured. The texture is GREAT. Very nice fit among rice, the crispy thingy and the salmon. The salmon is neither like sashimi nor grilled. It's more like the ground salmon you get in a sushi roll. Avocado is always good too. Try not to squish too hard on the burger as the content is very soft and can fall out easily.\n\nMango drink was good too. It was HUGE. I drink cold beverages very slowly so I ordered the other dishes. Spicy edamame was definitely interesting. It was spicy with some garlic slices. Indeed a very strong smell as told by the server. I loved it. Would be a nice complement to a special sushi roll.\n\nBbq salmon head, you can't just find it on the menu of every Japanese restaurant. The great thing about salmon head is the tenderness of the meat by the fish bone. A little overcooked to my taste, but it does then provide a good spectrum of meat tenderness. Skin is a bit too hard to chew. I did not agree with their selection of the dipping sauce. It was too sour for such a tender and slightly sweet meat. The lemon slice on the side was enough for me.\n\nOverall, GREAT food, helpful server, great location. I went in on Saturday afternoon around 6, not too crowded and immediately got a seat. The Taiwanese appetizers on the menu look great too. Would come back. Would recommend."

When you walk in, they have a more rowdier section with bar-top tables and for those who want a little more intimacy, they have booths in the back. \n\nWas originally seated in the front (rowdier) portion of the place, but was moved to a booth once it opened up. \n\nOrdered the sushi burger, California roll, Spicy Tuna roll, Spicy Kani roll, Takoyaki, Red Curry Shrimp with rice,very mango drink, and the Bubblefish Oolong Milk Tea. \n\nThe sushi burger was beautiful. Super difficult to eat as a whole, but if taken apart, the experience isn't as delicious. \n\nTakoyaki and the sushi rolls are all up to par and very reasonable. Nothing outstanding, but wasn't bad. \n\nAt first I was taken a back by the very different and distinct flavor it was, but eventually grew to love it! A little closer to the saltier side, but overall very flavorful. \n\nDrinks: If you do order the very mango drink, SHARE! It's huge. I made the mistake of ordering this for myself and there was no way I could finish it. However, the waitress was nice enough to offer a to-go option for the drink, which most places don't actually do."

Very unique and one of a kind sushi place with excellent services and AWESOME menu none found elsewhere in Philly and NJ! Sofia had \"Green Peace\" which is a signature roll consisting of sweet potato tempura, asparagus, cucumber, mango, topped with sliced avocado and mango puree. I had \"Tuna Princess\"\nwhich consist of spicy tuna, avocado, topped with torched peppered tuna, honey wasabi and spicy mayo sauce. For drinks?

So thanks!!  \nWe got the sushi and sashimi platter for 2, yellow tail scallion roll, spicy crunchy tuna (this is not listed but I would assume is a pretty common roll - they actually had no idea what it was and I had to explain to them), and the tuna tacos.\nSince we got take out the tuna tacos came deconstructed - there were three of them.  They were good - it was a mix of iceberg lettuce with masago, tuna and a spicy sauce .  I've had better elsewhere but this was still good. \nThe sushi rolls and sashimi were decent and satisfying.  Everything tasted good There was one particular fish that was not good at all - I think it was the mackerel, they seared the sides - I don't know if that's what made these pieces unbearable chewy but I really did not like this at all.  Everything else was good.  We will stop in again to try their other menu items."

        "text": "Our go-to sushi restaurant had been Bleu Sushi, but we were intrigued by the rotating light sign of the cute bubble fish out front that shines on the sidewalk.  Fast forward 2 weeks, and finally we got to try their sushi and bubble tea on a late Sunday night!\n\nI was expecting it to be very busy, but we were able to be seated right away.  There is a variety of seating, with tables in the front by the window, to smaller booths, and a lounge area with a big red couch in the middle by the sushi bar and drink station.  We were seated in the very back with round booths, which were very cozy.  I like how it's not too crowded with tables and I felt like it was a deliberate choice to preserve the ambience, with lovely lighting with clear bulbs around the lamps and the dark, cozy feel.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Tuna avocado roll ($5, 8 pieces) - amazing, no fishy taste at all, and the ratio of fish to rice with so high!  Tender and flavorful.  The ratio of fish to avocado was also perfect.\n\n2. Yellowtail roll with jalepeno ($5, 6 pieces) - this was also amazing, with a buttery yellowtail taste that was also not fishy at all.  The jalepeno added a tiny bit of kick and was not overpowering at all.  \n\n3. Bubblefish roll ($10.95, 8 or 10 pieces) - THE BEST THING WE ORDERED.  Spicy crab roll with mango, wrapped with seared salmon and miso glaze.  I could have eaten two of these rolls.  Perfect balance of flavors, tons of crab filling and my favorite part was the seared salmon part on top.  The miso glaze was slightly sweet and added a great finishing touch.  Fresh mango that wasn't too sour provided texture and balance.\n\n4. Taiwanese beef noodle soup - this took awhile to come out.  Large slabs of marbled beef with a clean and mild soup taste.  The noodles were al dente and nicely flavored.  The tea egg was a bit overdone.  Overall not bad, but not a standout either.\n\nDrinks:\n\n5.  Peach green tea ($4.25 without bubbles) - very nice and strong tea taste.  Came in a beer stein.\n\n6.  Bubblefish milk green tea ($4.75 with bubbles) - again, no artificial powdery taste here!  Funny that all the milk drinks were made with lactaid, but I wouldn't have known that unless I read the menu.  Bubbles were soft and chewy, and it came in a cute glass.\n\nOverall, the sushi and drinks make this a standout place to treat yourself after a long and busy work week.  Perfect for hanging out at night with friends or with a significant other.  I want to come back and try the lunch special - 2 rolls for $7.95 (the normal rolls, not the special ones).  I also want to try some of the other things on the menu - the Tuna Avocado and dons will be my next targets!  So excited to come back!"

The atmosphere was super hip and trendy, as I loved the design of the place. Would have stayed if I had time though, as I was visiting from Virginia just for the day. For drinks, I ordered the avocado smoothie as they are my favorite. It was mediocre compared to what I've had before, and tasted like they used too much ice. My boyfriend got the rice water bubble tea, or something along those lines, because it sounded very unique - and that it was! Personally, I didn't enjoy the drink and didn't expect to be drinking actual pieces of rice. For the third drink, we had a regular milk tea with bubbles, which of course was good because you can't go wrong with that. And the fourth drink was a guava green tea, which I loved and was surprised that it wasn't as sweet as I expected. I definitely recommend this place for their bubble tea, as they have many unique options! Just be cautious of ordering any smoothies or else expect an icee!"

Maybe I'm biased because Yakitori serves shrimp tempura by itself without vegetables for the same price this place serves it with vegetables and you only get 2 shrimp. The additional vegetables were sweet potato, broccoli, mushroom and asparagus. Also under the description it'll tell you if it's shrimp and vegetables however this didn't have that so I was under the impression that it was solely shrimp. Also I must note that the usual sauce that's served with shrimp tempura was not given, I was given soy sauce. \n\nThe sushi wasn't bad as all, didn't seem as fresh as I am use to but it wasn't bad. I had the Marilynroll. \n\nThe interior decor was modern and grand. I wouldn't have minded eating there (btw I did Take Out).\n\nI wouldn't mind going back to check out other sushi dishes however, I would not order tempura again."

I had the sea eel Don and it was really delicious. If you're new to eel, I recommend trying it. I'm sure you won't regret it because it's packed with flavor. I also loved how they give you enough rice to go with the eel and each bite with the rice was the same amount of flavor you got with the last bite. They made sure of it by spreading out the eel and the rice so that each bite you take is going to be delicious.\n\nI can't wait to come back!\nI'll surely be a returning customer!"

The restaurant is expansive, so there are always tables available. The wait staff were very friendly and recognized me the second day I arrived.\n\nOn the first day, I ordered the fresh oysters since they just arrived. Unfortunately when I ordered it, I realized that they would be raw instead of fried. I enjoyed a few of them. I'm not a huge fan of hot sauce and there were a few oysters with hot sauce pre-applied. However, they were definitely fresh and presented beautifully. I ordered the chirashi, which I usually get at other Japanese restaurants. The slices are quite thick and I didn't think there was enough rice. There was one protein that I didn't like, and didn't realize what it was until the next day, which was the conch. The conch has hot sauce pre-applied and is also tough compared to fish. I also ordered the very mango drink. The mug that it comes in is quite tall, so you get a lot of drink for the price. It was very tasty. At the bottom are balls of liquid, similar to salmon roe. It was quite unique and was fun at first, but then it became a chore to consume.\n\nOn the second day, I started with the takoyaki. Yum! I've never had it before, but heard wonderful things. It was definitely a treat. The outside is a soft fried batter, while the inside is soft and contained discernible pieces of octopus tentacles. I ordered the sashimi heaven. Unfortunately it was just a larger version of the chirashi I ordered the previous day, except that the rice was on the side and there were more slices of the same set of fish and conch. This time the wait staff named the contents of the dish, so I was aware that there was conch. This time I removed the hot sauce and it wasn't as bad. Though the slices of fish were just as thick. The presentation was definitely pretty. I ended the evening with a matcha green tea crepe cake. It was delicious! It was like eating layers of green tea-flavored phyllo dough."

With that said, I really, REALLY appreciate that you can choose just how much sugar you want in each of your drinks here - Less 70%; 50% or even 0... YES!  Most of the smoothies are already so sweet so you can totally cut it down in half and not even miss out on it too much.  I highly recommend the Matcha milkshake.... omg this was amazing.  Perfectly blended; not too sweet AT ALL.  Refreshing and just SO GOOD.

I think it's really great that Chinatown is seeing a lot more foot traffic and getting much more attention as its own neighborhood. Even better, according to my friend who recommended it, Bubblefish is locally owned!\n\nNow onto our visit. Said friend and I came to Bubblefish for a Sunday lunch. Things weren't too busy, so we were able to get seated quickly. Service, overall, was prompt and attentive. Bubblefish's interior design is aesthetically pleasing, with dark woods and interesting light fixtures certainly keeping it within trend.\n\nFood-wise, we started off with the Taiwanese salt-baked chicken as an appetizer. It was a generous portion for my friend and me to share, and it was crunchy, salty deliciousness. For our entr\u00e9es, I opted for two rolls, the Chicken Tempura and Spicy Salmon. They were of good size for the price and though I am admittedly not the most discerning of sushi eaters, I thought they tasted fresh and flavorful. My friend ordered the Tonkatsu rice bowl, which she thought was a bit dry but I thought tasted just fine.\n\nTo wash down my meal, I had a big (it was huge!!) cup of warm milk tea. My friend ordered one of the speciality cold drinks. For me, I think an area of improvement would be with the drink options. Though I enjoyed my tea, it was definitely on the sweeter side, and, if I had the opportunity, I definitely would have ordered a smaller size. Right now, I believe that all drinks come in one portion size. But if I were to return, I definitely would want to try another drink on their very extensive menu.\n\nOverall, it was a great meal and I was left plenty stuffed by the end. It's a great little spot for lunch or even if you just want to grab a drink with friends."

First impression, oh this is a nice contemporary decor place with I guess electro pop music annoyingly louder than white noise. Our first time here and we decided to try a few things. We ordered a lamb skewer and a beef skewer to share; the beef was a big overly salted and had big chunks of chewy fat, the lamb was a bit better but still unappetizing fat chunks. I ordered for my entree the tuna poke bowl and my bf ordered the sushi burger and we split a bubblefish roll. I really enjoyed the presentation of everything and the lemony tang of my poke. But that was it. The bubblefish roll was ok, a bit overly sweet w the sauces over it and the pickled ginger was a bit off; maybe it was from a jar or old I dunno it just didn't cut it. My bf sushi burger was ok we liked how there was crisp lettuce to contrast in all the soft textures. Service: we were greeted and seated promptly. But table service was a bit slow. This place was ok, probably won't be returning since there is so much more out there."

Overall, I was happy with my pretty expensive take-out lunch.\n\nThe chicken was delicately crispy even after a walk back to work.  It was nice and light and had a pleasant aftertaste with the different spices used to make the batter.  For $5.95, you get a decent sized portion.\n\nThe Angry Dragon roll consisting of Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Tuna, Mango, Spicy Crab, and Yuzu Miso Sauce was very good.  The pieces were large and flavorful.  Very good sushi for about $12.\n\nWhat I hated and did not finish was my Three Musketeers Bubble Tea.  The bubbles of Jam, Grass, and Fig were just fine, but the tea itself I felt like I was drinking crushed flowers with a shot of perfume.  This was just bad for me and a waste of about $6.\n\nBubblefish was great to try out and I'd recommend for a nice lunch.  I'll probably avoid the teas next time or try something less fancy.\n\nService was nice and friendly.  They directed me to a table to wait for my meal to go.\n \n$25 for take-out lunch.  A little high, but the sushi and chicken were very good and worth it!"

Their bubble tea comes hot and cold. I recommend foam tea if you're looking for something different, it adds a layer of saltiness to your drink, like eating caramel sea salt ice cream, very interesting. As far as food goes, you should try all their dishes. While most of the food here is available elsewhere, Bubble fish serve them with a style. I can't pin point wether it's their presentation or just an added ingredient but their food feels young and hip. The sushi are also recommended. I don't usually do sushi at a tea and dessert place but this place won me over. The servers are sweet and friendly, making you feel very comfortable here. Come with a friend or family, you will enjoy your time regardless. If there is any complaints, it would be sometimes the food takes a bit to come out, even on a slow day. Don't let this deter you from checking the restaurant out though, you will regret it!"

And their menu is super cute. \n\nThe drinks come without ice so they won't be diluted. Some may think the drinks are a bit more expensive compare to other tea places but the big portion makes up for that. So I think they are totally worth it.\n\nThe food was on point. I liked everything I ordered. The tofu cream cheese was very delicious as it wasn't too sweet. Volcano chicken was very good as well.

It literally took 40 minutes to get ANY of our food. No appetizers or anything. Then when we finally did get our takoyaki, we only got 2 out of the 3 takoyakis we ordered. The waitress got us another takoyaki, and a different waitress gave us our platter of signature rolls which was missing one of the rolls. We decided to cancel that roll. The sushi was terrible, it would fall apart easily, fish wasn't fresh, and the rice was old. My friend said the red curry shrimp was okay, I would usually add another star for that, but the customer service just knocked it down one. When we told the waitress that the sushi we had wasn't good and if it could be remade she said she would talk to the manager. She came back and told us the manager was sorry and that she would give us a dessert on the house. Uhhhh no? We are paying this much for sushi and you try to compensate us with a dessert? We decided not to get the dessert and just get the check since we were done with that place. They ended up bringing a grass jelly dessert for us anyway which tasted diluted. I have made grass jelly dessert at home. It's not hard, but they even botched that up. The manager never came to the table to apologize, and all she gave us was a watery dessert. I used to love this place but I am NEVER coming back again. Worst experience I ever had at a restaurant, and I'm pretty darn patient......"

        "text": "Short review: Wonderful place to dine at. You can go in and take to go or eat in. I went with a group that started with five, but ended with twelve. As a result, we kept having food added to our order, but Bubblefish was very accommodating. Their food and drinks are heavenly tasting, especially their tea drinks. It has the taste of real fine fresh tea that no other place in Chinatown has as far as I'm concerned. Pretty nice interior, though it's not a lounge like place like KFT, it's more restaurant like. A bit pricey, especially if you're going with a large group, but the food is worth the price.\n\nDecor:\nHigh ceilings, dim lighting mainly, but there is light from the window during the day. There is a room for rather large parties (or reservations perhaps?) in the back that is lighted up brightly. Although the seating area lighting is dim, it gives off a nice atmosphere. The decorations are unique and nice. The tables aren't too stuffed together or cramped up.\n\nService:\nWonderful service, especially considering he fact that my group would have people come in either solo or in a small group that ended in twelve people dining. The waitresses didn't have any problems when we continued to add food to our order at random times, and they were very courteous and polite. The owner, Xu, would chat with the customers too. The only minor issue would be that our food and drinks didn't come all at once, but I'd consider that understandable seeing as we ordered over ten drinks alone and god knows how much food. Even so, we got our food in a reasonable amount of time. Props to Bubblefish for that.\n\nFood: \nThe food oh my god. Tasted wonderful to me. The sushi was reallllly good. Onigiris seemed pretty packed, takoyakis definitely felt bigger than the ones at KFT or TeaDo. The unagi don looked wonderful and tasted wonderful. The drinks are beautiful. If you dine it they serve them in such a fancy way. I recommend the Taiwanese Salt Baked Chicken, very tasty and yummy and their tea drinks. \n\nDrinks: \nTheir tea drinks are without a doubt 500%. Places like KFT or TeaDo or Mr Wish in Chinatown never have tea tasting like this. The taste of tea can clearly be tasted, no matter what the flavor your drink is; my friend said its the taste of fresh tea. If you're looking for good tea drinks, definitely try Bubblefish's. You won't find any other place in Chinatown that'll serve tea drinks like them. I tried the taro milk tea, and it was wonderful. And they serve all their drinks in such fancy glassware. Water in little mason jars, milkshakes in root beer mugs, and milk tea in those glass milk bottle like glasses. Some of the teas are actually served in clear glass teapots and cups, which I didn't try. \n\nPricing:\nIt is pretty pricy, considering the other stores that are in the Chinatown area. But it is pretty reasonable in my opinion. Pricey but worth it is what I'd say. After all, quality is better than quantity no? The drinks my group ordered were all around $5, especially since dine in drinks are all served large size. The onigiri was about $3 if I remember correctly. You can get some of the sushis 2 for $7 or $8, and they have sushi platters for around $13. Dons (rice with eel or pork cutlet or seafood?) are about $12. \n\nOverall, if you're in the Center City Philadephia area, make a stop in Chinatown for Bubblefish. If not for the food then for their drinks. Bubblefish can definitely expect me to frequent their place a bit often, especially for their wonderful teas."

When I walked in, it was a good looking place, It felt comfortable, had a healthy environment, and overall just a nice restaurant. The chairs were comfortable, at first I thought it was gonna be leather plastic chairs but it was quite nice. The waters was in a jar which I found had a good look to the restaurant. The customer service was great here, they took good care of us, made sure we left out satisfied. Then the food arrived. For our apps we had beef on a stick and six seasoned chickens which was amazing. I thought the beef look tough but it was quite tender and not chewy. The chicken was fresh, tender, and juicy. It came with ranch dressing? And sweet and sour sauce which went great with the chicken. For our finale, we had sushi. The sushi was great compared to other philadelphia sushi restaurants. It was fresh, had big pieces, the rice had a nice texture to it, not to hard not to soft. We had the out of control roll, angry dragon roll, Marilyn roll, and spicy crab roll. The rolls was great but found that the spicy crab roll was a little too salty to my taste but it was okay. I love this restaurant. I would come back any day to try their other selections of food that they offer. Overall rating I give it a 4/5."

We were shocked at how beautifully minimalist, spacious, and yet extremely cozy it is inside! Not to mention, the portions are worth the money in my opinion. My fianc\u00e9e and I were so excited at the lengthy tea menu they provided, we actually had two different teas each.\n\nWe started off with two bubble milk teas, iced and hot. They were served in two large mugs (the size is always large if dining in) and we learned/admired their healthier alternative to normal sugar - black cane sugar - and lactaid milk to suit everyone's needs. The best part? You wouldn't know the difference in taste if you didn't know.\n\nAs for our entrees, we ordered Unagi Don (eel rice bowl) and TGI Fresh Roll (sushi containing salmon, spicy kani, yellowtail, spicy tuna, and avocado). I kept eating my fianc\u00e9e's Unagi Don that I almost ordered one to go (first time trying eel and loved it -- definitely recommend)! My sushi was pretty delicious as well. We continued with waffles with green tea ice cream and fruit as our dessert. Not bad, but probably won't order it again. Finished up with two more warm teas (oolong bubble milk tea and ginger bubble milk tea) to go and stayed a while to let the cool vibe and chill music sink in.\n\nWe will be returning to try more of their delicious tea and fish options!!\n\nEdit: We stopped by a few more times after our first visit and tried the Live Uni and Saury Fish - to die for!

The inside and decor was quite nice and very tranquil. The service was great and real fast and friendly. My wife and I got a few appetizers and some cooked maki rolls. We ordered smoked salmon onigari, taco yaki, baked Taiwanese chicken, and tea. Everything was pretty good and service was fast! I would definitely come here again and the price to portion size ratio was great! I give this place another try for the food, atmosphere, and service was all pretty good."

My friend had coconut pineapple green tea. He liked it very much.\n\nThe food was very good, probably one of the best sushi I ever tried. I love their veil ribs, you can taste the sweetness of the meat. Their rolls were also really decent, I love their tuna princess roll! Definitely recommend it.\n\nThey also have a study/ meeting room that you can definitely use to study!!!! Sadly, I'm not in Philadelphia everyday, but will definitely come back for more when I'm in town."

Words cannot begin to describe the food, drinks, and service that comes from a Bubblefish experience. There are times where friends and I would just hang out in Bubblefish for hours enjoying their teas, snacking on their apps or desserts, and working on our laptops for school/work in the back room. There's never a feeling of being rushed by the wait staff. My go-to items are (1) Guava Oolong Tea or Guava Banana Milk Shake, (2) Tuna Princess Roll or T.G.I.Fresh Roll, and (3) the Salmon or Tuna Poke. \n\nPros:\n-- For the price you are paying, you are getting some really fresh and delicious raw seafood that is not offered anywhere else for that price\n-- You do not feel rushed at all if you just want to sit and relax\n-- There is a \"secret menu\" of sorts -- there are dishes the kitchen/chef can whip up that isn't on the regular or specials menu. I recommend asking what seafood they have that isn't on the regular menu if you want to venture.\n-- Their Signature Rolls are the bomb... and so is the Poke... and so are the Sashimi Platters (do yourself a favor and try one if you can stomach raw seafood)\n-- They have Uni (Sea Urchin)\n-- Edison (the Head Chef) is the reason why I keep coming back -- every dish he makes is made with TLC (Tender Loving Care)\n\nCons:\n-- The wait is definitely a bit long, but I believe it is well worth it when you're seeking fresh seafood, raw or cooked\n\nOverall, Bubblefish has become my go-to spot for when I am craving seafood/sushi. Since it opened, I don't think I have gone anywhere else and I really don't feel the desire to for that matter. \n\nP.S. If anyone wants a more detailed description of the dishes, check out Ricky C.'s review!"

And inexpensive.\nWe then ordered sushi (delicious, inexpensive) two bento-stlye boxes (huge and inexpensive) and the sushi \"burger\" (sushi  rice bun, nori, spicy tuna, avocado, fried onions, and more). We couldn't get over how good everything was for such a reasonable price. \nMy husband mentioned to the server that we were there for my daughter's birthday, and after the meal, they brought out a tray of fried bananas with whipped cream and a candle.

Our server had a lovely personality and recommended dishes for us. \nFood: Very unique twist on a traditional sushi roll. \n\nNegatives:\nSlow. We ordered three rolls and it took 30 minutes to get them. The restaurant wasn't that crowded so am assuming they are doing an amazing take-out business\nCold. We were seated closer to the door. As people came and went, the temperature became much colder.\nTea. I am a temperature snob on my hot beverages. The way they served the tea, it was over a candle so it remained consistently scalding. There was no way to drink the tea unless you let it sit for 3-4 minutes.

Because this was a competition format with chefs from other restaurants, we didn't get the full experience of dining from their regular menu, but Edison won all four rounds. \n\nHe made several items off of their regular menu, and they provided some additional appetizers, and all of them were very good.

My friends ordered mango shaved ice, some jelly glass dessert and ginger tea. I went for takoyaki and the smoked salmon onigiri. The desserts and tea came out pretty quick but my food took forever. \n\nThe takoyaki came out first - I was really looking forward to it! It came in two small skewers of three pieces each. I was a bit disappointed as it tasted pretty doughy. There wasn't much octopus there. Don't get e wrong, it was good but way too much dough and not enough meat. Ten or fifteen minutes later, the onigiri came out. I liked the sauce that it came with but it was not smoked salmon. It was more like steamed salmon. The jelly dessert was pretty good but I didn't really like the mango shaved ice.  \n\nWhen the bill came, the waitress told me that had a minimum of $15 for credit card.

The first thing I remember when walking into the place was ooh look a panda!. Really modern and creative ambiance was given off by the lighting, tables, chairs, and the tableware. They had a lot of drinks on their menu, which is awesome if you're feeling a milk tea or a oolong black tea. Many different options so you can quench your thirst. We ordered three rolls, the shrimp tempura, salmon godzilla, and the angry dragon. The angry godzilla combined all your favorite ingredients into one big, lovely roll. Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, mango, topped with spicy crab and yuzu miso sauce. I really loved the sauce. The sauce was fruity and earthy and savory and brought in all the ingredients together. OF course the shrimp tempura was bomb too, it had that nice crunch from the cucumber. The salmon godzilla had spicy salmon, avocado, sasago, and crunch. They have crunch listed on the ingredients and I don't know what that is but I'm dying to find out, something about salmon and crunch gives your mouth more textures which is always a fun time. I'm looking forward to coming back here to try their other options on the menu when I do come back to Philly."

The staff kept refilling it which was very nice! \n\nThe uni sashimi was a little disappointing, besides the fact that it was very small in portion, the pairing was also a little strange because it was served over a piece of cucumber and small piece of mint. Uni, naturally doesn't have a lot of flavor, so the mint overpowered it all and pairing it with cucumber just didn't taste right to me. \nThe sashimi heaven was very good though, they served salmon belly as one of the raw fishes! I've never had it before and this definitely left an impression, I will definitely come back for more, all the other types of fish were pretty fresh. \nThe bubble fish roll and tuna princess roll were also very good, both with very flavorful. For any one they like specialty/ chef rolls these are a must try. \nMy boyfriend loved the salt baked chicken, he said that it reminded him of popcorn chicken, there's a specific spice in the chicken that I personally wasn't a fan of but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. But I have to say the texture of the chicken is very interesting, even though its called baked chicken, it is crispy like fried chicken but does have the oiliness of fried chicken.\n\nOverall even though the uni was an disappointment, the restaurant still serves quality sushi& sashimi, definitely with a try!\n\nThey take card but also have an ATM machine right by the door"

The seaweed was a bit too chewy and the sushi rice was lukewarm (for the tuna which was wrapped on the outside). The eel avocado roll was good, but eel is also pretty simple since it's generally pre-packaged and you just microwave it. \n\nThe chirashizushi was also a bit disappointing. There was one piece of sashimi that I didn't recognize that was really great (the square white fish on the bottom left), but the rest could have been better (fresher).\n\nHOWEVER I know that my standards for sushi are maybe unfairly high, so keep that in mind too. I honestly wouldn't mind going back at all, I think it's all pretty good, and the wait staff is excellent, I just won't be putting it as my number one spot for sushi in the city.\n\nALSO they're in their soft opening so didn't have shaved ice BUT they apparently will soon and then I'll probably want to go all the time."

I also ordered the lunch special - pick two sushi/maki rolls for $7.95. The spicy salmon was Delish! The shrimp tempura, on the other hand, was weak; it kept falling apart, it wasn't rolled tight enough. The actual shrimp was pretty tasty though. \n\nI also ordered a medium lychee green tea with tapioca, which cost $3.25 plus an extra $.50 for the tapioca- again, I'll compare the drink to TeaDo, which offers free tapioca with all of their drinks. At TeaDo, I could order a large green tea with tapioca and for instance, mango jelly for $4.50. That's a drink plus two toppings!\n\nIn any case, despite my disappointing lunch today, I'll go back but only to try their sushi and maybe, desserts (only because I have a sweet tooth)\n\nOk...came back so I updated my review to an extra star. I had their tuna and avocado sushi, which was Delish! I'll come back!"

Their bubble teas are very tea-based, as in you can taste the actual tea and know that it's not powder.

I didn't really taste the lychee or fig jelly. The tapioca balls, or bubbles, were not too soft and chewy. \n\nOnly downside was the $15 minimum for credit cards.

The ambience of the restaurant is very nice and modern, although I do question some of their music choices as I was there. Nevertheless, it never bothered me. The restaurant is modern in design with a touch of spirit of Chinatown with a fish tank, and a dragon's head decoration. It was nice to see a modern spin.\n\nThe price point of this place and it's quality is what makes it worth it. You usually get what you pay for. My party of 4 and I first ordered Tropical Fruits Tea. All the brewed teas there are free refills! Like most fruit infused teas, it was very light with the fruity flavor but it was very nice. For this particular tea, we were also given syrup to sweeten the tea if needed. I went a little food crazy and ordered a Bubblefish green milk tea with an Angry Dragon Roll, an Unagi Don, and Cheesecake. \n\nThe milk teas here are standard in fare about $4.50 for a large, but they are worth it because of the size you get in you dine-in. They give it to you in this cool pitcher! For me the food came out pretty quickly as it wasn't too busy. When I read the description of the Angry Dragon Roll I thought it was going to be way too complex in flavor due to it's many ingredients, but I was so wrong. The flavor was perfect and everything complimented each other so nicely. My friend put it as \"It took him on a journey\"! The Unagi Don which costed around $12 dollars comes in this big round dish, but it was shallow. The Unagi quality was great but they didn't provide much Unagi. They did provide other sides like kani, egg custard, and cucumbers though. The cheesecake, creme brulee, and waffle desserts were nothing too special, but it was still very satisfying.\n\nThe waitress Trang was very helpful in describing everything for us as it was some of our first times.

I have gotten their Very Mango Drink and Hot Red Bean Milk Tea, and though it is definitely a bit pricier than the tea shops in Chinatown, Bubblefish does not skimp on their drink portions. For their entrees, I have tried their Chirashi, Eel Don, and Poke Bowl. They are very generous with their fish portions in the chirashi, and coupling that with one of their large drinks ensures I never leave hungry. On the other hand, the  poke bowl was a unique experience, with a bright mix of bright colors, crunchy textures and lemon-y flavors mixed in with the fish and rice. Though the size of the dish was smaller than I would have liked, I felt satisfied with the taste of the meal all the same.

Topped with white tuna and a smokey tasting sauce, this roll is quite delicious\n\n- spider roll - you can't go wrong with soft shell crab. \n\n- Taiwanese beef noodle soup - the broth is warm and comforting. With round slices of beef, an egg and a helping a spinach and preserved veggies, it definitely hits the spot. \n\nI've also tried the onigiri - I didn't think much of it, although my husband is a fan. They look like standing sushi triangles stuffed with rice an the meat of your choice. He likes the salmon and shrimp onigiri. Both are savory, with the shrimp just a tad on the sweeter side. \n\nThe staff are always friendly and greet you when you enter.

They were really friendly and actually cared enough to ask if there's something wrong with the drink when they saw that my passion fruit was still full. Pricing was not bad. I think i will be coming back here often!"

The salmon belly is to die for with the fatty taste and just enough saltiness on it that it's not overbearing. For 2 big eaters, we got the sushi for 3 as sushi for 2 will leave you wanting more. The sashimi is extremely fresh and quality is phenomenal. The 2 rolls that came with our meal were also made with flavors that pack a punch. And the sweetest part of all is that the price point is on the sweet side and it's not too expensive to rip your wallet empty and for the quality, man it's definitely worth it. Cream on top, they have a great selection of bubble tea to accompany the great food."

We were seated by the window which was a little chilly since it was only about 20 degrees outside that night. But that didn't really bother us much. \n\nWe ordered bubble tea drinks to begin with and the waitress we had was really nice and helpful. She gave us recommendations since it was our first time. I got the Red bean hot tea which was delicious. My sister got the Peach bubble tea and my friend got the Three Musketeers, which is a tea consisting of 3 different jellies. \n\nWe ordered Fried Calamari as our app, which had a great subtle flavor. We each also ordered our own plates of sushi and onigiri. We got the eel avocado, crab roll, tuna princess and they were out of salmon skin that night. Other alternatives were also great. I would definitely recommend this place and I'm definitely going back soon!"

The wait time for the sushi was long but that was to be expected since it's sushi. The food was okay I would give it a 3 out of 5. Then when we finished our meals, we struggled to grab the attention of the waiter again. Overall, the food was alright, but the service was a 2 out of 5. Personally, the restaurant can improve significantly if there waiters had better awareness, but in there defense when I asked for a sauce they were able to deliver it quickly. \n\nTl;dr okay food but the service was weak. \n2/5 - service\n3/5 - food"

The sushi was not amazing but it was not bad, the Avacado was great though! I also ordered a drink called Green Tea with Lychee, that was the highlight of my meal. If you ever go to Bubblefish, a must try is their drinks! My friends got the Coffee and Mango drink and it was amazing as well! The waiter came back and forth asking if everything was fine which was good! But collected my friend's plates when I wasn't even finished yet which made me rush a little. The layout is very nice and calm. When I look at the staff area, there was no sort of smile or communication. When I go in a restaurant, I like to see staff talking to each other, smiling, and enjoying what they do. Rather than that, I would recommend this place to other people!\n\nSECOND TIME:\nThe waiter did not give waiter out right away. She came to take our order and we had to ask for water.\nThe waiter came and gave us the wrong order at first and gave us a Salmon Poke Bowl when I ordered a Tuna and Salmon roll. \nI got my Tuna Avocado roll and the avocado looks squished. They forgot my spicy mayo in which I had to ask for. The seaweed was really hard on the salmon roll. \nThe spicy mayo was not spicy, it was more sweet. The Tuna avocado, one of it has no avocado on it just Tuna. \n\nMy friends both got El and they both tasted multiple bones in it. One of my friend said \"it made me choke\". \n\nThey gave us our tips and we payed and the waiters were talking to each other and one was on their phone and we were waiting for our change. The waiter walked over at one point and then walked back to waiter desk. \n\nWe asked for change when we paid. The waiter took the money and went to cashier and did not give back our change until a couple minutes later. \n\nMy friends and me were really frustrated. \n\nThis place was not worth it this time I came. Contemplating if I should come back and write an updated 3rd review."

I'm big on food looking appetizing and photo worthy when it's brought to the table. We liked the modern sleek decor of the restaurant, nice staff very attentive, fresh food, fast service and the ability to enjoy as a date night or gathering with friends spot.

Long story short, food is amazing but the wait is quite atrocious.\n\nWhen we entered the restaurant, there were only three tables average around 3 persons at each table. With this in mind, we thought that food would come quick...boy, were we wrong! \n\nI ordered an item from the specials which is basically sashimi, bonito flakes, and fried onions topped on a bed of white rice. My coworker ordered chirashi. \n\nAbout 20 minutes into the wait, we investigated what was going on and found out from the waitress that the chefs had to prepare for a large party. Had we been informed about this, we may have picked a different place.\n\nFor two entr\u00e9es,  it took a whooping 45 minutes to arrive and that is unacceptable. Customers should at least be informed that the wait will be longer due to special circumstances.\n\nNow that we talked about the wait, lets get to the food and really the only reason why I gave this place three stars rather than one.\n\nThe food deserves praises and the arrangement is truly Instagram worthy. The salmon is creamy and buttery, the sirarcha sauce tip toes the delicate balance between creamy eggy-ness and savory spiciness, the fried onion and the avocado creates a wonderful contrast between cholesterol clogging goodness and heart healthy nuttiness.\n\nI thought the fried onion balances out the overall creamy texture of the dish and gave it bit of a \"bite\".\n\nOverall, if you have the time and aren't starving for good food, this is the place for you! If you're starving or don't have much time, try somewhere else!"

They have really big portions for a good price and for a sushi place. I just really don't like how they cut and mix up their fish into a paste.

My husband's favorite is the white tuna (even though white tuna is not white tuna and is actually the cheapest thing ever...)\nTakoyaki: aka octopus balls. Quite the opposite of chirashi, they are very STINGY with the octopus (only about two 1cm tiny pieces in each ball) \nPoke bowl: is a regular order for me! Salmon or tuna option in a rice bowl\nDrinks: are high quality, but recommend ordering with less sugar because it is really sweet\n\nService is very nice, but slow.

It was bursting with flavor. The normal rolls, rainbow and spicy salmon were really good as well, better than other normal sushi restaurants I tried.

I also ordered the lunch special - pick two sushi/maki rolls for $7.95. The spicy salmon was Delish! The shrimp tempura, on the other hand, was weak; it kept falling apart, it wasn't rolled tight enough. The actual shrimp was pretty tasty though. \n\nI also ordered a medium lychee green tea with tapioca, which cost $3.25 plus an extra $.50 for the tapioca- again, I'll compare the drink to TeaDo, which offers free tapioca with all of their drinks. At TeaDo, I could order a large green tea with tapioca and for instance, mango jelly for $4.50.

The environment is great and the way they design it is just fabulous. Just walking into their store gave me a nice feeling. Unless other bubble tea place where the light is always dim or dark, theirs' bright and welcoming. I doesn't make me feel like I'm going to a club or a bar.\n\nOther than bubble tea, they also have sushi and other variety choices of food. The food there is great and fresh. I got the tuna princess sushi and my friend got the sushi heaven. The server recommend me a special that they had which I also end up getting. The food did take a while to be serve due to the large amount of customers there, but it was definitely worth every second of the wait. The server were also very friendly when greeting me and delivering our food to our table. I couldn't ask for more from them."

We ordered the Taiwanese Salt Baked Chicken for our appetizer, two sushi roll: Fuji Yama (one of their signature rolls) and eel avocado roll (always my favorite),\u00a0\u00a0 Tonkotsu Ramen, and the Roselle Chrysenthamum herbal tea. The salt baked chicken was well marinated with spice; every piece of chicken is very tendered and every bite gives me a mouthful of tasty flavor. The Fuji Yama Roll is topped with fried jumbo shrimp and fish egg. Oh I love the shrimp, it was so crispy. I love it. The sauce on the roll seemed to bring out the flavor of every ingredient in the roll. Definitely recommend this tasty signature. I love that the broth of the ramen was sweet (not sugar sweet) and not very strong. The chashu was tender, flavorful, and tasty. The herbal tea came with a stand, a teapot, and two little cute glass cups with a side of sugar. At first, the tea tasted bland, but the server said the flavor will slowly come out, which was true. The tea has a light sour taste and with sugar, it was refreshing! In addition to the delicious food, the server was very polite and nice. They checked on us several times to make sure that everything is okay. Overall, it was a great experience for me and my brother. He said it is a very comfortable place. Definitely recommend to others and definitely will come back again."

Overall, the food wasn't to my liking, but I can see why it might be a popular spot for its ambience and fusion style. The sushi is not authentic, but again, it's fusion style so others might enjoy. Also note that the salmon tacos actually don't have any salmon in them (unless they just forgot to put it in my order). The dish I thought was worthwhile was the salmon poke!

It serves both Japanese and Taiwanese food but I was eager to try a Taiwanese dish and it did not disappoint.  In fact I can highly recommend the Taiwanese salt-baked chicken (popcorn chicken as some call it).  It is indeed tasty and when accompanied by a Taiwanese tea drink, it makes for a nice light-to-medium meal which is all I needed before heading to the theatre. My tea btw was a kumquat lemon yogurt tea which was awesome.  But there are dozens of other tea varieties to try out as well.  I wouldn't call the service received as friendly but it was efficient.  Indeed the check came before the meal was completely finished which is not a cool thing to do as it represents a wait staff wanting to turn the table over in a popular restaurant. Still I can def recommend Bubblefish."

I really love their Very Mango drink that is a mango smoothie contain with yogurt popping bubbles and mango bits on top. That is definitely the drink I go for every time I'm there. Along with that the takoyaki and the origini are two great appetizers to try. The takoyaki contains 2-3 pieces of squid while most places only contain one. My favorite appetizer was the crab origini which basically contains crabmeat, spicy mayo, and tobiko. The reason why I love the origini is the rice. The rice use to make it taste like the sushi rice with rice vinegar instead of regular white rice. The reason why it lost a star was due to the Taiwanese minced pork rice that I order. The taste of it was not so great and I actually tried this dish twice once the first time they promote the dish and the other time two months later which is today and there was not much of an improvement."

The chicken was so soft and filling, and I definitely didn't expect a salad with as much flavor as that one had! The speed of a revive was pretty normal, and more importantly, we all left stuffed, so I'm counting the visit as a win! \n\nConcerning price, we ordered two more (cheaper) rolls on top of what you see in the pictures.

I had their sashimi heaven and boy was it a tasty treat. The salmon belly definitely stood out with it seared skin. The freshness of the salmon and the smokiness of the skin swirls in your mouth. \nBeyond the normal menu, the owner and head chef introduced me to live uni (sea urchin) with wasabi sauce. I had Uni before at Sagami and Morimoto, and the Uni at Bubblefish was definitely the freshest. \"Killed and served kind of fresh. How do I know? The head chef went and said: \"Let me kill the Uni for you right now. The Uni was served with a wasabi sauce that compliments the creamy taste of the Uni. This dish brought me to tears literally. It got to the point where the head chef said he couldn't watch anymore because my tears won't stop flowing.\n\nMore updates on their special menu (varies each day). \n     -Live abalone: the dish was plated with the exterior meat circling around the inner meat on the shell. Each piece of abalone was topped with black roe and pieces of gold leaf (optional). The experience of the texture was new. Starting from the outside the meat of the abalone was crunchy and as you move closer to the middle it gets softer and softer. You also have a choose of two different sauce, ponzu and wasabi. \n     -Sweet shrimp: the body of the shrimp was served sashimi style and the head of the shrimp was serve as a tempura. When you taste the shrimp's body, you can taste the natural sweet flavor of the shrimp. The head looks inedible but the shell was fried to the point where you can bite through it like a chip. \n     -Hamachi Kama: grilled neck of a yellowtail. The skin was very crisp and the meat was tender. Along with the natural fat of the fish, the texture and flavor blends in your mouth. The dipping sauce gives the fish a tangy taste so use accordingly to your taste. \n     -Sea Conch with black roe and spring greens: the sea conch was tender like scallops. The addition of the spring green gives a dish a bit of a crisp texture.\n     -Skewer: lamb, beef, and squid. The beef was a little heavily seasoned. All of the skewers were tender even the squid. \n      - Japanese green tea crepe cake: it is composed of layers of green tea crepes. It has a sweet and salty taste to it. Definitely a new sensation. Can't compare it to any other deserts."

She's nice and really attentive so it was great to see her there. The interior of the restaurant is what I would describe as hip and sleek, pretty comfortable and the look is trending in chinatown as a lot of places are remodeling. Anyway we ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, eel avocado onigiri, takoyaki and the avocado shrimp rolls. I wasn't disappointed in anything, though my fiance thought the broth in the soup could have been more seasoned. The takoyaki was both yummy and pretty. I love onigiri in general but Bubblefish's was probably the best I had, the fact they have it on the menu is awesome because not many places do, I wish i got more of it.

On the other hand, the taste and texture did not match the aroma. I expected the chicken to be crispy/crunchy but the outer skin/coating of flour was soft and the chicken wasn't seasoned enough. The aroma was this HIGH and the taste was only this high. \nDrinks- ginger milk tea was ginger slices in milk tea. I did not taste any ginger flavor but I also wasn't sure if I was suppose to crush the ginger myself. Also the tea was lukewarm.

The ambiance is pretty nice; we were impressed with the sleek decor. Their tea menu is quite impressive, and everything we got was good. Their sushi is also quite good, a needed addition to Chinatown. The TGI Fresh, Tuna Princess, Monster, and Yellowtail rolls were all super yummy. Their menu also includes some Taiwanese and Japanese appetizers (the Taiwanese popcorn chicken was dubbed quite authentic by the experts at the table). \n\nThe only real problem was the service. Our teas took over 10 mins to come out, and the food even longer (and oddly staggered). The waitress was a bit confused at certain questions. At a more established place, it might have been bad enough to bring it down to 3 stars, but everyone was really nice, and since it's their first night open, I'll give them a pass. I think they knew things were a little messy too, because they brought us a (quite amazing) creme brulee to thank us for our patience. \n\nOverall, a great new place in Chinatown, once they figure out the service."

This place has been open for quite awhile, but it wasn't until then (last year), that my boyfriend and I finally got to try it out. One of the places we happened to come across on a whim.\n\nBest whim ever. I couldn't think of a better place to satisfy my hunger and sushi cravings after my tiring commute from New York. The decor in this place is modern and comforting. They even serve their sushi on a wooden platter which even adds to the aesthetic more. \n\nThe sushi is fresh, and everything else that you would want from sushi. Not to mention the prices are very reasonable and they offer great deals for three rolls. They not only sell sushi, but they also sell other dishes as well such as rice, ramen, and almost any other Asian dish you could think of.\n\nThe drinks are delicious and largely portioned, some of them come in a huge glass which is more than enough for one person. \n\nThis place is now one of our go-to sushi spots and we will keep returning!"

My friend ordered the famous Very Mango and they were really stingy with the fresh cut mango toppings. Lastly, we ordered the cold grass jelly and the grass jelly was not smooth either, very clumpy. Went in with high hopes but came out not satisfied! Won't be a returning customer. Only reason why I give two stars instead of one is because at least the servers were friendly."

Unfortunately I can't frequent this place often as there is a $15 minimum for credit card when I went there."

They have a small fish tank in the restaurant with a very interesting looking giant headed kalamu fish. Staff are attentive and came by several times to make sure everything is going well. \nMoving on to the food. \n\n\"Bubble\"tea: a lot of variety, takes 2+ pages on the menu. However, they did not contain any tapioca. They did not offer the options for topping nor did they ask for the size, and straight up brought out the large for me and my gf. Would have been nice to be offered these options. We had trouble finish them, but that brings me to my next point: the portions are huge. We ordered the salmon poke, eel avocado, tuna princess roll, and 4 skewers. The squid skewers were gianormous and delicious with great seasoning. Tuna princess roll was delicious. Eel avocado roll did not have a lot of eel, and pieces were small, would recommend sticking with specialty roll. Poke bowl was eh, small pieces of salmon, can barely taste it. Was expecting larger cubes of fish as I am a huge fan of salmon. \n\nConclusion: Good portions, great specialty roll and skewers, good atmosphere and bubble tea, crappy eel avocado roll. Overall very solid, good concept combining bubble tea with sushi as main selling points as these are go-to for a lot of people in terms of drink and food respectively. Come check it out."

My wife and I sat in the rear of the restaurant in the half round booths. It was a more intimate setting than the front of the house. We both ordered oolong tea(with bubbles). She had the passion fruit and I had the honey oolong. The passion fruit was both of our favorite of the two. We also ordered miso soup and sea weed salad. Both were delicious and good sized portions. For our main course, we ordered two sushi rolls. The Spicy Girl and the Angry Dragon Roll. These had similar ingredients, but were totally different flavors. Onion rings\\straws in sushi??? It was very good!!  Bubble Fish was a delicious treat. We enjoyed it very much. Service was quick, efficient and very polite.\n\nSecond night in town went BACK to Bubblefish ordered everything differently and it was still all delicious. Salmon tacos were just the right mix of flavors. The Out of Control sushi roll was a well blend of flavors, but not overly hot(has jalape\u00f1o). The Bubble Fish Roll was also just a good mix of flavors. Guava oolong tea with bubbles was a close second to the passion fruit oolong.\nWait staff was attentive."

The drinks were absolutely amazing especially their yogurt drinks. Very mango was great. I even came back the second day to get it but decided on the rose oolong tea to try something different. If you're coming here to get sushi though, you should probably try somewhere else especially if you come from nyc. We ordered the princess roll and the the bubblefish roll. The princess roll is like 75% rice which destroyed the roll especially since the rice was noticeably not good. The bubblefish roll actually was a pretty interesting roll and I kinda liked the unique taste of it. The biggest problem i had with both rolls were the rice which was very clumpy, thick and soggy. It didn't really have much taste too and gave the rolls a bad texture to it.  Because of this rice issue, i wouldn't go back to get any rolls again. I haven't tried much of the other stuff so there might be better luck on that."

They totally ignore you even though they saw you waving your hand high up in the air. Majority of them just stands there and chat while keeping their customers waiting. They don't even wear hairnets, gloves or tie their hair up when making food. And they definitely don't know anything about the menu when you ask them.

Our \"snack\" turned into a feast and we had to push our dinner reservations. The variety of dishes on the menu really got us. Everything was really tasty, the large bubble teas were so big and inexpensive for the size. The sashimi tasted fresh and pieces were thick. I was pretty impressed on the presentation of our food. \n\nWe enjoyed this place and waiters were friendly and attentive!"

Only improve to note is there should be miso soup. But it is a fusion so can't expect them to do that. Been here over 30 times and has always been good. Enjoy!"

We arrived and were quickly seated, (no one was really there because everyone was smart enough to go home or stay home.) They gave us a choice to sit in a booth or a table and luckily my boyfriend said booth because I noticed that the tables are a little small. They seem to only fit drinks and not so much food so I wonder if this will be a potential problem for them in the future.\n\nThe menus were honestly hard to read because the flaps wouldn't crease so it felt like I was fighting the page open. This will not be a problem in the future since the pages will wear out and stay put eventually. \n\nI split 3 rolls and a drink with my boyfriend because I wasn't particularly hungry. Our server informed up that the kitchen was backed up. Honestly it was a lot longer than expected but I had good company so it didn't ruin my experience. Our server was really sweet and was helpful with the menu. \n\nI order a pineapple coconut green tea, large. You can only order a large when dining. The came in big jugs. It was okay. It reminded me of a confused pina colada because it had those flavors but just taste like pineapple juice in coconut milk. Will not order again. \n\nThe sushi, however, was great. I ordered the tuna princess, bubblefish, and eel avocado. The specialty rolls are nicely presented. The bubblefish was really good. I don't remember what was in it but I will order again. The sushi prices are average.\n\nI will definitely come back because they have a very interesting drink menu and their sushi is pretty good. The atmosphere is a little lacking but that is probably because I came in the midst of storm but I think this place has potential. I am excited for them to come back to try some other teas.\n\nTLDR; Gotta work out some kinks. Great service. Unfortunate wait time for food. Drink did not impress. Good sushi. Average prices. Will come again. Cash only."

Immediately the server came over to bring water and ask about any drink orders; not long after that, she came by again to refill our waters and to take our food orders. I decided on the sushi and sashimi platter for one, and we settled in to wait for the meal.\n\nOur drinks arrived first, and I was awed by the size of the milkshake--it was at least 25 oz and heavenly to drink. The sushi/sashimi platter arrived with a full explanation from the server--ahi and white tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and sake-marinated tuna (both sushi and sashimi), plus a salmon maki roll. I practically inhaled the food--the fish was really fresh and the maki was rolled well.\n\nIt ran us about fifty dollars. A bit pricey for a lunch with two people--but it's definitely affordable if you order a reasonable amount of sushi (I certainly did not stick to this advice), and the food is really well-crafted, so you are getting your money's worth. Plus the size of the milkshake. Come on, you know you want it."

My wife and I sat in the rear of the restaurant in the half round booths. It was a more intimate setting than the front of the house. We both ordered oolong tea(with bubbles). She had the passion fruit and I had the honey oolong. The passion fruit was both of our favorite of the two. We also ordered miso soup and sea weed salad. Both were delicious and good sized portions. For our main course, we ordered two sushi rolls. The Spicy Girl and the Angry Dragon Roll. These had similar ingredients, but were totally different flavors. Onion rings\\straws in sushi??? It was very good!!  Bubble Fish was a delicious treat. We enjoyed it very much. Service was quick, efficient and very polite."

I ordered their popular crispy chicken appetizer and found strands of hair in my chicken. At first I thought it was chicken hair and was not going to say anything. But after closer observation it was actually human hair. So I pointed it out to our waitress and she apologized and brought it back to the kitchen for a new one. We waited about 5 minutes and they brought it out, so obviously I look it over again and THE HAIR WAS STILL THERE. I don't think they even switched out my dish but just brought the same thing out again. Long story short they took the meal off my check and apologized for it but I don't think I will return again."

        "text": "I've been to bubble fish 3 times, and all 3 times the service was bad-mediocre. There's a lot of items on the menu so I'm definitely trying to come back and try new things and probably rate it higher. First off, the interior design is top notch! I love all the different lights they have. Ok, let's get into the drinks.\n\nI've tried the sea salt froth lychee, black tea, and green tea with Oreo toppings, mango milk shake, and tropical island smoothie (sharing all these with others of course lol). The sea salt teas are all pretty good, not too sweet, and I like the salty hint of the foam. It was a group consensus that the lychee was the best we had. The mango milkshake didn't taste like fresh mangos, more like powdered mix and a lot of condensed milk, but I could be wrong and they used A LOT of condensed milk because it was super sweet with an artificial mango taste. The tropical island smoothie was ok, a bit too watery for my liking. Overall the drinks here are pretty cool, all around $5+ There's only large options when dining in so you get your money's worth I guess. \n\nFood wise, I tried the Taiwanese salt baked chicken seeing it so popular on Yelp but I was not impressed. The chicken was almost a dark brown color (probably due to old oil) and this was within the first two weeks of them opening that I visited! I've had this dish at other places and they were so crispy and delicious, however, it was pretty much soggy here and super salty. The volcano chicken tasted like chicken katsu, so basically breaded chicken cutlets, it was OK nothing too crazy. I loved the salmon tacos, it was really refreshing. Not really a taco, basically a deep fried skin the size of a coaster topped with lettuce and salmon with spicy mayo; only 3 pieces to this order so it's not a lot (order 2 for 4+ people). We ordered the tuna princess roll, Marylin Monroll (clever), and the monster roll. I'm a big sushi fan, but non of these rolls stood out or were memorable to me. The fish didn't taste fresh and the taste didn't blend well together for me. The texture of the rice was also strange, kind of rubbery. My friend got some sashimi and her yellowtail still had ice on it, this was a big no. Again, fish wasn't fresh. Off the \"special\" menu I ordered the maryland oysters and this was probably my favorite thing here, it was soo delicious! The seasoning just really did it; some kind of soy sauce blend with fish eggs on top. For dessert, I've tried the cheesecake, the creme brulee, waffle with fruits, and accidentally, the mango snow ice. The cheesecake was mediocre, tasted like any ordinary cheesecake. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was pretty good, I enjoyed it. And lastly, I LIVE for shaved ice, it never disappoints. But I wanted the Vanilla snow ice and somehow got Mango brought out. It was overwhelmingly thick because it was drenched in condensed milk, the mango flavor in the ice was so powdery and the dish was extremely sweet. I couldn't even finish it, and I never leave shaved ice unfinished. \n\nLastly, service. The first time I came, servers had trouble understanding our orders. Brought out two false drinks. Service was really slow. The second time I came, I only ordered desserts and drinks, and literally took us 20 minutes to get our stuff, the restaurant was only half full both times. The last time I came, service was the fastest. It was a busy Friday night at 9PM so I guess they were trying to turn tables quickly, but there was no one waiting at the door! I felt like servers were rushing everything, they checked if we were ready to order every minute since we stepped in. We got our food pretty fast. I literally had servers try to remove my plate of oysters 4 times, only to put it down because I wasn't finished with my food. When they came to clear my table, I ordered vanilla shaved ice. The waitress came back with a mango shaved ice and quickly left, I didn't even get to tell her it was wrong, but I stuck with it because I hate difficult customers. So there we are, it would be a 4 stars based on the food, but 3 because of service."

We ordered several rolls, and as I looked around the restaurant, everyone's sushi was beautifully presented on special wooden blocks, and platters - 10/10 for presentation. To add, they have a wide selection of teas/bubble teas/smoothies to go with your meal. \n\nMy favorite: THE VERY MANGO SMOOTHIE - highly recommend, it's a huge mug and it's great for sharing. We got the spicy maki combo, the shrimp tempura onigiri, the monster roll, the oyster ninja, and the eel avocado roll. ALLLLL FANTASTIC. Rice to fish ratio was perfection (I'm a huge sushi ratio fanatic - I like little rice and lots of content)\n\nIt came in this huge bamboo/wooden disc platter, perfectly aligned and very picture worthy. Fish was FRESH and rolls were packed. The prices were all very adequate and fair, I'd say it was a bang for my buck. Overall, super pleased with my meal. Ladies who were serving with us, super nice and sweet. Super attentive to our table, I love that. \n\nI'd definitely be returning!!"

You truly get a bang for your buck if you order drinks from here. They come in large glasses or cute mason jars depending on what you order. I recommend the avocado smoothie; they use quality avocados and the glass it comes in is humungous, you could honestly become full from the drink itself. They also have some loose tea selections that come in a cute, transparent teapot set with tiny glasses. Totally shareable and warm, as it stays over a candle that surprisingly keeps the tea hot.\n\nThe bad: The food selection. For the past dozen times I've come here I've tried so many different menu items, hoping to find something I love. Unfortunately, everything is pretty pricey and not comparable to the many other food selections out here in Chinatown. What I do suggest if you're looking for a good deal are the sushi combos i.e Spicy Maki Combo. You get three rolls for about $13. However, keep in mind that if you order a drink, your total will be about $20 or more by the end of the night just because of tip and tax added in. \n\nThat's what I dislike; no matter what you order, your meal will end up being much pricier than necessary and the food experience was underwhelming (aside from sitting in some pretty atmosphere with a tasty drink).\n\nOverall, the service, atmosphere, and drinks are delicious. The food? I'll pass."

The name was misleading because there was more than just shrimp tempura. The sashimi and sushi platter was pretty good and decently proportioned for 2 people. One thing that I would like to say was that there was too much rice for the sushi. The salmon sushi and the salmon sashimi would have to be my favourite out of all the pieces. It is a great place to go for your sushi, sashimi and tempura fix."

Mostly sushi dishes, but they also serve \"combo boxes,\" ramen, and other unique dishes. They also have lots of different bubble tea/smoothie drinks. Of note, they are BYOB if you want to bring in your own alcohol. I did not go for the sushi when I came here, but instead I went for an avocado/eel Onigiri, which is like a sushi ball, their Sushi Burger, and their fried wings appetizer. All of them were pretty appetizing, but it was tough eating the sushi burger despite them giving me a knife to try to chop it up. However, I've never had a sushi burger, so it was rather unique. The wings are also a bit oily, but the spicy sauce was decent. The onigiri was honestly one of the better ones I've ever tried. My friend got the Chirashi, which was slightly disappointed and loaded with radish. Service was okay, but could be a little more attentive. Overall, I enjoyed the place, but probably wouldn't come back on my own unless a group of friends want to go.\n\nPros: BYOB, Onigiri\nCons: Meh food"

I wouldn't say the food is mind-blowing, but it was pretty tasty. My favorite was the salt baked chicken, which had an interesting flavor and was very tender while crispy on the outside. The Marilyn Monroll was also a solid sushi option for the price, though I have had better sushi at higher-end sushi places in town. I was a bit surprised by the pork sung onigiri, because I've never had pork sung like the one here, which was drier/crumblier/saltier than I'm used to. I ended up liking the eel & avocado onigiri better. I also felt the green tea crepe cake was a bit dry - as if they made it a couple days before.\n\nI think the main attraction of this place is the extensive tea and milkshake menu, and I think they nailed it. I don't know how many times I'd have to go there to try all of the flavors, but they have hot tea sets, bubble tea, sweet teas with milk foam, etc... they all look very delicious.

I even came and started knocking on the door and called again and again. No response or acknowledgement that we were even there. I also saw there were workers inside. What was going on? I wish there was better communication. Would have liked at least a call back. Still waiting for a call back but had to leave to go to the bathroom so couldn't wait much longer."

Totally insta worthy and definitely highly recommended for any sashimi lover.\n\nThe beef curry came with stir fry veggies that ended up being my favorite part of the meal. What a surprise!

The sashimi was delicate, fresh, and really showed off each fish to the greatest effect. Next was a set of nigiri on properly prepared sushi rice. (That's hard to get in Philly--most places make it mushy or lumpy.) The platter ended with a \"fun\" roll, which was delicious in an indulgent way. At this point, we felt more comfortable drinking our tankards of delicious bubble tea! (I got the fermented rice variety, which was a great change from the usual. Like milk tea with a mild soju flavor.) Overall: Great value for money, cute surroundings, attentive service, and Japanese food that both impresses and satisfies!"

Bonus points for 7% Yelp Cash Back if you have your card registered!\n\nWho/When: \nI came one time with a friend on a Tuesday night, we got a booth with a lovely overhead light. Our server was attentive.\n\nFood: We ordered a Very Mango drink and a matcha smoothie - both had great depth of flavors. The Very Mango had the popping bubbles that give a little splash of color when you take a sip of the smoothie concoction. It had a great mango flavor without being overly sweet. My friend's matcha drink had a strong and distinct matcha flavor.\nThe takoyaki was nice and warm with a lovely mayo sauce and a good ratio of batter to the octopus.\nThe tonkatsu don ($11.95) was not to disappoint. I think it was a beautiful cutlet that came in a nice skillet overlaying a pan of rice and egg. Each piece was thinly sliced and had a strong earthy flavor.\n\nSecond time:\nClose to closing on a Saturday night with two others. I tried to order shaved ice but they were out :(\nInstead, I ordered the Taiwanese pop corn chicken $6 - each bite size was nice, salty peppery goodness. I do think the meat was a bit too sweet but was nicely tender.\nThe tonkatsu ramen of my friend had a strong depth of flavor and definitely would recommend this over the miso flavor which was virtually bland. \n\nTips/Takeaways:\n++ to the Very Mango and Matcha smoothies\n++ Takoyaki was good and I could see myself getting this again\n+ Popcorn chicken was fine, but I think the sweetness outweighed the earthy tones I was looking for\n+++Tonkatsu don was definitely worth it as a filling skillet of food\n+Definitely Tonkatsu over Miso ramen if you don't have a dietary restriction\n-Would recommend return probably every 3-5 months for a casual plate of Taiwanese/Japanese food.

Being a YouTube vlogger, they expressed openness to having me film inside (probably because it was increase their publicity but this place did the job well). \n\nEnvironment: For a place in Chinatown, this definitely has a very classy up-scale feel inside. Restrooms are really neat, tables are extremely organized, very spacious, and never really too crowded..\n\nService: This place is extremely excellent in their service. If you actually come here \"often\" enough to the extent of recognition, you can score yourself a VIP card which allows you to get 10% off when you pay with cash (I really appreciated earning this VIP card.)\n\nFood: Easily one of the best poke bowls in Philly. I've tried nicer places in No. Libs that had better \"tasting\" and flavorful poke bowls; however, the price to quality ratio was extremely well balanced and has been one of my favorite things to get here. The sushi here is OK; however, I'd like to note that they do have sushi burgers. Despite this isn't the most \"high-class\" thing to get, it's rare to find sushi burgers in Philly. I appreciated how they had a good amount of moist tenderness on the inside of the burger between two patties of rice. It is purely, rice, onions, different types of fake crab meat, and fish. DEFINITELY worth a try once if you are a general sushi fan.. I also really enjoyed their hot Jasmine tea! Despite it being on the pricey side (compared to your standard bubble tea or cafe spot), it was definitely an excellent compliment to the meal (so please note: there is no free hot tea like most other places in Chinatown).\n\nPrice: After tax and tip I'd say expect to pay $15-18 depending if you get appetizers, drinks, etc."

Overtime, the sourness of the rice and the marinade from the salmon and tuna melded together into a flavor of its own.

Prices were average. ordered Salmon sushi Burger, chicken teriyaki bento box, 2 rolls, edamame, pineapple fried rice, Taiwanese Salt Baked Chicken and Takoyaki. It was all very fulfilling and we didn't have room for dessert but hope to be back soon. \n\nFood:\nThe sushi burger was BOMB. I was worried the rice would over power the salmon filing but it was the perfect combo. \n\nThai tea bubble tea was good. It had a lot of tapioca bubbles which is always my favorite. \n\nWe ordered the angry dragon roll and the marylin monroll they tasted fresh. \n\nPineapple fried rice had to be sent back because there was barely any pineapple they kindly took it back and brought back a fresh plate with pineapple. \n\nSalted chicken was indeed salty. the chicken was tender and cooked perfectly. \n\ntakoyaki was ehh. It was more of a fried ball barely any of the balls had any octopus. If you ask for extra sauce they will charge you. They also charge for a side of spicy mayo which i notice is becoming more common at most sushi places. \n\nOverall definitely recommend!"

        "text": "I walked by this place for a few months and wasn't sure what it was (bubble tea? restaurant?). Then my friend told me it was sushi/japanese inspired dishes with bubble tea. \n\nI was intrigued and was going to head over for lunch, but it was raining so i opted for dinner instead. My group of 3 was super hungry so we ordered a variety of things to taste the menu. \n\ntaiwanese salt baked chicken\nfried calamari\neel and avocado onigiri\npork sung onigiri\nTGI Fresh roll\nAngry dragon roll (i think that was the name)\nTonkatsu don\nbraised beef soup\n\nmilk taro black tea\nsalt foam winter melon green tea\n\nI enjoyed everything we ordered but that might have been because i was hungry. I typically don't order sushi rolls at all but thought since they had so many special rolls that i try to see if they execute them well. I'm more of a chirashi guy 99% of the time. Plus we were sharing so rolls were easier to be family style. \n\nI liked that the calamari were big and \"meaty\" compared to other places. The taiwanese chicken had the western china style flavors...reminds me of the chicken app over at Shanghai 1..not necessarily a bad thing, but not super amazing. The eel and avocado onigir was pretty good. The pork sung was a let down...i didn't know what 'pork sung' was... for some reason i pictured meat meat... For those wondering, pork sung is the Chinese meat \"wool\" (kinda like cotton). I use to eat that all the time when i was a kid so it wasn't a flavor thing, it was more of a let down because its not really a Japanese ingredient. Its pretty salty (naturally) so it might be good old school app for those interested. \n\nThe two rolls came with soy wrap which is a good change (its flavorless in my opinion so those that don't like seaweed would like it). As always, these special rolls are kinda drowned by American style sauces... They weren't bad, but i'd probably try their chirashi next time to see if they have good fish in general. The rolls i can't really taste the fish. Had good texture though. \n\nThe Tonkasu had the same breading as the calamari (i could be wrong, but tasted very similar). It wasn't anything special. I felt they are frying in a heavier oil or something (calamari and tonkatsu). I tasted my friends braised beef soup. It wasn't a traditional chinese/taiwan flavor profile...the noodles were chewing which i liked, but my friend didn't. I thought the dish was good. \n\nThe salt foam winter melon green tea was pretty bomb. That was the main reason i wanted to come here. There aren't many if any places in philly that serve salt foam (correct me if i'm wrong).I seen it on youtube a few times and really wanted to try it. My friends said their tar tea was \"watered\" down, but i think they got it confused...They thought they were getting a taro tea but it was BLACK TEA with taro flavor. They didn't enjoy it because i think they had a different perception of what they were ordering. I tried it and it was good. They did complain it wasn't cold since it wasn't served with ice. \n\nNote: My friends said the rice in the onigiri and sushi had way too much rice wine vinegar--so much so that it tasted sour. I honestly didn't taste any at all. I dont' think they use \"real\" sushi rice as the grains are bit off color and size/shape. It isn't a deal breaker to me since i rarely eat rice but others might find fault. One friend said the place is 2 stars, the other 3.5 stars. My overall experience was elevated by the winter melon tea and the great service, so it is a solid 4 stars for me. Food might be 3.5. I would dock a bit more for being cash only. But prices for food were a tad lower than comparable places so you do save on that."

It's delicious, consistent, and the service is great. \n\nThis time, I got the Marilyn Monroll, White Tiger roll, and Tuna Princess roll, with fatty tuna sashimi. \n\nThe Marilyn Monroll is a favorite and I always order it when I'm here. Keep in mind that the photo of the sashimi is two orders. The White Tiger roll, I think, is a new sushi roll and I did enjoy itThe fatty tuna is smooth, but I wouldn't say it was worth the money. \n\nI also recommend trying the Very Mango bubble tea drink. It's huge and can be easily split between two people. The edamame, takoyaki and Taiwanese Salt Baker Chicken are all good appetizers."

The food is always just top notch, I honestly have not tried one thing that I didn't like... I can say that I have not sampled the raw food here as that's just not my thing but I luv the cooked selections... \n\nSome good suggestions for you is the lamb and beef skewers... They have this amazing cumin blend of seasoning that just elevates the meats... Another one of my ultimate favorites is the Unagi Don... now I've tried eel at several places but they just get it right here... Not a very large portion and just the right amount of sweetness that doesn't over power the dish... Now this review wouldn't be complete without talking about the drinks here... Once I find something I luv, I tend to stay put and the Very Mango shake is just what I need for a refreshing treat.. If you luv the taste of pure mango, then you won't be disappointed...\n\nThese are some of my favorite jewels from this place but I don't think you could go wrong with any selection here..."

        "text": "Came here on a Wednesday evening because my boyfriend heard about their sushi burger. I previously read that it gets messy and ends up like a pok\u00e9 bowl... IT'S TRUE. I ordered the salmon sushi burger and there's no way you could eat it like a real burger. I was quite disappointed in it simply because I barely tasted salmon. I tasted more onions. Definitely not worth the $15.\n\nWe also tried one roll - their signature Bubblefish roll. It was tasty, however, once again, the sauce they used overpowered the taste of the sushi. My boyfriend also ordered the shoyu ramen for $10. He said it is worth the money if you were to compare the price of ramen elsewhere. But let's be real, I wouldn't go here if I was craving ramen.\n\nEnded up going to Bubblefish again a week later because my friend wanted to try it after seeing pics of my salmon burger. We all just ended up ordering sushi rolls. I felt this time around, the sushi tasted SO much better. My boyfriend ordered sushi heaven and said everything tasted fresh. My friend enjoyed her rolls as well. I haven't tried their bubble tea though.. just not open to trying it when I know there are other bubble tea places nearby.\n\nThe service was quick, but can be a little intrusive. Perhaps they were over staffed that time, but they kept asking if we were done when there was still food clearly visible. The ambiance is great. The chairs are comfortable. (Avoid the booths up front if you're wearing shorts. The seats are peeling and definitely need to be replaced.) They give lemon water, however if you want plain water, that is available too.\n\nBased on both experiences, I would give this place a 3.5 (being generous with giving 4 stars rather than 3). Not my first choice for sushi, but would come again."

Instead of not accepting my order to begin with, this place accepted my order, cooked it up real quick and sat my order OUTSIDE their front door for anyone to just walk up and grab with no employee in site! My driver told me this as he delivered my phone and suggested \"he wouldn't eat it, cause it was just literally sitting outside on the sidewalk\"! This is not okay in the slightest and even more unacceptable during this pandemic we're all facing! This is plain and simple 100% pure greed by taking the order to begin with knowing they were gonna put it outside when they were done and go home for the night! Thanks now my family isn't going to have the $40 order of sushi we paid for! I would give negative stars if possible!"

Originally thought it was mainly a drink place but it was so much more and excellent all around. \n\nInterior is spacious and well decorated. Got a nice table at the window. I had the Mango Drink (Forget the name). It was delicious! A hefty helping and was topped with some mango pieces as well as had juice filled bubbles at the bottom. Very refreshing. I had the Tuna Burger which was very interesting and also very delicious. I guess it was kind of like a poke bowl in burger form. Sushi rice with sesame seeds made the \"buns,\" seaweed paper was the cheese, and tuna and spicy crabmeat with avocado and lettuce. A bit messy to eat (they gave a knife and fork) and it was especially difficult on the shape of the plate they gave me. But regardless, it was a nice mix of flavors and very good. Filling as well. \n\nService was fine and prices were reasonable for China Town. \n\nWalked by this place a million times and now I'm not sure why it took me so long to try it out. Definitely recommend checking it out!"

We come here all the time and never have had to wait more than a few minutes for a table. We never even thought to make a reservation in the past. We came Friday night and it was packed. I don't mind waiting but they need to get more organized in how they handle a wait. They took our name/number down and told us it would be at least 40 minutes, so we could go somewhere else to wait if we want. We decided to go to a nearby bar for a drink in the meantime. Under 20 minutes later, they call and say our table is ready. I let them know we still had to finish our drink and we would be there in 10 minutes. They argued on the phone that they can't hold our table that long. If they had told us 20 minutes, we never would have left in the first place. We then had to chug our beers and run back, which was unnecessarily stressful. \n\nThey also have changed their BYOB policy and now are charging 5 dollars a bottle. This includes beer.. we had 2 beers and a bottle of wine and they wanted to charge us 10 bucks to open them. To change the policy in a matter of 2 months, not display it anywhere on the website, and then charge people is outrageous. It's just the principle. \n\nThe food is still good and I can't say anything negative about that, but I just think they're getting a little big for their britches. They could do better by making the alcohol policy clear on their website and Yelp and organizing their wait times better."

It really wowed me when it came out. The rice burger was actually pretty good. The whole thing itself wasn't really balanced. Too much sauce and not enough meats. I tasted more of the bacon itself rather than the salmon.\n\nTaiwanese Salt Baked Chicken - these were pretty amazing. Wasn't overly battered and the flavoring was perfect.\n\nCrabmeat Salad Onigiri - My kids enjoyed this the best. The amount of sauce mixed the the crab meat came to a really nice blend.\n\nWe ordered 2 rolls (Out of Control and Marilyn Monroll) - They were both SO SWEET! I could not finish them.

There's a TV screen in the back, and your drinks come in cute jars. \n\nDrinks: We ended up ordering the the honey jasmine tea with boba. Although it was a \"cold\" bubble tea, it didn't come with ice, which was nice since there was nothing to water down the flavors of the tea. The boba was sweet and chewy, and the tea wasn't too sweet at all. \n\nFood: The rolls were delicious. They all had the perfect rice to filling ratio, and the rice itself was very flavorful. We shared the shrimp tempura roll, the bubblefish roll, and the sushi mako combo. While the bubblefish roll was my favorite, the sushi mako combo was a great deal since it came with 3 rolls. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back again.

Only cast and crew know this, and of course, I'm both (tosses hair).\n\nSo at first, I was absolutely delighted that they have black sugar milk tea here... but a little bit less delighted with the actual product. It was a lacking in something. It didn't taste like brown or black sugar. I was disser-pointed, both with the drink and my spelling.\n\nThe service was okay. They're a big, lavish, busy place with a lot of fancy ish sit-down dining going on. It looks like it would be a nice place for a date night. \n\nBut certainly the bubble teas are not too cheap, especially considering the unusual and troubling fact that they only sell large. Despite the excellent selection I wasn't thrilled with the one that I got. Black sugar AKA brown sugar AKA Okinawa is my addiction so I've had way too many of them to count. A lot of places do make them well but a lot of places don't, and this is the latter.

No matter-K. has a mind of his own, so after doing my other familial and social rounds on 12/25, the afternoon found me wandering rather aimlessly around Race, Arch, 9th and 10th Streets as Kingsley studiously consulted his phone in order to find places that were open. \n\nWe supped modestly at a few hole in the wall stand bys that probably never close but he still was in need of more dopamine and ethanol refreshment so he told me cocktails at Bubblefish would be just the ticket. While I'd never been to the place before, I also didn't think it had a bar or any cocktails, speciality or otherwise, and told him so. He gave me The Look and said he'd call lest I waste my time and wear out precious shoe leather just walking over to see if that was the case. The phone rang and rang-maybe 20 rings-before it was picked up. My friend was told the restaurant was open and he asked if they served cocktails. The party on the other end seemed flummoxed as to the definition of 'cocktails' so Kingsley changed the query to, \"Do you serve booze?\" and was met with the equivalent of 'huh?!\" He looked at me for help and I suggested asking if there was a liquor license and did they serve alcohol. That got a resounding yes, so he grabbed my scarf and pulled me along with a vengeance to 9th and Arch.\n\nThe place was reasonably populated but even though there were a good number of seats in the front of the house, we were shown to a way too big for two banquette over by the toilets. As we were led to the seats of shame, I noticed no bar or bottles anywhere. Not good. \n\nWe were given a menu-a food menu-and left to peruse and decide. Since we had been eating lightly but steadily for a few hours, we felt a drink or two would suffice along with 2 or 3 small plates of something. We choose chicken skewers, beef skewers, shrimp tempura and takoyaki. There was no drink menu so when our server re-appeared to take our order, K. asked for the drinks menu. The young woman pointed out the many iterations of bubble tea, citing a few of her favorites. Kingsley was having none of it and said he wanted a glass of wine or beer. The woman looked offended and said there was no beer and wine was only sold in bottles. We opted for a pot of hot tea and I had to put up with my friend's angry bitching until our food arrived. \n\nThe shrimp tempura promised 3 shrimp in the menu. We were served only 2 along with a pile of tasteless, greasy vegetables. The frying oil was not hot enough so each piece of tempura was enrobed in a limp, oil sopping coat of breading. Some pieces were unidentifiable-lotus root? Potato? Mushroom? The shrimp tasted frozen and old. Both kinds of skewers came with no sauce or seasoning, just protein on a stick, and over cooked at that. We tried to get the server's attention several times to cancel the takoyaki since we did not want to stay or eat anything else. She ignored us and then sat down to take a break. I suggested we go to the cashier and ask to skip the takoyaki since we had now been waiting far too long but Kingsley wanted to be miserable so he sat and complained that I was a horse's ass to choose this place. I was just getting up to go to the front and ask to pay for the meal when the takoyaki showed up. Kingsley said we had waited far too long for it, we had finished all the other food and wanted it taken off the bill.  The young server seemed upset, apologized and said she would package it up to go. At that point, I just wanted to get out of the restaurant and my (ahem) friend's company and go home to some spiked eggnog, Madonna singing \"Santa Baby\" and a few Dave Koz tunes. We paid. We left. \n\nBubblefish may very well be good for sushi; I'll never know. I do know that they don't serve cocktails, they don't have a bar and their tempura game is way way off. \n\nBah! Humbug!"

The Sashimi Heaven was to die for.  The sashimi was perfectly cut in thickness and very fresh.  The sushi chef, Edison has won awards before and continues to compete in competitions.  The Spicy Garlic Edamame was a little too spicy and just did not really go well together in taste.  The Veal with Black Pepper Sauce was basted in a tasty sauce, not too chewy but tender and soft.  The Salmon Taco was creative and interesting. The TGI Fresh Roll was filling.  The Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup had a little herbal medicine added into the broth.  The Tofu Mousse Cheese Cake was delectable, and not too sweet.  The (Almond) Panna Cotta was good, it reminded me of Almond chilled tofu you can get at dim sum.  However, the Lychee Panna Cotta from a related competitor in Chinatown is better.  \n\nThe tea brand that they use for their drinks is Possmei.  A brand from Taiwan that Tea Talk (later turned Tea Chat, and now is Mr. Wish) used to use.  So glad to have a place in Chinatown that uses Possmei again.  The drinks in-house are very generous in size.  Pack it into a to-go cup if you dined in and can't finish.  We did not have as much decor on our drinks (garnishes or floating boba) like the photos on their Facebook page.  That would have been nice to have on our drinks, more decoration.\n\nI definitely plan on coming back to try more things on the menu.  This place is kid friendly.  I have already recommended this place to many friends.  I feel fortunate to have a restaurant like this now in my neighborhood of Chinatown Philly."

We were freaking starving when we finally walked into a half full Bubblefish on a Sunday afternoon (thankfully didn't have to endure the infamous long waits). The place is modern and classy (worry not, you can still dress casual). The service was very attentive and fast. LOVEDDD the seats - so comfy! \n\nFor food we ordered two special rolls, the monster one and the Marilyn one. For appetizers we ordered the spicy garlic edamame and the veal with black pepper sauce. Lastly we ordered the salmon sushi burger. \n\nEven though we came here for sushi.... the veal might have been my favorite part. Holy ishhhhh, it was so tender and rich - I'm salivating as I remember it. The spicy garlic edamame is also a great appetizer. The sushi was really good and filling. I think I might have liked the Marylin better but it was cool to have oyster in the monster roll (I freaking love oysters). The salmon sushi burger, ngl, I was a little disappointed. I'm a rice fiend but that was toooooo much rice. I don't know what I expected considering that the buns would be rice but I somehow expected the dish to be more balanced, after all, it's not like bread overpowers a normal burger? But the rice was definitely overpowering the dish which is weird to say since it's not a spice or something of the like. The salmon and fillings inside burger were great though.\n\nOverall a great experience, great presentation, great service."

We tried both the Salmon and the Tuna Burger. They basically have rice buns with a sheet of seaweed and then a bunch of filling. While the salmon one was good, the tuna one was amazing. The tuna was perfectly done and and seemed like it was seared on the side and was paired so well with the crab, avocado, sauces, etc. The fried onion also gave it more texture. I am literally drooling writing this review. We also tried the Mars sushi roll, which I really liked but my boyfriend wasn't as much of a fan of since he doesn't love cream cheese. Overall, 11/10 and would definitely come back for that tuna burger and to try some of their drinks!!"

The space is pretty decent with a variety of different types of seating, and one larger room in the back where our party of about 15 had dinner last weekend. \n\nEven though sushi is the prominent option in the menu, they offer a variety of other palatable (and generally less expensive) options including ramen, donkatsu, and the likes. The palpably most exciting part of the menu though is the different types of tea offered, including a unique \"sea salt froth tea\" that comes in a GIANT glass (closely resembling a beer mug). Several of us had a lively chat about whether \"froth\" is a noun or a verb (Siri helped us out a lil) as we looked in fascination at the thick layer of foam that blanketed the drink.\n\nFinally, they have a cool moving light projection of their logo onto the sidewalk so that you can't miss it if you're walking by at night! Check it out if you're in the area :)"

It's very obvious Bubblefish takes pride in their food. I don't typically prefer any type of white fish but I think Bubblefish sears it in a way that it just melts in your mouth. \n\nI've also had their spicy garlic edamame...which is amazing.  There is no such thing as too much garlic and Bubblefish understands that. And like everyone else, we love the Very Mango drink.  I highly advise you get the less sugar version as it is already sweet enough.  It is extremely large too and easily shareable between two people.  Overall...incredible sushi and tea!"

This was pretty surprising and disappointing to be honest, especially because the store did not look particularly crowded. President's Day isn't really a \"big holiday\" in my opinion that would warrant denying a customer a lunch special . . . my wife and I just ended up ordering one roll each of salmon roll and spicy tuna roll. Usually at other places, when you get the basic rolls you can get avocado with them - for example Alaskan rolls which come with salmon and avocado. The rolls we got only had the meat with nothing else added, and they looked grounded up/processed. Taste-wise they tasted like sushi you might order to-go from your local grocery store. It definitely wasn't bad but I thought it was pretty mediocre for a restaurant. The service was okay. For two simple rolls on a non-crowded day however it took about 20 minutes which I thought was a little longer than I would expect. The server did come around to refill our water. Upon leaving, the server told us that we could not pay with credit card because we did not meet the $15 credit card minimum. I have gone to Bubblefish before and I think the atmosphere inside looks great. I remember the specialty rolls were also pretty solid. After this pretty spectacularly disappointing experience however I can say strongly that we will not be returning."

I don't regret trying it.\n\nWhen the sushi burger finally came, it looked magnificent. It looked fairly small, but when you pick it up, it's heavier than it looks. From my first bite, to my last bite, the sushi burger completely blew me away. I love sushi, and I love burgers, and now I can say I love Bubblefish's sushi burger.\n\nThe sushi burger is made up of ahi tuna (I think?), spicy tuna, and I believe spicy salmon.

I come to chinatown often to try new spots and I decided to give this one a try after it grabbed my attention from its attention grabbing signage out front.  \n\nI was excited to try this spot.  It was very chic looking inside with a bright environment that brought out an energy inside me large enough to eat an entire horse.  The menu was an interesting take as it had solid wood covers, front and back.  The menu was quite diverse and offered many different options.  LOTS of drinks as well as abundant selections of sushi, ramen bowls, and don (an rice dish entree).  Make no mistake that this is a Japanese restaurant---it offers quite the selection of the three dishes previously mentioned and so everyone will find something they want to eat here.  \n\nI decided to eat big tonight and ordered the fried calamari and tonkontsu don (a crispy pan fried pork cutlet over rice to start.  It did not take too long for the food to come out--a little over 10 min.  The calamari rings were thick juicy pieces.  Lots of mass and aesthetically very pleasing -- these came from a big squid.  The thickness of the rings made it so they had some chew to it and but this was due to the size of the rings and not how they were made.  Not my favorite but still very tasty! -- I finished them all :-)  Quite the deal at only $7\n\nThe tonkotsu don was a beast of a dish and had a large pork cutlet over a stack of rice.  Good dish if you are starving!   The pork was perfect--the thickness and crispiness were just right.  Umami satisfied for sure!!!  $12 price.  Average price for this dish here.  \n\nI could not leave without trying the Very Mango...  No way in hell.\n\nThis drink was a BEAST.  In fact all their drinks are massive works of art.  I am thinking the size of the glasses for this and the bubble teas were at least 24 oz.  What is a Very Mango you might ask?  What makes this mango drink extra mango to deserve the term \"Very\" - a word that denotes more than just regular mango?  Well...mango milk shake, orange juice, mango puree, yogurt pops.  It's quite mango-y!\n\nI will definitely be adding this on my Chinatown list here in Philly.  I only have a few spots that I visit regularly and so this place checked off many boxes during my visit.  \n\nOne thing to note -- $15 credit card minimum.  That is a bit high but they do have an ATM at the entrance.  Also, the bathrooms are individual style and were quite clean upon use.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and give this place a try!

(It was the whole point of the restaurant) but disappointment quickly turned when our food came out. The sushi was pretty decent, we got the little mermaid. (better than teriyaki boy) I got the salmon bento box, my mom the veal combo platter and my kid just wanted the Taiwanese chicken. It was all amazing. The perfect amount of grill, seasonings and flavors. \nThough the food was amazing I can't wait to come back to sample their large menus of drinks and teas. I also really loved that they thought of family friendly restrooms.(you have no idea how many times I had to balance my kid on a chair or put a mat on the dirty floor to change a diaper in any Philly restaurants.)"

I then ended up eating the food in the car, but had to spit most of it out because I was basically eating cream cheese with a tiny side of cucumber, rice and salmon. I'm speaking specifically for the Philadelphia Roll. Do not, I repeat DO NOT order this or any other items with \"salmon\" in it. The salmon is not sushi grade salmon, and it does not smell or taste like it's for raw consumption. I'm not sure what they used, but do yourself a favor and just steer clear. The Philadelphia Roll had more cream cheese than an extra cream cheese bagel. I want my money back, but based on the customer service I'm not sure the $39 of chewed up and spit out food is going to make it back into my pocket."

The grass jelly took a little longer but came out in a heaping bowl and my choice of 3 toppings (included): boba, taro, and aloe jelly.

I love soft shell crab so I chose the Mars Roll (Soft shell crab, cream cheese, jalapeno, avocado, shiso). The combination of flavors were a perfect bite which almost melted in  your mouth. My wife got the Marilyn Monroll (Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, avocado, topped with torched white tuna, sampal garlic sauce) which I might add is one of the cutest names I've seen for a roll. It to was delicious and I would have been happy with either roll. What really surprised me was the quantity for the price.

Their special drinks menu is super extensive - they have all kinds of speciality drinks that range from boba tea, regular tea, yogurt drinks, milkshakes, jelly drinks, and more. They were unfortunately out of the lavender milk oolong which I initially tried to order, and I feel like this is probably a popular drink choice. When I was here, I got The Force Awakens coffee milkshake with chocolate which was very good (actually not very sweet which was perfect), two onigiri (sweet potato and eel) two rolls (the TGIFresh Roll and Out of Control Roll), fried oysters, Taiwanese Beef Stew Noodles, and the lunchbox deal with teriyaki lamb. It was way too much food but my partner and I definitely could at least have leftovers to last us for a whole other dinner! My partner ordered the fermented rice oolong boba, and it's got that shot of liquor kind of taste to it from the fermented rice, so really make sure to mix it in well and sip it along with the rest of the tea (we accidentally  sipped initially from the rice settled at the bottom, oops!)\n\nEverything was really good: starting with the rolls, they were average priced but definitely huge and really delicious. We honestly filled up just on that. The onigiri were great, and Bubblefish actually had a nice variety and some of the biggest and tastiest ones I've had in Chinatown.  The Taiwanese beef noodles were something new that I really enjoyed, and the beef was cooked and marinated really well. The lunchbox was slightly disappointing - we only got 4 tiny pieces of lamb with our box, and I didn't see how this was worth the money at all. It was well cooked but definitely tiny portion-wise. We did enjoy the tempura it came with though, and the California rolls in it were fine but nothing special. The fried oysters were fried to perfection and were really interesting (think takoyaki, but oysters instead of octopus pieces). Overall it was a good experience, and a solid place to bring others when you don't know what you want to eat and want a ton of options at good quality. It did end up being pricey, and that definitely could be because we just ordered so much food, but I think comparatively speaking you could take half of what we spent and spend it elsewhere for the same amount of food in other Chinatown restaurants. It felt a little pricier than average. The ambiance is cute in the front part of the restaurant, but we were seated in the back in a more secluded, dark part with not a whole lot going for it. Service was great, and we're thankful for the waiters who were extremely patient with us just truly not knowing what we wanted."

I come to chinatown often to try new spots and I decided to give this one a try after it grabbed my attention from its attention grabbing signage out front.  \n\nI was excited to try this spot.  It was very chic looking inside with a bright environment that brought out an energy inside me large enough to eat an entire horse.  The menu was an interesting take as it had solid wood covers, front and back.  The menu was quite diverse and offered many different options.  LOTS of drinks as well as abundant selections of sushi, ramen bowls, and don (an rice dish entree).  Make no mistake that this is a Japanese restaurant---it offers quite the selection of the three dishes previously mentioned and so everyone will find something they want to eat here.  \n\nI decided to eat big tonight and ordered the fried calamari and tonkontsu don (a crispy pan fried pork cutlet over rice to start.  It did not take too long for the food to come out--a little over 10 min.  The calamari rings were thick juicy pieces.  Lots of mass and aesthetically very pleasing -- these came from a big squid.  The thickness of the rings made it so they had some chew to it and but this was due to the size of the rings and not how they were made.  Not my favorite but still very tasty! -- I finished them all :-)  Quite the deal at only $7\n\nThe tonkotsu don was a beast of a dish and had a large pork cutlet over a stack of rice.  Good dish if you are starving!   The pork was perfect--the thickness and crispiness were just right.  Umami satisfied for sure!!!  $12 price.  Average price for this dish here.  \n\nI could not leave without trying the Very Mango...  No way in hell.\n\nThis drink was a BEAST.  In fact all their drinks are massive works of art.  I am thinking the size of the glasses for this and the bubble teas were at least 24 oz.  What is a Very Mango you might ask?  What makes this mango drink extra mango to deserve the term \"Very\" - a word that denotes more than just regular mango?  Well...mango milk shake, orange juice, mango puree, yogurt pops.  It's quite mango-y!\n\nI will definitely be adding this on my Chinatown list here in Philly.  I only have a few spots that I visit regularly and so this place checked off many boxes during my visit.  \n\nOne thing to note -- $15 credit card minimum.  That is a bit high but they do have an ATM at the entrance.  Also, the bathrooms are individual style and were quite clean upon use.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and give this place a try!   You won't regret it."

The menu, presentation of the dishes, quality of the fish, prices, servers and restaurant atmosphere all contribute to their five star review. They have the largest offering of traditional drinks I've seen and their hot tea is so beautifully presented. Our server offered us two refills with no charge, even though it is water it was still nice. \n\nI ordered the sashimi heaven, which was reasonably priced at $21 for 17 pieces. The presentation was gorgeous and the sashimi slices were decent in size and very fresh. I'd even venture to say the tuna seemed like the best quality I've had in awhile. I had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert, you can't go wrong with that. One thing I did think was strange on their menu is their rolls have no eel, they still look good though. I will definitely be back regardless."

We came in after 25 minutes to pick up our food and they said it would take another 20 minutes. No apology. Several others came in after me and they said the same thing about their order being delayed..so they need to work on the accuracy of their wait time!\n- they have drinks on their menu but they don't do to go orders for them :("

But sushi is what they serve up here and they do it well.\n\nTheir drink menu is extensive and is served in a large mug. Two people can probably share a drink here. They use lactaid milk (most Asians are lactose intolerant) and black sugar in their drinks instead of processed white sugar. Black sugar contains molasses, potassium, iron, calcium. Healthier than white sugar.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\nTakoyaki - Octopus balls\nSushi Burger\nTaiwanese Beef Noodle Soup\nTonkotsu Ramen\n\nMy kiddo had so much fun diving into the Sushi Burger. It was a little messy to eat but they provide you with a sharp knife and fork. The buns are made of sushi rice. It's a pretty good size burger.\n\nYes, this is more of a sushi restaurant and today we didn't order any, lol. We always love their food presentation, very pretty and everything is very tasty.

As someone who usually gets less sweet/no sugar for most of their bubble tea orders, I would recommend asking them to make it less sweet.\u00a0\n\n- [Spicy Garlic Edamame*]: Edamame already tastes pretty decent in its plain, original, salt-only form but adding garlic and sriracha\u00a0really elevates it. This is the first time I ever tried this flavor combination and I would highly recommend it.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- [Takoyaki*]: At some point, all the takoyaki I've ever eaten tastes the same but I like takoyaki so I would still recommend it\n\n- [3 Piece Salmon Taco]: I'm on the fence if I would recommend ordering this because the first couple bites are really good; the flavors and textures go well together but at some point it gets a little heavy from all the things that are in it and messy from all the liquid.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n- [Sushi and Sashimi Platter for 2]: Unfortunately, when\u00a0I ordered this, the fish wasn't fresh so the sashimi and nigiri were especially hard to eat. I was disappointed because the presentation was so beautiful. The saving grace was the chef special roll. Hopefully it's one of the regular rolls you can order from their menu because it was absolutely divine.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nWould I go back? : If I were to choose, this place wouldn't be my top choice of restaurants. For a place that mainly sells sushi and bubble tea, I thought the two were mediocre. What I do like about this place is the unique items on their menu. Other reviewers have mentioned their sushi burger and I thought their salmon taco was unique. Overall, I would\u00a0give this place 3.5 stars. I lean more towards the 3 star rather than the 4 star because each item I ordered was a hit or a miss rather than being consistently good."

I got there in 30 min and they said it would be a few minutes extra wait. It was almost 20 more minutes, meaning my order took a total of 50 min ish. They also had the order sitting on the table for a bit before realizing it was mine. When I got home, I realized the food lid was barely on and coulda slipped off. Yikes Z the cucumber and eel roll also had barely anything in it. everything else was okay. It's basically a coin flip for bubble fish- sometimes it's good sometimes ehh.

Love the atmosphere. Very modern but still get the feeling that it is family owned. \n\n2. Food was delicious!!!! The menu is on the narrower side compared to other sushi restaurants but all of the rolls we ordered were very unique and tasty. \nAlso they offer weekly specials that you cannot find on their regular online menu. These included more cooked options and speciality rolls. (My mom doesn't eat sushi so this was a big +)\n\n3. Price to quality ratio was through the roof! High quality sushi for the low. \n\nWould recommend trying the Tuna Princess & Marilyn Monroll"

However, I think there was a miscommunication with the waiters and once figured out, it was great service.\n\nWe started with the takoyaki which is much better in the restaurant vs. delivery. We also had edamame which was slightly undercooked and had a little too much salt.\n\nThe star of our meal was the sushi rolls. We tried their signature rolls which were HUGE. Definitely pricy, but it was difficult to finish because of how much they give you. We ordered the Bubblefish Roll, Angry Dragon Roll, Marilyn Monroll and Mars Roll. The Marilyn Monroll and Mars Roll were my favorites! The Mars Roll is so pretty and has gold flakes on it!

It's a TALL glass of dreamy, creamy mango smoothie with mango chunks and yogurt popping boba. I get this everytime I'm here. \n\nThe worst part of going to bubblefish is the service. Be prepared to wait at least 30-45 min for your food, and for parts of your order to be missing. Not sure what's going on in the kitchen, because even when I just come with one person, the food still arrives like 30 min later. I've been here around 5 times, and 2 of the 5 times they've mixed up my order or forgotten part of the order entirely.

However let me be clear, if you want to hang out at a cool trendy place with some friends in Chinatown and order some fancy milk tea drinks, this is definitely a strong contender.\n\nHowever my wife and I visited for the food. So firstly there were no soda offerings here. It was tap water or fancy tea drinks only. I'm a tap water kind of guy but my wife is a Coca Cola fiend, so while it doesn't impact my review heavily, I did want to throw out that disclaimer. They were also cool about letting me hop over to 7-11 and grab my darling wife a bottle of her favorite fizzy drink. Kudos to the staff for being flexible.\n\nThat said, I'm kinda sure that Trump didn't initiate a tariff on spicy peppers or spicy Sriacha mayo, but if there is one let's hope that this summit in Singapore resolves this issue and restores the term spicy at an Asian restaurant to its rightful place.\n\nI ordered a spicy Tuna/Salmon roll and really it wasn't spicy at all. I was surprised that the heat was lower than the standard sriacha mayo you'd get at the local Poke joint.\n\nI also had some salted Taiwanese chicken. This dish is one of their appetizers. I enjoyed it, despite it being mostly darker meat, and at $6.00 you get an entire pot of chicken. My disappointment here was asking for some sort of spicy dipping sauce, and being told ok, only to find out that at the completion of my meal none was furnished.\n\nSo for anyone looking for spice or a special kind of accommodation (a sauce), my recommendation would be to set the expectations for what you need ahead of time and follow up as the food/beverages make their way out piece by piece. \n\nThe cool thing about this place is that they'll serve you the food as soon as it's ready in no particular order. I liked that."
