The price is completely fair and the food was authentic! Also, they allowed us to BYOB which is always a great find in the city! We're happy we live so close and will definitely go back"

I got the veggie omelette and my husband got the huevos rancheros- both served with rice and beans. The staff was so nice! The decor is a bit odd but somehow it fits! It's bright with good vibes. Great addition to the neighborhood! Legit Mexican food- huge menu with tacos, quesadillas, burritos and more- fair prices and friendly staff. Check it out neighbors! And- thanks for the breakfast Cocina Cafe!"

The quesadillas and tacos are also delicious and the people running the place a super friendly, offering great service including delivery. A must try!"

Alex, the waiter, was extremely friendly and the food was outstanding. I had the mole enchiladas and they were absolutely delicious. I already have plans to come back! Do yourself a favor and come eat at this new restaurant."

Didn't even think about it once! Everything about my meal was so well seasoned and delicious! \n\nPlace is super nice and cozy inside.\nFood came out really fast!\nThe burrito they brought to the guy in the other corner was huge! \nHe even outwardly commented on the size and then commented after how great it was! \nIf that guys glowing accolades for his burrito isn't enough for you to try this place out I don't know what is."

I had the steak quesadillas and they were way better than I could've imagined them being. The staff (owner?) was super attentive and food arrived quickly. Considering the size of the quesadillas I asked if it would be better to eat with my hands or silverware and wasn't put to shame but given an honest and clear answer. I can't wait to come back on a lunch date."

Affordable and came with fresh avocado and cucumber along with  a charred jalape\u00f1o and charred onion. The two salsas were tasty and had good heat. Their horchata was fresh and tasty.

Recently I got enchiladas that were some of the most authentic I have found in Philadelphia in a long time. \n\nIn addition their chefs were able to add some charred jalape\u00f1os to my dish. Couldn't have been more filling, delicious and warming during these chilly months!"

Their al pastor tacos were definitely unique and on point, in comparison to other taco places. Slight oil, but that's no big deal. Flavor was a 10+. We also got mango bubble tea and that fulfilled my cravings - it's an ice blended drink, not just a juice with ice cubes in it. Which is exactly what I love. Glad to be living just a block from this place! True blessing. It's currently takeout, but I'm so ready to try more food from them. I believe they often update their business things via Google business, something about their menu! I know recently they added teriyaki chicken and rice. I have heard they're Mexican, with a touch of Asian. I believe one of their management or owners are Chinese (she's the one who I've seen at my job) so that is really cool. Gotta support good food places!"

It was hilarious we were dying laughing. Also the coffee was no bueno. Would go back for actual Mexican food maybe but def skip breakfast here. Service was great though!"

The place is not pricey at all and food is generally ready quick.  I've never dined in but the place looks very clean every time i have gone to pick up my food. Had a bad experience with a shrimp quesadilla one time (it was just a few pieces of shrimp and cheese). But other than that, everything else has been fabulous. i Recommend any of the burritos!"

I had some of their special tacos and I have to say that they were not excepcional. Maybe you should just go with other popular choices like Al Pastor. The orchata (drink) and chips were great. The prices are affordable and the quality of the service is also very good."

She also got the green tea boba drink and she loved it better than any other place we've tried. Customer service was on point too. They even offered us free delivery and we really appreciated it.
