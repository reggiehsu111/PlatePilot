Thankfully, they couldn't fit us in, so our son said lets try Angelina's  so we walked around the corner and into a small Italian Restaurant.  Immediatly we felt at home.  Angelina is cooking in the front of the resaurant and her husband is servicing. There were 3 of us and we started off with Eggplant and roasted pepper appetizer.  One bite and we were hooked.  We ordered the Veal Osso Bocca, Carbonara and lasagna.  Everything was absolutly DELISH!!  Can't wait to go back!!!"

While we sat there waiting for our meal we could see Angelina, the owner, cooking our food with fresh ingredients. The pasta was perfectly prepared and the sauce was absolutely delicious. We had a party of 16 to celebrate my daughter's graduation. The staff couldn't be nicer! I cannot wait to return to Angelina's."

The food was delicious - we had the Melanzane (eggplant parm) appetizer, as well as the Poleptta, which is basically a large meatball. The eggplant was huge, definitely enough to share. Same with the meatball, you only get one - but it's large. For the main course, I had the special of the night, which was fettucini, tomatoes, arugula, and shrimp mixed together with olive oil. Pretty basic, but delicious. My boyfriend had the gnocchi, which he also said was delicious.  Service was good, and the staff (basically one person) was super friendly and attentive. This spot is definitely worth checking out!"

Angelina, is in the kitchen by her self, servicing the orders (this can be seen through a window in dining room). I did not have the chance this time to sample the main courses, but the  pasta was beyond fresh as was the burrata we had as an app -- I can't wait to work my way through the menu."

Everything is made to order by one of the owners (Angelina?) in a small kitchen open to the dining area, which gives it such an intimate feel. Between the 4 of us we ordered 3 apps (burrata, octopus, meatballs), 3 pasta dishes (carbonara, gnocchi, rigatoni), and an entree (veal) and not a single dish disappointed. Honestly I had no idea a meatball could taste so good! The family that owns it is incredibly sweet and really cares about putting out the best food possible--even if that means a smaller restaurant. This is my new go to and I can't wait to go back!"

This intimate cash-only BYOB restaurant looks like it occupies a former single-family home. There are only a few tables, and it is a small operation. I live in the neighborhood and when I walk by, I often see Angela herself in the small kitchen through the window on 8th Street. And that's how your food is prepared: carefully and thoughtfully by Angela, maybe with some help from her daughter. Angelina's is not inexpensive, but it's an affordable indulgence offering excellent quality (and service) for the price, which isn't true of many restaurants in Center City. My family enjoyed the salad, salmon, eggplant, spaghetti special, and tiramisu. That homemade tiramisu is incredible and generously portioned: one serving is plenty for two people. The only downside is that options are limited for vegetarians like me, but I realize that this follows traditional Italian cuisine. Our server was lovely and attentive, and he deserves an award for chasing us down the block after dinner with the prescription sunglasses we left behind."

If you are interested in beautiful furnishings and waiters in tuxedos, this is not your place. You will enjoy a full view of the wonderful food being prepared in the very clean kitchen as there is a large opening in the wall that separates the dining area from the kitchen. They have a BYOB policy which is always a good thing and the service is very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. The food is what you come here for and it's the food that separates Angelina's from dozens of other Italian restaurants that can only dream of preparing & serving Italian food like this! Everything the 9 of us ate was great including the bread, Insulata Formaggi, Melanzane, Burrata, Polipo all Grilglia, Carpaccio Classico for appetizers and the Gnocci, Spaghetti all Carbonara, Pollo Angelina, Ossobuco, Braciola with meatballs & sausage for main courses. Each dish was prepared perfectly. For dessert, we shared the Tiramisu & the Ricotta Cheesecake and both were excellent. This was our first time dining @ Angelina's and we will definitely return on our next trip to Philly! Make sure you make a reservation! When we arrived, there was a long line of folks who didn't on the sidewalk waiting to get in."

My one cousin refuses to eat Italian food \"out\", as her mother lives with her and no restaurant meal has ever come close to her mom's cooking. Suffice it to say, she loved it. We all did. Everything was exquisite. Service was great and prices are more than reasonable. BYOB is a plus, as it is far more economical. Make reservations...there are only a few tables. And don't forget to bring cash, they do not take credit cards. We have already made another reservation for when we visit Philly again  in a couple of weeks (we live in Florida but visit our family in Philadelphia often, and we plan to bring them all here!)."

If you have not been to Angelina's, it is a very small restaurant that is very simply decorated and you really need to make a reservation to avoid waiting on the line that forms on the sidewalk! Also, it's cash only. There is an opening in the wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area so you can watch the food being prepared and, it is a BYOB which is an added bonus!  The menu is not extensive but there are many wonderful selections to choose from. Everything we've had during our two visits was excellent from the pastas to the burrata and mozzarella, the eggplant and the shrimp with broccoli di rabe & chic peas. Angelina's is a very special restaurant!"

Also, the gnocchi is as soft as a down pillow. We finished our delicious meal off with 2 espressos and a perfectly sized slice of homemade Italian cheesecake. We were out the door in time to catch our show. I live about an hour away but I'm already plotting my next trip to Angelina' s. It's that good. If I lived close by I'd be there every week as prices are very reasonable for the quality of food served! I can't wait to visit again and see what else they have on special as well as order different things from the menu that we couldn't fit all into 1 dinner.

The menu is a compact offering of apps, pastas and entrees, all dishes you have seen 1000's of times. The differences are apparent as the food is served-obviously only the finest ingredients are used and the balance of flavors is just perfect. The kitchen is open so you can watch the mother/daughter team prepare plates. How could spaghetti and meatballs taste so ridiculously amazing? You have to come here to find out! It's byo which we do love. \nService was attentive and good. The room is small so it can get noisy depending on the crowd. I'm glad we don't live closer cause this place could be addicting."

We ordered for the octopus, bolagnase, osso bucco, and carbonara. Both the octopus and bolangnase were bland and tasteless. The carbonara was the best dish and still was not good. It was not fresh pasta, was still fairly bland, and there was not much panchetta in the dish. The osso bucco was dry and needed seasoning as well, and then had the pleasure of finding a hair in the dish. The server took it away, came back and tried to tell me it was from a vegetable..... seriously, a vegetable?  I was still charged for it on the bill. I won't be going back ever again."

The tiny dining room shimmered with the delight of those few of us crammed in for dinner. It's a Mom and Pop and Grandpop restaurant, with grandson wiping down tables if he's done with his homework. The homemade pastas are fabulous -- silky pasta, rich sauces.  The veal chop was SUBLIME.  We heard them pounding it in the kitchen (which is basically in the dining room) and then we heard it frying and oh, the smell ... then of course the juicy delicious perfection of eating it.

I've had amazing Italian food at other places in Philadelphia and New York City, and unfortunately, as much as the staff here were wonderful, the food was just not over the top. The tomato sauce didn't have much taste to it, the octopus appetizer had zero taste to it, and the gnocchi was very rich but nothing special. Also I found it odd that there were only two choices on the dessert menu, Ricota cheese cake snd tiramisu.

For dinner, I had the veal chop which came with a salad of arugula and tomatoes, which cut the savoriness of the veal chop perfectly. We shared a dish of carbonara for the table. I wasn't in a pasta mood, but it was wonderful. We split two desserts - the bomba and the semifreddo. Everything was wonderful!"
