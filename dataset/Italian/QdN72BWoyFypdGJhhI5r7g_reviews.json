I love how creative everything was.\nI CANT STOP DAYDREAMING ABOUT THE FOOD. Hands down, best brunch experience of my life. I don't even like french toast usually and theres was by far the most delicious food thats ever entered my mouth. I am literally drooling while writing this.\nThe chicken and waffles were unreal and standout A++++. \nI love the \"flinstones pushup-pop\" drink so creative and clever.\nEven the deviled eggs were the best I've personally ever had. They do everything right even when it comes to the music. It was super fun and such a great experience! Ignore any review thats not 4 stars because they must be delusional."

Let's start with the Tiramisu french toast. Now, I'm not one to order from the sweeter side of breakfast, but these were basically screaming at me from the menu. These little slices of heaven came out fast (which I always appreciate) and were DELICIOUS. My other friend ordered the CANNOLI PANCAKES. UNREAL - no surprise there. Aside from the incredible food, the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. The overall vibe of this place was just so upbeat and really set a great tone for the rest of my day in Philly. Can't wait to go back!"

Food rundown: Mussels in a French onion soup broth, 10/10. Tiramisu French toast, 10/10. Marinated fried chicken and waffles 10/10. But one of my faves has got to be the avocado toast, a perfect ten. To die for. My recommendation is to go out for brunch with some friends and split all of this deliciousness. You won't regret it. Oh and also, the staff knows what's up."

We were skeptical at first, but the drinks on the cocktail menu were fantastic and they had some decent local beers too. My boyfriend tried the old fashioned and the banana Jameson (Jameson soaked in banana and brown sugar!) and I tried the flinstones push pop and the spiked hot chocolate. The flinstones push pop had a scoop of berry sorbet, prosecco, and I believe a lavender liquor. It surprisingly wasn't too sweet and will definitely be a summertime favorite. The spiked hot chocolate was made from belgian chocolate and had a giant toasted marshmallow on top. It was honestly the best hot chocolate I have ever had and I definitely couldn't stop myself from slurping it down too fast! The old fashioned was pretty good too, and we definitely loved the banana Jameson. For the Irish whiskey lover it's a must try!

This made the final bill shocking as I didn't expect a PBC bottle to cost $8.99+. The tap list was illegible from the tables and the waiter suggested I go look at it to see what was on it. My flatbread came out over cooked and cold. Our waiter, while he tried and was nice, wasn't very knowledgeable about the food or beer.\n\n2.5 stars overall.

I've been here twice, not during peak bar hours so I'm sure it's even more fun at night, but both times I've been I left wishing it was closer to where I live. \n\nThe first I came here was for a quick drink to kill time before my reservation at Ralph's (which owns this bar).  The bartender was super informative, even giving us tips on what to order at Ralph's since it was my first time there as well, and the drink I had was delish. \n\nThe second I went was this past Sunday for some food after bike riding. It was still brunch hours-I got the eggs benedict, my boyfriend got their special cheesesteak omelette, and we split the sausage and pepper spring rolls.  First off sausage and peppers is one of my very favorite foods so to see them offered in a unique way was really cool and they were really good. My eggs benedict was good too, but my boyfriends cheesesteak omelette, topped with their homemade wiz sauce, was beyond.  Both brunch entrees were served with spicy potatoes on the side which were tasty too. We had a different bartender this time and he was just as friendly and helpful as the one we had the first time. \n\nI've been here twice and I can't wait to go again."

The service was impeccable.  The wait staff were so attentive, my glass was never empty.  We all had these delicious \"Flintstones push pop\" drinks , you must get one!  It is a mimosa with a scoop of sorbet, the ideal brunch drink to wash down all of the great food.  \n\nThe food was to die for.  The pickle back wings & waffles dish was my favorite.  The marinade and seasoning of the chicken is one of a kind, combined with the sweetness of the waffles, HELLO flavor explosion!  The avocado toast was also tops. Avocado, egg and Texas toast...perfection.  Another stand out was the Tiramisu French Toast, this is what actual dreams are made of.\n\nI loved the overall ambiance of Bar One.  The art in the restaurant (and in the bathrooms) are really cool.  I wanted to take home one of the pieces hanging in the ladies room!  The music they were playing was awesome, everything from 90s alternative hits to Jay-Z.\n\nThank you Bar One for an amazing experience!!"

Decent discounts on drinks, and a fairly varied food menu for happy hour, too.  Was here on a Tuesday, and was impressed by the solid crowd that came in for trivia, as well."

We got 2 apps and 2 entrees to split: pesto deviled eggs, Italian spring rolls, cavatelli, and the spicy chicken cutlet sandwich. Would skip the spring rolls (they kind of tasted like taquitos) but everything else was delicious! Cavatelli was the favorite for sure"

        "text": "My girlfriend & I stopped in here one night before our reservation at Ralph's. We had an hour before dinner and decided to sit and have a drink here. Oddly enough, we checked their reviews and decided to give it a try. We got to talking with the bartender and she informed us that Ralph's owned Bar One. We glanced at the menu while we had our drinks and both agreed that we had to come back here. \n\nFast forward a few months and we ended up back at Bar One for brunch. It was around 12:30 when we got there and I believe their brunch is 11-2:30 Then the kitchen closes for an hour and they start dinner at 3:30 PM. My girlfriend got Eggs Benedict that she really enjoyed. I ended up getting the cheesesteak omelette with their special wiz sauce on top. I didn't ask how they made their sauce but I suspect it's a mixture of wiz cheese and heavy cream; it was to die for. The entire meal was phenomenal. Their menu is also very eccentric which, as a foodie, I really enjoy. \n\nThe staff is very friendly and informative. They also have a lot of drink specials. If you love Bloody Mary's you'll love it there. \n\nThey seem to be a new bar so I wanted to make sure I gave them a good review to help spread the word. I definitely recommend Bar One and I'll be back."

        "text": "This was my first and definitely last time. I would not recommend. I was being generous to give it 2 stars the only good thing is that it was clean. The waitress was very slow and inpatient. She was unprofessional in sharing her feelings about my disappointment to her co worker!!. I said that my wings were not done. They were hot wings and the skin was soft and wet as if it was not cooked hard enough it was still light no color besides the sauce. In addition, the other 2 orders that were brought out at the same time had the same complaint from 2 other tables. She frowned up her face and said a thermometer was stuck in them and they are done. When she took them back ,it took another hour before the new ones were brought\n The lamb burger was seasoned great but had toooo much salt. To top it off, the pasta had a peice if hair in it. We did not complain or say another word. We just packed up and left"

        "text": "I've been on a search for a good, under $20, pasta option for a little while. Bar One isn't it.\n\n     Let's start with what it is, though. Can you go have a beer with your friends, and watch a little of the game? Yes, you definitely can. Do they have a beer list which comparable to other crafty, Philly spots? Yes, definitely. Is it crazy expensive, or crazy crowded? Nope...it's ostensibly a neighborhood bar.\n\n     By no stretch of the imagination is it an Italian restaurant. Frankly, I'm not sure why Bar One even bothers to pretend it is such...perhaps the neighborhood, or proximity to the market...but at any rate, fine Italian cuisine it is not. Excited to try a new spot, stopped in on a brisk Friday in November and, ordered the cavatelli with Gorgonzola sauce and sausage. The most notable issue was that there was no sausage. Strike one. I could not identify the flavor of Gorgonzola in the pale grey sauce either. Let it be know that I love blue cheese, and a little goes a long way with said ingredient; it's a strong flavor. This, however, tasted more like a bland rue. The pasta itself was stuck together in clumps, which made me wonder how it was prepared...pasta doesn't do that in a saut\u00e9 pan.  It was thoroughly underwhelming. \n\n    It's also worth mentioning the staff...or at least one bartender.  My gent was fine. He seemed to have a little trouble getting around, but was courteous enough, and managed my order with no issues. There was another, much ruder, gent who spent the evening - or at least the time that I was there - trying to recruit customers into belittling the other bartender (the one serving me). \"Can you believe he has a degree in music?!?!...in MUSIC?\", he asked me with his absurd Thomas Shelby haircut and manicured beard. \"Who does that?!?\", he continued in his effort to impress himself. I absolutely did not take the bait; nor did most of the other customers, in what I can only expect was everyone trying to extend common kindness to a man just trying to do his job. \n\n     Let's have a reality check here. 1. Publicly belittling others lacks both character and professionalism. Full stop. 2. I have a degree in music, and what has been (so far, thanks be to God) a lasting & rewarding career in the Arts. So, what was meant only as unnecessary posturing between staff members, deeply offended your clientele. I chose not to engage the argument, because that is in no way what I'm looking for in a dinning experience...an argument with an arrogant, yet poorly-informed bartender. The phrase \"service industry\" springs to mind...SERVICE...since we like to repeat ourselves. In conclusion, the food was edible but not good; yet it was the utter pretension of Mr. Shelby which will ensure that I will neither spend another singular dollar, nor recommend Bar One to any of my friends or readers. #Service"

I was able to try their chicken and waffle, buffalo chicken pasta, lamb slider, and pork and Buffalo chicken spring rolls. They were all fabulous. The food is really amazing here. Think Bar food with a classy twist. They had live music (one guy with a guitar playing covers) which had a good vibe setting the mood all night. Their draught beer list comprises mainly of local craft brews. They had 4 big screen TVs showing the sports game. This is a new age neighborhood bar that I will definitely come back to. Definitely glad to see a new bar at this corner."

        "text": "My mother and I went to the Italian Festival last Saturday, as I work in the area. There was plenty of food, family, music, and vendors. \n\nI wanted to try a new place with great food and service. As always, I read the reviews and pick my spots. So attempting to visit Bar One was not out of the ordinary. Well, as we walked through the festival, we saw a young lady passing out flyers to everyone. To my surprise, as when we got closer, she looked us in our faces, and turned around...mine you, there was no other individuals close to her to pass out the flyers, then us. At this point, I replied that maybe the business that she was representing had an exclusion policy. At that point, an older gentleman standing near her, heard the remark, apologized, and passed us a flyer. \n\nTo my surprise, the flyer was from Bar One! At that point, we continued to walk to the end of the festival, and I was still interested in visiting Bar One. After reaching the end of the festival, we turned around and began to walk back. As we neared the Bar One vicinity, another gentleman was now passing out the flyers. As we approached closer to go near the front of the Bar One, the gentleman did not look at us to give a flyer to either. It was obvious that this second time within a 45 minute span was NOT an accident. We simply didn't fit the identity of their clientele. Point taken."

        "text": "I understand Bar One's attempts to change the traditional Italian food into bar food but a lot of it didn't make sense. \n\nThe Good - Let me say that I would RUN back for the french onion soup mussels, they were absolutely delicious and full of flavor. My favorite part were the french fries at the bottom of the bowl that were soaked with the french onion broth. \n\nThe service! Each waiter was extremely attentive and nice, never had to ask for anything as it was already taken care for me.\n\nThe drinks were delicious as well! would come to drink rather than eat. \n\nThe bad - the kale calamari salad. The calamari to salad ratio was way off, less calamari, more lettuce. The calamari it self was over salted and heavily coated. \n\nThe Mafaldine pasta - was WAYYY under cooked, I like my pasta al dente but this was still raw. Also the pasta is way too large to have small pieces of shrimp and asparagus with. Again, this dish was over salted. \n\nIn all, I would come back if improvements were made. I want to see this restaurant do well! Great location, and the place is cool."
