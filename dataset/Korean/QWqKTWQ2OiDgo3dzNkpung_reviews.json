Very welcoming, warm and inviting.\n\nIt's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. \n\nYou can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.\n\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  \n\nIf you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.\n\nLove this place!!!"

I wasn't a fan of any of the apps except for the korean pancake. The kimchi and side dishes I thought were pretty fair. The soft tofu there I thought was pretty good especially for $10. But on top of that the level of spiciness you can request is awesome! The protein in the soft tofu I think are lacking and it's very subtle. You'd forget what you had ordered because their would be only one or two pieces. \n\nThe atmosphere: 5/5 \nThe interior design of the restaurant is fantastic. It gave a more authentic korean dining experience. \n\nThe tofu house is a cute establishment and a great quiet spot to take a date or a small group of friends out to. I have gone back multiple times and enjoyed myself each time."

If you like soup, do not miss this place.\n\nFor under $10 a bowl, served with piping hot rice and pan chan (small side dishes the Koreans serve with most meals) it is an amazing value. My wife and I order two bowls and take home half of one most times. For $25 including tip you can have a dinner unrivaled anywhere. Plus this place is BYOB with no corkage fee.\n\nThe atmosphere here is quite sophisticated. The restaurant is decorated with primitive Korean farm implements -- most look like they belong in a museum. It is quite beautiful, yet very relaxed.

Moving away from a place where all kinds of Asian food, including Korean food, were so easily accessible, I never expected to be 10 minutes away from such a heart warming meal! Hot steamy tofu soup...I love you so much! \n\nThe soup itself is very flavorful; one of my friends from home even thought it was better than what we could find in California! Per usual, the assortment of banchan was equally gratifying. Spicy kimchi, pickled cucumbers, bean sprout salad, pickled daikon, seaweed salad, oh my! I love it all. I've also tried their Japchae on two occasions. While I'd still order it again, its slightly too oily for my taste but I'll take what I can get in the Philly suburbs!\n\nI do wish their parking lot was bigger or maybe better structured but that won't stop me from coming back.

Shortly after you're seated, you'll be brought hot tea or barley water (depending on the weather) and shortly after that they'll bring out several small dishes full of delicious things to munch on while you wait for the food you ordered.  I would recommend getting the soft tofu soup, which comes out boiling in a cauldron.  It also comes with a cauldron of white rice.  The best part is eating the rice that gets crispy along the sides of the dish that it comes out in.  The soup is so good that as soon as I'm not stuffed after eating it, I want more.

I have a friend that has to go once a week to get his Soondubu (soft tofu soup) fix on.\n\nThe place is famous for its soon dubu, and soon dubu is one of my favorite Korean dishes that does not involve meat. They give you alot of choices for what to put in the stew, I almost always get everything which is: Tofu, Beef, Shrimp, Clam, Oyster.  The stew is very very hot when it comes out and you have to put the raw egg in when it first comes out. The taste is indescribable because it is good.   They give you a choice of how spicy you want it, I always get the very spicy.  The side dishes (ban chan) is always good and they give you alot.  Also if you want a appetizer I would recommend the BBQ squid which is marinated in gochujang (korean chili paste) it gives it a sweet and spicy kick and also the hae mool pajun (seafood korean pancake).  I also love at the end how you can put the tea into your rice bowl and get a the crispy rice since the rice is served in a hot clay pot.  \n\nJust writing this review has made me hungry and wanting me to go back to eat their soon dubu.

Tofu comes to you in a stone pot and as for the quality, it is definitely probably the best I've had in Philly. Tofu is soft, soup is adequately flavored, and temperature of the soup is sufficient for all intents and purposes. The LA Galbi meat was also something that was ordered and I will say that the meat here is pretty good. Marinated well, not undercooked or overcooked, and pretty tasty. As there is a dearth of Korean places around Philly, prices here tend to be higher than what is normally expected so do keep that in mind were you to come here.

Holy frijoles batman, what a delicious fiery exotic blend of complex layered flavors with a bit of sweetness - my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  \n\nWhen they brought us each a giant stone bowl of rice I thought, \"yea like I will eat this huge bowl of rice\" - well guess what, I did and wished I had more, the way the rice gets crispy in the bowl is sooo good.\n\nSome side dishes were yummy; most notably the marinated tofu & peppers, spicy zucchini and some kind of smoky bean sprouts, others less so.  \n\nWe had a sort of embarrassing oops.  We had ordered the mushroom Soon Du Bu and I whined until hubby rolled his eyes and agreed to order it with a spiciness of only \"3\" (there have been waaaay too many times we ordered things in Asian restaurants \"very spicy\" that ended up being inedible to me, I mean, I like spicy but not \"oh my gawd my mouth is on fire, my tongue is numb, my eyeballs are blood red\" spicy like him!).  \n\nBut when we got the dish I reluctantly agreed we should have gotten it spicier.   Somehow they picked up our body language and asked what was wrong - we told them we wished we had gotten it hotter.  Thirty seconds later a woman came bustling over and indicated she could make it hotter for us and we happily nodded yes.  We waited and waited for it to come back, wondering what was taking so long - surely they just had to throw a few more spices in?  The dish came back no spicier but it was scalding hot - all I can imagine is some overworked chef in the back being asked to heat up even hotter a dish that had already been served to us literally still boiling - eep!\n\nWhen the bill came - $23 for a groaning table full of tea and food - we almost felt guilty - so much goodness for so little money."

The first owner did an amazing job and this restaurant was famous in the Korean community - everyone who loved soon dubu knew this place was their go-to. However, owners changed somewhere along the way and the quality of the soondubu went down drastically. The flavors changed, there was less tofu, less seafood in the haemul soon dubu, and the somethin flavor was off.\n\nLast year I gave it another try on a cold day and I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant was really good again! They put in the right amount of spice (4 out of 5), it was a bit sparse on the seafood again, but plenty of tofu. I went a few more times after that, and the last couple visits I noticed the quality go down again.\n\nI just went again with my [Korean] parents and was so disappointed that I don't think I will be coming here again for awhile. My dad got the clam soon dubu (level 2 spice) and it was ALRIGHT but maybe because it wasn't spicy. My mom ordered the doenjang soon dubu and it was just salty. There was no flavor and no substance I thought I was tasting super concentrated ocean water with soft tofu. My mom couldn't take more than 2 spoons because of how ridiculously salty the was. I ordered the haemul soondubu as usual (level 4 spice), and the seafood was sparse masked by a ton of tofu while the flavor was also a little off. Also, due to kitchen renovations the rice was not served in dolsot (stone pots) which was a huge part of my soon dubu experience.\n\nTo top off the decrease in quality of the food, we asked [multiple times] for plastic containers to bring home the leftovers but was told that those containers were only for take out customers. Instead, we were given these small foam containers that were could easily get crushed. We asked for one more plastic bag just to pack our leftovers separately but they insisted on only one bag per customer even though there were 3 people with 3 separate orders. Clearly the economy is hitting them hard and the quality of food and customer service is sinking with it."

But each tofu soup is 10 dollars disregard which kind you get, is a little expensive ( but Korean food is always overpriced in my opinion). It's not located in best part of the city but its worth the drive. The people here are nice, but they can't understand English well. One incident happened was there was a fight between two tables but the owner didn't take care of it and everyone of the staff was just standing to watch the two tables arguing back and forth. I didn't like that but the food was good."

The decoration is simple and classic. The place feels cool inside in term of temperature because it is build slightly below the ground level. And the food is perfect for winter time, because it will make you sweat!\n\nThe food is amazing here if you order their soft tofu. It comes with the tofu soup, rice and side dishes, which are amazing. (Don't be shy to ask for more if you want more kimchi, cucumber or bean spout).  I've tried pretty much all the different soft tofu on the menu. I recommend ordering soft tofu and nothing else, because on the flip side menu, there is not much to order. The food is just ok and quite pricey. If I have to recommend, I would say the bibimbap in hot stone pot.  Everything else is not really worth it, although I have friends who really dig the BBQ squid. Also if you order soft tofu, the spiciness is important, you have to at least go number 2 in term of spiciness or the soft tofu won't taste as good. One of my favorite is the mushroom soft tofu."

But Korean was always down towards the bottom of my list of things that are yummy. Until this place. For real. I am now converted to the church of Korean flavors. Here's the story.\n\nSo I'm feeling terrible one night, really really terrible. I've got a stuffed up nose, I'm super hungry, I'm bloated and its that girly time of the month. And the only thing I want in the whole wide world is just a nice big bowl of warm spicy soup. So I go onto Yelp, and I check out my bookmarks for saved places in my hood. I speed-read a few reviews for this place and convince my husband we need to go here ASAP. \n\nAnd like Audrey Horne, I get what I want.\n\nI ordered the mushroom soft tofu (beo seot soon du bu) and my husband ordered spicy chicken & vegetable (dak gal bi). Both medium spice and both so freaking amazing. My soup is spicy, it's comforting, its downright perfect. It was exactly what I was looking for.\n\nBut before your food is ready, they bring out 5 different banchan: Kimchi, marinated bean sprouts, spicy cucumber slices, adzuki beans, burdock and jalapenos (I think) marinated in sesame oil and soy sauce? Not sure, but they were all tasty. But the best part is they bring you some weirdly awesome hot tea that I can't get enough of. I haven't figured out if it's Boricha (barley tea) or Hyeonmicha (rice tea). So weird and soooo good.\n\nPreventing a few faux pas:\n1) That egg they give you is raw, and it's meant to go in your soup.\n2) The weird little box attached to your table? That's a call button for the staff.\n3) Don't be dumb. That soup is boiling in there, so DON'T touch the caldron-bowl. Use the plate underneath.\n4) Do you mix some of the pitcher of tea with your leftover crispy rice or not? I still haven't figured that one out.\n5) This place is totally not for kids. Delicate wall hangings? Boiling hot stoneware? A call button on the table to play with? A raw egg just sitting there, waiting to be used as a weapon? Yeah. Not for kids, but perfect for us adults."

Most of the menu is variations of their specialty dish, a soup/stew called sun du bu.  It's got a red broth and lots of tofu as well some meat or something else, depending on the variety you order.  The soup is literally boiling when it arrives at your table, and depending on how you order it, it's pretty hot in the other way, also.  You are provided with a raw egg to crack into the soup if you wish.  You also get a pot of rice, a variety of tiny side dishes and a drink that I understand is essentially iced tea made with buckwheat instead of tea.\n\nMy three companions and I really enjoyed this place.  The one problem we had was that one of our friends is a strict vegetarian and it was difficult for us to determine which things on the menu were truly vegetarian, partly because of the limited English of the servers.  She doesn't want meatless soup if it is made with beef broth, for example. It was pretty clear that we weren't going to be able to communicate that to our waitress, so she got the pancake with scallions.  \n\nI'll be back, especially on a cold day!"

It always comes with a giant bowl of hot rice and a raw egg for you to put in the boiling tofu when you first get it.\n\nThe bonchon dishes here are numerous, you usually get a set of 6 for two persons, if you have 4 people you should get two sets of 6 bonchon side dishes.\n\nTheir other dishes are consistently good also.  I love the pa jeon (korean pancake) with scallions and squid.\n\nThe service is fast paced and more leaned towards \"asian\" style of service, meaning you shouldn't be shy to ask for things if someone doesn't fill your water or tea. They have a special little button that dings for service when you press it.\n\nThe tofu dishes are $10, with leftovers if you have a normal appetite, but a hungry person can probably finish a tofu themselves.\n\nParking is free in the lot in the front of the restaurant, although it can get tight at times, I recommend backing your car into the spot if possible."

        "text": "BEST FIND EVERR\n\nAt least for me and my Korean food cravings :) I'd contend that it's one of the best places for Korean food in Philadelphia, but there's a lot more to this restaurant that makes it definitely deserving of 5-stars!\n\nFor starters, I say it's the best \"find\" ever because it is a good distance north of the city and you'd probably need to drive there. Since I don't have a car, I would never have known about it if it hadn't been for friends who HIGHLY recommended it (for good reason, I discovered!). However, they do have a parking lot, so at least that's off your list of worries. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is spacious and pristine, giving off a casual ambiance with a touch of traditional Korean elements. Hence, it can accommodate small groups fairly easily. For example, on my first visit, I think I came with a group of 6-7 and we all fit comfortably around a table, and could have probably seated just as many more on the adjacent table.\n\nAnd now, the menu! As the name of the establishment suggests, its specialty is the soft tofu (soon doo boo) and it is SUCH a great deal at $10 for their different kinds! Kimchi soft tofu, seafood soft tofu, clam soft tofu, beef soft tofu, etc... yum! And they do it legit too - providing you with a raw egg that you crack into the stone pot of hot soup. Oh, and before I forget to mention, you can also adjust the level of spiciness when you order (if you don't specify, they will just give you the average spicy level, I believe). If you're not in the mood for soon doo boo, they do have other Korean food options on the menu. Admittedly, I typically gravitate immediately to the soft tofu whenever I visit, but I've tried the dak galbi once, which was also delicious and fairly generous in its portions.\n\nSpeaking of portion sizes, the restaurant is famous for their amazing side dishes that they refill if you ask when you finish (can't imagine how many plates they have to wash!). With the side dishes and the rice that comes with your main meal, it's a lot of food in my opinion. So basically, go hungry :)\n\nAnd a final adorable touch is that they typically give you a little mint candy with the check, which gives the feast the proper conclusion that it deserves. Definitely a meal worth every cent in my book!"

The soup is made and eaten right in the serving bowl, which is typically made of solid stone. Served with a raw egg to be cracked into the soup. It comes out still bubbling vigorously. You are also given a bowl of cooked white rice and several banchan (side dishes). The banchan are so addicting that you'll ask for seconds! A true Korean meal is never complete without banchan. And the ones here are crazy delicious. Also highly recommend their bbq meats. \n\nI worship this eatery greatly. You might as well stop reading this review and ask me about it in person. Because chances are that if you go here now, I will be there eating my sundubu and banchan!"

It come out super hot and bubbling. The tofu here is really soft and tender. I always get the seafood version and have never Veblen disappointed. They have so many great sides here also. The Jambi and spicy grilled squid are also a great choice. Super tiny parking lot though that has a hill going out."

You wouldn't expect this much looking at it from the outside, but the packed lot and lack of parking nearby clues you in on just how much people love this place.\nI am new to Korean food, and as the other reviewers have stated, the food is great. The menu is a little bit small, but what the menu lacks in size, the foods make up for in flavor. We ordered tofu soups- mushroom and kimchi. I experienced more flavors and spices in that meal than I have at all other restaurants combined in the past 2 years. The only thing I was not a big fan of was the drink, I believe it was barley water.\nThe dining experience itself was something to be remembered. The service was something new, we didn't know that it was a bell on our table we were supposed to ring, so we waited for a table near us to finish so we could see how they worked out getting the check lol. Cracking a raw egg into the soup? Really? Surprisingly yummy. Although my DH missed the bowl and sent his egg everywhere. Chopsticks for beans (one of the many yummy side dishes) was a fun challenge too.\nThe decor set the scene and it was just a really fun experience with great food."

I would suggest Googling and reading about the customs of soft tofu stew before going, just to eliminate those few moments of confusion. \n\nWe had a bowl of the seafood tofu stew, and one of the beef+kimchi. Both excellent! Level 4 was mighty spicy enough, and glad we did not go for 5. $10 for most selections ($12 for the most expensive) gets you a bowl of your choice of stew, rice, tea, and side dishes, and a raw egg to crack into your bowl. Your stew arrives still boiling. A giant, cheap, exciting , and satisfying meal!"

You don't get the full experience, and your dish will come out looking bleached white, instead of a healthy dark orange or red.  It's not to say that you need a mouth burning, sweat inducing heat, it's just that there's a lot of flavor in the spices- not just hot hot hot.\n\nNone of non-soondubu dishes are very good.  I've tried most of the things on the menu, and am disappointed every time (I end up ordering things again and again because newbies want to try things).\n\nGo there.  Eat.

Do you like soft tofu soup (In Korean it's called soondubu) cause you kind of owe it to yourself to come here. You can choose the spiciness of the dish from 5 different levels ranging from dull and flavorless to scratch your taste buds to get the spicy flavor out. Coming out of the kitchen in a stone bowl, the soup is boiling angry only satiated when you crack open the raw egg and pour it in like a sacrifice. I always get the mixed (seok oh) and they got everything I love in life in there: shrimp, clams, beef and more.

My dinner partner hit the \"bell\" on the table and it made a horribly loud noise, and had our server giggling at us - rightfully so, we were even laughing at ourselves.\n\nSo, if anyone here knows how you get the check at the end of the meal without making a scene like we did...let me know - because I will definitely be returning.

The first thing she said to us was in Mandarin \"Do you speak mandarin? are you chinese\". I felt weired, wouldnt it be awkward if im not? She didnt offer me a high chair. So when i asked for one, this other male server just grabbed the high chair from the table cross from us ( who just left). The high chair was soaking wet because the little girl on that table knocked the water cup and spilled on it accidentally, also not to mention all the rice and pieces of pork on the seatbelt and the corner of the seat. I had to clean their highchair and  put layers of clean diaper on it before i can seat my baby. At that point, im already not happy with the service.  We ordered soft tofu stew and a bibimbap. The stew was very nice and authetic, but the bibimbap was very hard and dry, barely edible. I dont like strangers to hold my baby, the male server just came up to my son while he was sitting in the high chair and asked my baby \"Can i hold you?\". My son is only few months old, what made him think it's ok to not ask me but ask my baby for permission? I just felt really uncomfortable staying for any longer time. We finished the tofu stew and quickily paid the bill. We left as soon as possible and will never come back again."

Be warned, the service may not be the best if you are non-Korean and/or are young. I suggest you look past all of this and just enjoy the food like I do. \n\nIn terms of what I like, Oyster is my favorite because they stand out in flavor but Pork is pretty good too. It's all up to your preferences as the base will taste mostly the same. For the spice level, they go from levels 1-5 and levels 4 & 5 are very spicy! Also the heat level is very hot when it comes out so put the egg in there (it's not a hard-boiled egg) and let it sit a few minutes before enjoying. \n\nOther than the Soondubu, they have some ancillary dishes to go along with the Banchan (small dishes). My group's go to is the LA Kalbi for extra protein to go with the stew. It's not the best and can be hit or miss but the stew is the main attraction anyway. I've also tried the Grilled Squid, which was underwhelming. I take one star off because these dishes aren't up to the standards of the stew.\n\nYou've been warned about the heat and spice.

For some reason I have the chopstick wrapper sitting right here on my desk.  That must mean it's good!\n\nSeriously though this Korean restaurant may be a trek outside of Center City (20 minute drive with no traffic), but well worth it if you are a fan of Korean food, especially Soon Doo Boo (otherwise known as Soft Tofu in a hotpot.  It's so popular that oftentimes finding a parking spot in their lot is impossible, but fret not since their is usually ample street parking.\n\nFor Philly, you can't get better than this if you want Korean food.  The menu selection is a little small, but if any of the reviews are an indication, get the soft tofu.  If you must eat something else though, they also serve the traditional Korean BBQ that everyone loves and forms of Bibimbab (rice dishes mixed with assorted vegetables, meat and egg).  The tofu will cost less than $10 and anything else will just be over $11.  No matter what you get though, you'll more than likely leave full.\n\nLike most Korean places, you also get a number of small side dishes right when you arrive to hold you over until the \"real\" food arrives.  In terms of the soft tofu, be wary that Korean restaurants tend to serve food on the spicy side, esp this soft tofu dish.  However for the weak in stomach (I myself am in this category despite my love of spicy food), you can order \"Little Spicy,\" which is the equivalent of mild.  Make sure you say \"Little Spicy\" too (or whatever it says on the bottom of the menu if you want another spice level) because though the service is great, many of the waitstaff speak limited English.  They have no idea what \"mild\" means and will keep waiting for some English they understand like  \"Little Spicy.\"  (I may sound like I'm joking, but I'm serious - went through this twice in my many visits).  Another thing typical of true Korean restaurants, realize that they do not serve you clear spring water by default but instead often give you some sort of iced tea (I think it's Barley Tea).  If you want regular water though, just ask for it instead of telling them their water is dirty cuz it's not.\n\nDespite the limited English, they know more than enough and also try to explain dishes on their menu so you can more than get by.  Service here is great!  They try to check up on you and always attempt to serve their food as fast as they can.  Of course if you ever need help, they offer a little button on the edge of every table so that you can \"ring\" the waitstaff.  Once you push it, a little doorbell sounds and the waitstaff know to come to YOUR table.  Can't get better than service on demand!\n\nIn terms of decor, the place is modest, but well decorated with Korean antiques and cultural items.  It definitely feels like Korea town versus Center City.  The only con of this setup is that they like wood way too much with the entire place constructed of it.  This means the seats which are rock hard and always far away from the table.  You have to sit on the edge of your butt if you sit in the booth.  It kills your Gluteus maximus but to be honest once you get over it, you won't even realize it, especially one the food comes rolling in.\n\nIn summary -\nPROS - Philly Korean at its best, best soft tofu in the area, fast service, good and efficient waitstaff, constant food, very affordable, nice atmosphere, family friendly\n\nCONS - location is a little far and requires a car, limited English spoken by waitstaff, hard weird wooden seats"

I love how rustic it is. The seating may not be the most comfortable because it's bench-like but it's very spacious. The menu is very limited compare to other Korean restaurants but i don't really mind for the fact that they do it right with the dishes they offer. I usually order the BBQ chicken and the soft tofu mushroom soup. I think I've tried almost all their soups but i always manage to go back to the simple mushroom one. It's so delicious, from the broth to the soft tofu and aroma of the shitake mushroom. The added bonus to ordering the soup would be the level of spiciness that you can choose from. I always go with medium because the \"more spicy\" is really overwhelming after a few spoonfuls and it's kind of hard to enjoy the true flavor of the broth when your month is burning."

Father had the ssam. Very good. The birthday girl shared with me. You didn't think I could eat all of the above (see 2nd sentence) and have room for the delicious bonchon, too? Did you? No room for the nooroongji so we took it home with us. Looking forward to having some of that later! Wish I had some of their kkong cha to wash it down."

Also make note that they do not take reservations and the place gets pretty crowded most nights, especially weekends. Lastly, I don't think they are big fans of honoring their BYOB policy. Brought a couple bottles of wine and soju on my last visit, but it took a few reminders and a lot of patience to get a wine opener. Then the opener was brought out, but no glasses. Then we got glasses for the wine, but not the soju. By the time we had everything we needed, most of us had finished up our meals. So we didn't even open the bottles. I would've even accepted little two ounce Dixie cups, but 'no dice'.\n\nWith that out of the way... the food is/was amazing. The hot pot dishes and soft tofu are very good. The sides are great to nibble on while you wait and add some nice flavors to your meal. Make sure to get a scallion pancake, or two... or eight. The prices are very reasonable and the quantity more than adequate. If they tighten up their service and get more efficient with their table seating, I would gladly bump this place up to 5 stars."

And I ordered the dak tori tang which was $17.oo and my wife ordered the stone bowl bibimbap which was $15.00 and the side of kalbi which was pricey at $20.oo. However when we got out food I was impressed! The portion of Kalbi was great and it was delicious! Could have fed 3-4 people big thick glistening pieces of kalbi. The entrees were both delicious and my wife thought it was one of the best bibimbap she's had with lots of fresh ingredients and good amount of meat. The only thing I was not impressed with was the banchans which I though were kind of bland and mostly veggies and small amount of kimchee. It would be nice to have some potato salad or some small fish. However that will not deter me from coming again.

Oh and did I mention its BYOB?\nIt's great in the winter because it really warms you up.\n\nYou can order soft tofu stew/soup with beef, seafood, mushrooms, kimchi and pork, or you can mix all of them into one! They come in a variety of spicyness ranging from plain to so-spicy-that-the-stew-is-purple (careful of this one because it'll come out the way it looked when it went in). They come out in these clay pots and are still bubbling when it's brought to your table (this is the perfect time to drop in that raw egg they give you!). You also get a stone pot full of white rice to accompany the soup/stew. The korean side dishes are tasty too! The spicy cucumber really settles the hot temperature of the tofu soup. For the non tofu eaters, this place will make you into a tofu eater! If not, there's a few other dishes like Glass noodles, Korean short ribs and seafood pancakes, which are all tasty but not their specialty. Service is quick and if it's not attentive enough, there's a little call button (sounds like a door bell) on each table. There's a parking lot which, when packed is a pain.

They even use the same dishware as my favorite KBBQ restaurant back home! \n\nWe all ordered the Sundubu Kimchi and got the BBQ Squid and Bulgogi to share. \n\nAs for the banchan, the pickled cucumbers and daikon w/ soy sauce and jalapenos were definitely a favorite amongst our group while the kimchi left something to be desired. There was a sweetness to it that I am not used to... It also was not as spicy as the kimchi I usually eat. \n\nOur Sundubu arrived bubbling and boiling in their stone cauldrons accompanied by the rice also in a stone bowl. I immediately cracked an egg into mine and ladled the soup over top. (I like to let my egg poach in there to get a nice eggy surprise halfway through my meal!) One of my fellow diners chose to scramble the egg into her sundubu. Though apprehensive at first, she was sure glad she did it!\n\nThe bulgogi was great as was the BBQ squid, both dishes massive in size, the four of us were stuffed to the brim by the end of our meal.\n\nIn general I could have used a lot more spice in the meal, we ordered our sundubu medium because again, at home usually medium is a decent spice level. I was disappointed at how mild my sundubu was... next time we will definitely order \"Spicy\". That in addition to the odd kimchi is were the -1 star comes from. Oh well. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed my meal here and will be back again soon!!\n\nOh and PS:\nIt is a BYOB, and definitely good for a cheap date!"

My mother took me here as a birthday surprise a few years ago, because she wanted to \"do something different\" I wasn't very excited when we drove 30 minutes from Doylestown to this kind of sus looking building....And then we sat down, in a nearly empty restaurant that vaguely reminded me of my grandparents' Byzantine church. I was being a brat.\n\nWe fumbled our way through the menu, and when the scallion pancake came out, all of my previous observations were erased. It was amazing. I'm not sure what the proper way to eat it is, but we went for all the toppings on the table. Quickly after, the main course came out. I like plain soft tofu with spicy. I've been back a handful of times since then. I even went there with my boyfriend on Valentines Day. This is how much I love Soft Tofu. Please try it."

I happened to be driving through the area, so I decided to stop by for lunch. The place had a few diners, but I was also early for lunch. There is ample parking in the lot on the side. I ordered the seafood pancake and the beef (very spicy) soondubu. Delicious!!!! It was a lot of food, but I really wanted to try them both. The seafood pancake was good. I enjoyed the sauce it comes with it more.. cause I tend to like a more crispier bite. The soondubu was just perfect how I like it. Usually order very spicy and it never is that spicy, but this was spicy! The banchan is your typical, but the bean sprouts stood out for me and had an enjoyable flavoring. \n\nGreat place! Highly recommend!!"

We couldn't tell the difference in spice levels, though both were nicely spicy.\n\nWhy four stars?  This place is good, but overhyped.  Run of the mill banchan and good but not amazing soon dubu.

All of the staff were so friendly and welcoming of me and my toddler (not a common occurrence at most restaurants). He is very outgoing and sometimes surprises strangers with hugs. Did that today, and they just ate him up! All of the other staff asked for a hug too.\n\nThe kimchee jeggae hit the spot, and even my 3 year old (very picky) son enjoyed it! The small plates were nice, all pickled-ish, I usually like the egg one and the pastry one, but they were still tasty. \n\nThe best part, for those who have young children, was the end. I needed to take my son into the restaurant before we left because he is potty training and, for that, hourly consistency is key. This is a frightful endeavor when out running errands; one never knows what they will encounter in a public restaurant, and it is usually not a pleasant experience.\nThis was. The bathroom was SPOTLESS, and smelled nice! (Nice bonus for a pregnant lady) But the best part: inside the stall was a small table that has a training seat on it! How thoughtful. Usually my son needs to prop himself up with his hands on the large seat, which makes me cringe every time. Not today! This is what I call kid friendly. Also, the bathroom has a changing table for the babies, which is in my experience uncommon amongst non-chain restaurants.\n\nThis place has great food and caters to the needs of moms with young kids. Wonderful experience, we will definitely return!"

        "text": "If I had to review this place on the soon du bu alone, this would be 5 stars. I'm not soft tofu expert, but I've tried a few other places and this place is the best I could find. You can choose from 5 different level of spicyness - from not spicy at all to really spicy. I stopped getting very spicy because it got to the point where it was so spicy I couldn't taste it no more. Each order is served with a raw egg for you to cook in your piping hot bowl and a stone bowl of rice. \n\nNot quite of a fan of their other dishes though and that's mainly why it's not 5 stars. Just a couple pointers on other food items:\n- Most of their small dishes are good - especially the cucumbers! Those are my favorite!\n- BBQ Squid is a good choice as well - grilled squid no significant taste or marinade\n- Seafood pancake could be better if it was more crispy\n- Galbi is cooked well and not burnt or anything but something about their marinade doesn't wow my taste buds\n\nI like the interior for this place because it has a traditional feel to it. Service is usually pretty good, but when it gets busy it might be kind of hard to get some attention. Have no worries though, each table should have a service button for you to press if you need something. Also, parking can be a problem in their small lot (especially towards the front near the railings) when it's busy. If you have a problem with the lot, you can always park in the street. My last parting advice is to avoid the so called \"dessert gum\" that comes with the check! I don't know anyone that likes it.. probably because it taste like those mint toothpicks that you can find at some restaurants."

With the rice, and the stew, and the sides (panchan), this place definitely fills me up every time I come here.  \n\nThere are 5 spice levels for the stew, with 3 being a medium.  Beware if you're not used to Korean spicy foods, as it can indeed get pretty hot.\n\nThe service is okay, but not great.

The building  looked intriguing and full of secrets.   No windows and the words \" SOFT TOFU  RESTAURANT\".   My initial response was \"Ugh!\" a whole restaurant devoted to  tofu???!!!    Something  lingered in my head each time I passed by the lone building.  I   asked around and I read the other reviews about this place on YELP.  Finally, a few weeks ago I made the journey during rush hour to Jong Ka Jib with a friend. Upon going inside, the decor  resembled  a slightly medieval restaurant with low booths and masks on the walls.   This restaurant caters mostly to Koreans  which, to me  is a great sign.   I was determined to get the tofu soup/stew.   We ordered the seafood tofu soup/ stew and the spicy  chicken stir fry dish ( because another Yelper loved it).   Before the  dishes came,  8 tiny little plastic dishes  filled with various pickled  vegetables, kimchee, sauteed spinach  etc  were brought to us.   We  received huge  black foot stoneware bowls filled with rice and plastic  pitchers filled with water.   I had no idea what the hot water was for until I asked  a couple at the next table.    The water  helps scrapes off the last layer of rice  that  is glued onto the bowl like a barnacle.  This final layer of crispy  rice is \"prized\".  It is  crunchy and wonderful.  We took home left overs and had another  meal.   So  both dishes with 2 colas was $23  and fed two hungry people  two meals.     A REAL BARGAIN!  \n\nThis past week, I attempted to make my own Korean tofu stew.  It cost me  almost 3 times    for the ingredients and it  sucked ( I found the recipe online).   I will be  going  back to Jong Ka Jib  in the future.    Wonderful!"

I finally got the opportunity to go when one of my Philadelphia-native friends took me here last night. I don't have a lot to compare this restaurant, but I can say I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner experience. I only wish there was a similar restaurant in Center City.\n\nWhen you walk in, it is decorated to look like an authentic Korean restaurant. We got a table in the area with booths. Each table has a little doorbell ringer that rings to alert the waitstaff you need service. We ordered the Seok Eo Soon Du Bu (beef with seafood), Hae Mool Soon Du Bu, seafood pancake, and kalbi. All dishes are served with hot tea (we couldn't figure out it if was brown rice tea or not) but it was very tasty with a mild, pleasant flavor and light greenish color. Perfect on a cold, windy night such as last night. The banchan dishes we were served included kimchi, spicy jalepeno pickled radish, picked cucumber with red pepper flakes, seaweed, bean sprouts, and individual dishes of more pickled vegetables. The seafood pancake was light and fluffy with scallion and squid. Both soon du bu dishes were amazing. They even serve you a raw egg to poach and stir into the soup. The rice for the soon du bu comes in a hot stone pot so that the rice will develop that crunchy crust. I tasted both soon du bu dishes we ordered and was surprised to find broth of the two soups had detectably different flavors. I always thought that the same soup base was used for all soon du bu dishes. We both ordered them with a spice level of 3, which was just enough for us to detect a spice but not spicy enough for our preferences. Next time I'll try 4. The kalbi was good as well, but nothing to write home about. This place is definitely worth trying if you love soft tofu. The parking lot they offer is key since you'll most likely be driving there."

Not too hot... my friend and I usually spend about 1 hr to 2hrs there... we eat slow and we like to chat... perfect comfort food for that.. \n\nAt first when the soft tofu comes out it may not look as much... but trust me its very filling... and it doesnt make you tired afterwards.. which is awesome for me\n\nTheir side dishes are yummmmmy! Im very picky when im eating kimchi... and the kimchi there is really good\n\nThe staff... honestly someone them seem miserable.. but they dont take it out on you, so I didnt care lol.. usually we are seated right away.. I love the uniform they wear.. and the decor is beautiful.. its very homey lol... youll understand when you check this place out! \n\nI love this place and deff recommend this place for anyone who's looking for amazing soon du bu.... or boo?

That is hard to do.  I tried to make it at home but not the same.  They are the best Soon Du Bu place.\n\nIf you cannot handle spicy Soon Du Bu, I would recommend Danjang (soybean) Soon Du Bu non-spicy.  That is what I order for my little kids.  They love it!"

My favorite is the combination soondubu with spiciness level 2. The stews here can get very spicy so I would tread cautiously if it's your first time. The side dishes are always hit or miss depending on your own taste preferences, offerings from sour to bland to spicy. Very affordable, no fuss korean comfort food."

I'll simply make what I hope are some useful observations: \n\n-They do not have yukgaejang (which might be my favorite food EVER), and they do not serve kimbap. Other than that, most well-known Korean dishes are served here and are excellent.\n\n-The BBQ squid is not for beginners. It's a HUGE Jacques Cousteau-looking mofo, and when I've ordered it, the server brought a set of culinary shears (scissors you normally use to quarter livestock - not typically a table utensil). I've ordered it a few times, but it's not their best dish.\n\n-The place is BYOB, but they don't seem to have glassware - just those plastic cups like you'd get at a Pizza Hut. If you care about what you drink your wine or beer out of, then bring your own glasses.\n\nJust writing about this place makes me want a bowl of seafood jigae and a kimchi pancake. \n\nGo. Eat.

You will smile when the bill comes. \n\nThe soft tofu stew is incredible -- definitely the best in town.  The ambience is okay.  the seats are noticeably uncomfortable and the service can be a little spotty.  \n\nThe usual spread of side dishes is a bit spare in comparison to most places, but it seems fitting with theme of economy.  The sides themselves are not the best, but much appreciated.  \n\nIt is a BYO, though the vibe of the place is pretty non-alcoholic, so there are times you might be the only person/table partaking in some cocktails.  Probably not ideal for a large and loud crowd, though there is definitely enough seating for big groups and usually not much of a wait. \n\nJust the basics, no frills, but top notch for what it is."

You can control your spice level by ranking 1-10, 1 being least spicy, 10 most spicy.  I recommend ordering their seafood pancake as well to complement your Soon Do Bu if you are eating among a group of friend(s).  They usually allow you to refill their panchan (free side dishes) once or twice before being difficult about it.\n\nFor the rice given to you in the stone bowl, I recommend pouring the hot water they give you in a pitcher, into the stone bowl, once you have eaten most of it. This easily allows you to scrape off the crusted/hardened rice on the sides of the bowl.\n\nParking can be difficult when their lot is near full as it is weirdly laid out.  If you are having difficulty, street parking nearby should be ok although area does not seem the most safe.\n\nOtherwise, pretty good Soon Do Bu, esp. on a cold, rainy, or snowy day!"

Prices going up.  4.5 stars.\n\nI'm fairly certain I order the same set of things every time I go here, most often with my lovely S.O. and some friends so there's always too much food.  One order of mixed seafood and beef tofu soup (most spicy), one mushroom tofu soup (medium or more spicy), BBQ pork (or squid every so often), seafood pancake.  The tofu soup is really flavorful and comes with rice served in an iron? bowl.  This cooks the edges of the rice to a nice crispy texture that is fun to dip in the leftover soup.  Most spicy means your soup comes out pretty red and it does have a bit of heat but nothing too heavy.  Also, all tofu bowls are served with a raw egg for additional flavor.  The seafood pancake is large and really well filled with squid and shrimp.  Side sauce is pretty standard but this dish is very enjoyable.  BBQ pork comes with scissors to cut it up and is never disappointing.  The price of most everything has been going up over the past few years which is disappointing but still not a deterrent to coming back about once a month.  You do get a bunch of free mini plates depending on how much food you order.  Kimchi, seaweed, bean sprouts, etc. are served up cold and tasty.\n\nI really wish Yelp allowed for 1/2 stars.  This would be a 5 if I didn't watch the prices go up steadily over the past 4 years.  The food is still great and it's not expensive but tofu and a little meat/seafood in stock probably shouldn't cost $10 =)  \n\nTasty tofu bowls.  Free stuff.  Nice service.  Do it.  Cheers."

They're flexible about the ingredients-- I love to combine mushroom AND beef (though it is not on the menu). In my opinion, medium spicy is comfortable and flavorful. Spicy feels like a cumulative heat that, by the end of the meal, is slightly unpleasant for me (nose running, sweating, etc).

I love coming here during the winter to warm my belly with a nice, bubbling bowl of homemade tofu soup. But since the food is so good, I come here all year round!\n\nMy favorite soondubu is the beef, in medium spicy. My mom likes to order it in little spicy so she can taste more of the tofu flavor. The wait isn't long, and time passes quickly when you're tasting the different banchans. My favorites are the spicy cucumber and kongjang (soybean). Once your rice and tofu soup arrive, crack your egg into the boiling soup and let it cook inside. Soon du bu is only $10, and the portion is big. I usually finish half of it and take the rest home. \n\nI've also tried the gal bi (beef short ribs) and seafood pancake. Both are a hit or miss. Sometimes the gal bi are grilled perfectly, while other times they're overcooked and dry. I like my seafood pancake crispy, but when it's a full house, the pancakes come out a little under-cooked. For the price, it could have a little bit more seafood in it too. But that doesn't stop me from ordering it as an appetizer each time :).\n\nThe restaurant has a very nice, calm atmosphere.

Los Angeles) to Philly a few months ago, I've tried over a few dozen Korean restaurants and I've been fairly disappointed in every single one of them. All of them had ok to terrible tasting Korean food and they were all overpriced for the quality that they served. I was about to give up on all Korean food in the East Coast and write it up as a hopeless endeavor.\n\nAnd that all changed when I came here.\n\nI was told about Jong Ka Jib by a friend who knew I was looking for good soon doo bu and how I'd been so disappointed in all of the Korean places around the area. I honestly didn't think this place would be any different but I was thinking, \"Hey, at this point, I might as well start conditioning my mind into thinking this is good Korean food.\" and I went.\n\nI was blown away. Not only is Jong Ka Jib the best Korean food I've had at a restaurant since moving out from LA, but I would definitely consider it one of the top ten soon doo bu places I've ever been to in my life. Granted, it's not in the top 3 in my opinion but it's definitely up there. I had the pork soon doo bu extra spicy and ordered a side of kalbi ($15). The soup base was very tasty and it wasn't too watery or thick. And the tofu was cooked to perfection. They give out perfect portions too so after you finish eating, you should be pretty full.\n\nDon't be surprised or put-off when you come in and see a ton of non-Koreans eating here (white and Chinese) if you're not used to that. I myself, coming from LA, if I went to a Korean place and saw the customer base were mostly non-Koreans, I walked out because from experience, the food did not taste like Korean food but very Americanized. This place doesn't follow that trend.\n\nThe service here is just ok, or maybe even below ok but that's what I've come to expect and experience when I was in LA going to good Korean restaurants. It's rare to find a Korean place that has great service and great food. The galbi was terrible though. Don't get it. First off, it's not marinated very well and the flavors come across a bit funky. Second, it is way overpriced for the amount and quality of the meat. I shared the kalbi with two other people and we didn't even finish the galbi. That's how bad it was. As long as you stick with the soondoobu, and the occasional pajun (Korean pancake), you'll be very happy.\n\nAfter my oh so amazing experience here, I came here two more time thinking maybe it was a fluke. And no, it wasn't. I think I've found my home here.\n\nParking: Limited lot or street\nPrice: $10 per person\nWait: 10 mins after order (during rush hour you will wait an hour to be seated so beware)"

When we asked him for another one, he gave us the dirtiest reaction and then 2 minutes later brought out the same stew but with just water added to it.

Seeing all of the other rave reviews makes me want to head back and see if the Sunday when we dined was just a rare fluke. I feel like we were jipped out of this amazing experience everyone else had. We were so excited to treat my parents to this meal. We were a tad embarrassed about how it turned out....\n\nRight off the bat, ordering was fairly difficult. They did not speak one word of English. Many mistakes were made and any special requests we had were unable to be fulfilled because of the language barrier. We spoke with two individuals, neither understood us. At all. I think that unfortunately set the tone for the meal. \n\nWe had a larger party and below is what everyone had to say. I personally can only comment on the mushroom tofu soup which I actually really loved and am totally craving right now after looking over my photos. The scallion pancakes were a tad soggy and lacking in flavor for me and the dumplings were just ok. I've had better. A tad too slippery and slimy for my taste. The plain rice was so delicious for some reason. Piping hot. Yum. \n\n3 yelps Beef soup. Not enough beef. Banchan Sides were good. Ribs were good. Chicken was just alright. \n\n3 yelps seafood tofu soup just two shrimp (one with eyeballs) Barely any seafood. \"Floating yuck\". Beef was really good. Chicken was just ok. \"$12 for a bowl of tofu?\"  Dumplings were good. A little mushy. \n\n2 yelps they don't have anything for kids. \n\n4 yelps Excellent rice plains and simple. \n\n3 yelps mushroom tofu soup was very good. Beef was the best out of everything.

The atmosphere inside is nice, and compared to some other Korean restaurants / tofu houses in the area, it's not too expensive ($12 for soondubu, around $14-20 for other dishes). The broth is delicious and they give you plenty of rice in a stone bowl on the side. The amount of tofu they give you a plenty as well - I've definitely tasted better tofu, but their soondubu always satisfies my Korean soup cravings."

I love that they serve rice on the hot stone bowl as well.  I happen to weirdly like the crunchy rice on the edge of the bowl.  The squid along with the rice is filling enough for me.  We also tried the soft tofu seafood.  It sadly did not have much seafood.  It included about 1 piece of each: oyster, shrimp, mussel.  The flavor of the broth was delicious but the contents of seafood was lacking.  The tofu was tasty as well.  The buy had the bbq rib and the devoured it to the bones.  No complaints.  I just wish this place was closer to home.  It's definitely the best korean i've had for a while."

I have been going to this place for years. \n\nI love spicy food and tofu so when you mix it together, it is like my special comfort food. For $10 (excluding tip +tax) you get their soondubu or soft tofu, about 6 side dishes, and a bowl of rice. \n\nThere are a variety of soondubus you can get an all of them taste great but they do taste similar. Maybe it because they use a basic method to cook all of them with subtle ingredient changes.\n\nI wont lie but they seem to skimp on the ingredients. Especially on the seafood. The mussels and the clams they put in the soondubu is as small as your pinky nail. And the squid in the korean pancake is a joke. It so small that you can't taste it. \n\nThis place gets quite busy and never have I once feel rushed to finish my food. The servers, however, always seem so rushed and busy when it is busy hour but this feeling is never transferred to the customer.\n\nDespite some flaws, I do enjoy this place and will continue to go."

I came here for lunch and the prices were decent for the weekend. I got the beef soft tofu, while my boyfriend got the kalbi. Our friends also got some other tofus. You are able to say how much spice level you want for the tofu (the spiciest one is not too spicy according to my Korean friend!), and each entree also comes with a huge bowl of rice even though it does not say it on the menu. \n\nThey had a good variety of banchan, as I loved the pickled cucumbers, radish and kimchi. They definitely give a lot of tofu and ingredients inside it, as I had a lot of tofu leftover and less soup. It tastes amazing, perfect for a cold day! There was also a good amount of kalbi, and they come uncut, but provide scissors for you to cut them however you want. The flavor and tenderness of the meat was perfect. \n\nA great place to try if you are in Philly, but the location is outside of the city skirts so it is only accessible if you have a car!"

I love tofu and Korean food, and after reading the good Yelp reviews, I knew it was a place I had to check out especially now with Miga in downtown Philly being closed.  \n\nThe decor is all wooden and what I assume is old traditional Korean style.  We were seated immediately and given menus.  In less than a minute we were brought a pitcher of water and the waiter was ready to take our order.  However, I wasn't that familiar with the menu, so we weren't ready yet.  I decided on the pa-jun (Korean pancake), that I seem to order at every Korean restaurant I go to because I like it so much, and an order of the vegetarian mushroom soft tofu stew.  The waiter asked us if we were sure we didn't want seafood and not the vegetarian pajun.  I will eat seafood, but I'm not too fond of the octopus and squid that usually end up in Korean food.  I told him I preferred the vegetable one.\n\nAbout 6 Banchan (Korean side dishes) were brought out including:  Kimchi, beansprout salad, seaweed salad, and a few other things that I'm not sure exactly what they were.  They were okay, but I've had better at other places. We were also brought a raw egg, which I assumed was for our stew.   Our food came out within five minutes, and then the waiter was never to be seen again until we flagged him down for a check.  \n\nThe pajun was okay, but only had scallions in it.  At other restaurants when I order the vegetarian one, other veggies like kimchi, peppers, mushrooms, or carrots are usually included as well, so that was a bit disappointing.  The tofu stew was good and boiling hot in temperature and spice, but I didn't think it was superior to ones at other restaurants.  I did like the rice in the stone bowl, but it was really hard to get it off the sides and no one came around and poured the warm water/tea in our stone bowl at the end of the meal like others had written about.  We also were not instructed what to do with the egg (I wasn't sure if it was for the rice in the stone bowl or the stew), and the server dropped off the food so quickly and ran off that I couldn't even ask.  I wasn't getting any 3G on my phone, so I couldn't check back here on Yelp, so I guessed and put it in the stew.  It tasted good though.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the low price.  We only paid a little over $20 for the whole meal for the two of us and we left feeling full.  I would go back if I was in the area for the stew again, but I don't think I'm going to drive out of the way for it since the service was a little lackluster and I can get similar dishes at other places."

And I am very happy to say that it did not disappoint.\n\nSoft Tofu (or \"soon dubu\" in Korean) is a traditional Korean dish that is, for some mysterious reason, very difficult to recreate at home. It has soft tofu (as the name suggests) which is much much silkier in texture than any tofu you'll see in non-Korean markets (even silkier than the tofu that's termed \"very soft\"...which is called \"yeon dubu\").\n\nJong Ka Jib specializes in this \"soon dubu\" dish. You get a hot sizzling stone pot full of stew consisting of hearty broth and soft tofu. There are various kinds of ingredients (seafood, pork, beef, mushrooms, kimchi, or everything-combo) you can choose to put in and varying degrees of spiciness. If you are unsure of the choices, I get the combo and medium spiciness (3 stars?).\n\nAlong with the stew, you get side dishes (\"ban chan\"), typical of Korean cuisine, and you also get rice prepared in stone pot (so that rice near the stone gets crispy). The rice, after eating the soft part, you can pour the barley tea they provide into the pot to loosen the toasted rice (called \"noo roong ji\").\n\nIf you are familiar with similar joints in NYC or LA, like Book Chang Dong (or shortened as \"B.C.D\"), you will find that the soon dubu at Jong Ka Jib is just as good what you will find in B.C.D."

All the Soondubus are a flat $10 and come in various spicy levels - none, little, medium, more, or very.  I started off at little, and over the past 10 years, made my way to more spicy.  It can be inconsistent at times, so I would suggest erring on the lower spice level if starting out.\n\nThe bonchon (side dishes) are good here, but there isn't a large variety. I haven't seen fish cakes or squid in a looong time - maybe they are no longer offered.\n\nThe soup themselves comes out in a stone bowl, piping hot. So be careful. And the soup is also served with a side of rice, also in a stone bowl.   They are also served with a raw egg - so make sure you crack it into your soup while it's bubbling!\n\nThe service is direct - take your order, serve your order, clean up.  Don't expect a chatty server.  But you can chat amongst your friends over drinks, because this place is BYOB.\n\nThe pahjong (seafood pancake) and dol sot (rice bowl) are also very good here, but it's impossible to try all that food in one visit.

A plain menu with soft tofu and various additions - clams, shrimp, beef, etc.  Their are other dishes that will satisfy those who don't like tofu and are along for the company.  There is now a small vegetarian section.  But the only thing of real interest is the soft tofu, which comes in a secret recipe stock at five levels of spiciness.  If you are a super hot chili fan, go for the five.  If you tend not to like things too hot, stay with one or two.  After that it gets decidedly spicy.  You will get a stone crock with the tofu, broth and a few morsels of whatever you ordered along with the tofu.  You will also get a raw egg to cook in the still bubbling tofu and stock and you will get another crock with white rice that is likely to be toasty brown around the edges.  Some people put their tea in that crock to soften the rice.  I like pealing off the rice to get the crunch.  You will also get a bowl within which you can mix the tofu stew and the rice, but I like to eat them separately.  There is no wrong way to do it, both Korean and American customers are too busy with their own culinary bliss to worry about what you are doing.\n\nThis is an update review and I still give it five stars.  It is a destination restaurant with authentic Korean wooden tables and benches, perfectly cooked soft tofu and rice in remarkable stone crocks and an otherwise competent, but unremarkable menu.  The prices keep going up, all the way to $10.00 a pop, which is more than the $8.00 per meal for soft tofu that was the rule 2 years ago.  But it is still a bargain destination for a fascinating culinary experience.  Something I've learned from someone even more enamored by this place than I is that when you want service you don't wave your hand or catch the eye of the waiter like you would at an American restaurant.  Instead, you ring the bell that is conveniently located at each table.  Just press the button and a little ding dong sounds and the waiter immediately comes to find out what you want.  All the service complaints in previous reviews should be discounted because it's Korean rules here, as authentic as the soft tofu itself."

It comes out piping hot and once you crack a raw egg into it and stir it a few times - you're in soon dubu bliss.\n\nTheir menu is pretty limited (they do have some Korean barbecue dishes, like bulgogi and kalbi), but I wouldn't order anything else other than soon dubu anyway. Banchan is average - their cucumber kimchi is bomb though! For $10 per soon dubu with free banchan, rice and no tax, you're in for a pretty sweet deal."

I've had BCD and Seoul Garden in NY and So Gong Dong in Palisades Park, NJ. \n\nLike all soft tofu/Korean restaurants, you get side dishes (banchan) but the pickled dishes here are great. For $10, you get sides, rice in a stone pot, and soon doo boo (soft tofu) in a stone pot as well. \n\nI usually get the \"More Spicy\" when I go, and for some reason, this level is spicier when I go with fellow Asians than non-Asians (judging..maybe?). This just might be me, though. I really would get some level of spicyness because the non-spicy soup is just meh and looks too pale. \n\nThe table bell to grab waiters are a plus, too.\n\nWish this place was in the city."

I've tried everything here from their BBQ, to appetizers, and of course, the soft tofu soup.\n\nMy go to order is normally the spicy pork stir fry. The pork has a nice kick and not too much fat on it. I do wish they used less onions and peppers, but that's because I'm not a big fan of those veggies. \n\nScallion pancake is decent. I'm not a big fan of scallions, but my wife seems to love this dish and orders it at most Korean places to try and find the best.\n\nSoon du bu - I always only eat this from my wife (she shares). The broth is extremely flavorful and if you ask for spicy, prepare for spicy! My favorite would definitely be the beef one.\n\nBonchon dishes - ehhhh - very limited. I normally only eat maybe the kimchee and maybe one other. \n\nFish cakes - greasy, but good. My son loves it!\n\nOverall - I know I will be back.

When pressed, a small chime is heard and a server will come and see what you want.  I don't usually curse in my reviews, but I fucking love this.  Everyone should do this everywhere.  Yes, I understand that a good server should be checking up on you to make sure you have everything at regular intervals, but what if my demands don't come at regular intervals?  What if my demand involves getting a paper towel quickly because my nose is runny due to consumption of really spicy food?  What then hotshot?  Wait until my server checks on me at the regular interval or hit the button that brings him or her over more quickly?  I don't even have to make eye contact or wave.  Bam.  Button.  Technology improves everything.  I always say that efficiency is the most important human emotion and this feature appeals to that emotion greatly.\n\nSoft tofu really kicks ass.  It basically boils down to tofu soup in a spicy broth with tofu, meat, kimchee, or whatever else you want in it.  I had the opportunity to try seafood soft tofu and beef/kimchee soft tofu.  I loved both but if I went back, I'd have to edge towards the beef/kimchee slightly above the seafood.  This may have to do with the fact that pulling the prawn's head and skin off with my fingers was stressful because the prawn was very hot when I was doing this.  I have very little patience when it comes to food and I frequently burn myself if things are served very hot because I have NO SELF CONTROL when it comes to something delicious.  The best example of this is my habit of ordering iced coffee beverages, not because I really like it cold but because I want to prevent myself from burning myself...This topic applies to Jong Ka Jib Soft Tofu Restaurant because the soup is served at an extremely high temperature and I decided to use my tongue to cool off each glorious spoonful.\n\nThis place is awesome.  The price makes it double awesome.  The food makes it triple awesome.  The unique nature of the restaurant and server buttons make it quadruple awesome.\n\nGet your soft tofu super spicy.\n\nOn the action-movie-parallel-satisfaction-scale, this establishment is my image of how great The Expendables should be.

I'm not a fan of soon dubu, but maybe it was a combination of the cold weather and the excitement of getting to eat real Korean food for once because Jong Ka Jib was truly just as good if not better than some of the places I've been to in LA's Koreatown. \n\nThree of us ordered soon dubu and I ordered the kalbi plate. It came out on the sizzling platter, and even though I was super upset by the portion size (read: small), it was decently marinated. You get kinda desperate when you don't have access to one of your favorite things to eat. But Jong Ka Jib is really known for its soondubu, so if you stick to the tofu soup, you won't be disappointed. The rest of the (limited) menu offerings are decent, but certainly not the best. You can't be great at everything right? The panchan (side dishes) are very traditional and pretty well-done, including the kimchi which was fermented to the right degree (in my opinion.) \n\nI love the ambiance - it is like a real old school Korean restaurant complete with wooden (picnic-ish) tables, stone pot rice bowls, metal chopsticks, and ahjimas (older Korean ladies) who are pretty attentive. And if they just don't seem to catch you trying to get their attention, then you have the button on the side of the table that calls them over. Yay for technology. \n\nDon't be alarmed by the waiter/waitress pouring warm water/tea into your stone pot at the end of the meal - it's like instant rice porridge. \n\nEven though it's pretty inaccessible from Center City without a car, it is seriously worth a trip. So make friends with someone who has a car, and nudge nudge them over to Jong Ka Jib. Your friend will most likely thank you."

Prices have gone up over the years which makes sense, but the quality has not stayed the same which is a shame."

Bul-go gi , gal bi, je-wo bokeum. Most was bland. And the flavors definitely had korean but also like a Latin twist that did not compliment it. Sorry didn't take pix of main dishes. Here are the sides we got instead."

All the tables are booths with benches which makes it look vert traditional. They use flat steel chopsticks which can be hard to use but they do have regular wooden disposable chopsticks.\n\nThere's a button on the table and they only come to you if you press it.. The waitress didn't know much English but she knew enough to understand me and she was super friendly.\n\nYou're served free mini apps while you wait for your food.. The apps can range but usually its Kimchi and pickled veggies.\n\nThey're known for their tofu stews which are great for the chilly weather or a cold.. I ordered the stew with beef and seafood. It comes boiling hot in a bowl and It comes with a raw egg that you crack to put in the stew. You can also pick what spice level you want. I also ordered the ribs which were good."

Your meal will be served with the traditional Korean side dishes like kimchi, salted bean sprouts, and pickled carrot slices to name a few. The soup/rice will come in a stone bowl that is made to keep your food hot the entire stay. \n\nThe beef short ribs are also great; highly recommend. \n\nParking is on premise and free!"

My usual order is beef soft tofu #2 spicy. Sad that the price went up for this place but I'll still return regardless. The workers are really fast and very polite. \n\nIm still searching for a spot that has fluffy steamed eggs though ;("

Ordered beef soondubu and seafood soondubu which both tasted great except it was missing the vegetables such as zucchini and enoki mushroom that I typically get from korean restaurants in other states not sure if this is typical in Philly. High quality of tufu which I will give credit. Would like more of other ingredients."

        "text": "I'm actually here quite often, especially when the weather is cold. There's nothing like a boiling, bubbling bowl of soon du bu (soft tofu soup) to warm your belly on a cold night, and I do think they have the best soon du bu in Philadelphia.\n\nThe prices are pretty affordable as well, as ordering one order should probably fill you up quite nicely. At $10 a pop, it's not a bad deal, even though back in the day it was $8, then $9... inflation!\n\nAll of them are good, and it really is a matter of personal taste, but here are my favorites:\n- Kimchi soon du bu - The best thing about the kimchi soon du bu here is that it also comes with beef. Many other places that serve kimchi soon du bu just have the kimchi in the soup. The beef definitely adds to it.\n- Beef soon du bu - Also very good.\n- Soy bean (daeng jang) soon du bu - This is sort of an acquired taste, and doesn't come with any meat in it... but I love that salty soy bean taste!\n\nThe other thing that happens at many Korean restaurants is that you get to choose the level of heat. If you're a novice, I'd suggest the 2 or 3. If you love spicy foods, try the 5... the soup comes out deep red.\n\nThrow in the raw egg and let it cook in the stew... it adds another dimension. Enjoy the side dishes (pan chan) and try not to burn the roof of your mouth when you dig in!"

I think next time however I will probably try the level below very spicy, just so I can taste the Soon Du Bu more. The side dishes (free refills) that comes with the entrees are also delicious! It was only like a 11$ dinner after tip. The only problem I have is that I wish it was closes to downtown philly."

Third, the place is approved by Korean diners (as I witnessed the place packed with locals on a Wednesday night). Last, I'm coming back again."

I don't get it anywhere else because it just doesn't compare!\n\nIf you aren't a big fan of spice, you can get your tofu non-spicy but if you're like me and can't live without the kick in your mouth, you can get your tofu very spicy (or something in between) and trust me, it burns...oh-so-good!\n\nEach soon dubu arrives boiling and with a generous portion of rice. Before the tofu gets to your table, you're served with an array of side dishes which are quite delectable. \n\nThe last time my friend & I ate here, we ordered a side of BBQ Squid along with our tofu. The squid was pretty massive & had to be cut with a pair of scissors the waiter provided- once we cut it into chunks, it was easily devoured!\n\nThe staff is always courteous and very friendly, the menu prices are superb and their food is absolutely delicious. I can't say enough good things about this place!"
