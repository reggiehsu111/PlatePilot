Maybe it's a matter of taste, but personally, I was not a fan of their thick noodles, and extremely salty broth.  \n\nThe service was great, and they had a nice selection of beers!  The friend I went with loved it, and has been many times.  Honestly, I'm just sorry I wasn't a bigger fan.  But I hope others try it for themselves.  I might just be an oddball out on this one."

Amazing flavor, and a smoky , meaty feel though it is meatless. Then came the coconut curry ramen. Heaven in a bowl. \nMy only complaint is when you have to wait for seating there is no way to hang by the bar without constantly feeling you are in The servers' way as they breeze by with deliciousness in bowls and plates. So worth the wait before heading to the theater. Plus, food comes out very quickly so we made the curtain, just barely, but with really happy tummies."

There are tons of interesting appetizers to try--we had dumplings with corn and mushrooms, wings, and some specials that are escaping me. Each of us also got an order of noodles. These are not chinatown noodle house portions, but they also aren't chinatown noodle house ingredients. Interesting, fresh, and tasty. Plus its a great deal and BYO to boot. Great addition to 10th street!"

If we had stopped there, the bill would have been $24. But the dumplings were so good we had to get another order and the cocktails were so good we had to each get (ahem) two more. And the food in general was so delicious that we wanted to try some entrees. The brisket ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and the meat was very tender. The shrimp dan dan noodles were peanutty and creamy. Service was very attentive and friendly and even with all the booze, the bill was more than reasonable. Can't wait to come back!"

My husband and I were craving ramen noodles for weeks and we went there hoping to get some tasty Ramen, little did we know that their food was unbelievably tasty. The flavors and the unexpected twist to their menu went above and beyond what we expected. \nI got the Brisket Ramen and my husband got the Lamb, they were both amazing but I highly recommend the Brisket. \nThis is restaurant has moved to my top 3 places to eat at in Philly. OUTSTANDING food and great service!"

The dumpling dough is perfectly chewy and excellent as far as thickness.  The filling I thought was a little under seasoned, but when I rolled it around in the Chili Oil, it was quite tasty.\n\nI also had the burger, which I thought was an unusual item to have on the menu for a noodle bar, but thought it would be interesting to try.  The burger is on more of a denser bread than a typical bun, and the mustard greens and acidic sauces worked great together.  The burger had a lot of Eastern flavors, but was still a burger, a well cooked one, at that.  Enjoyed a quick tasty lunch for 12 bucks.  As the temperatures rise this summer, I'll probably try the cold noodles and I think the ramen is calling for me this winter."

My friends and I actually started with the Black Garlic Wings (6), which is great to share with 3 people. The wings were tangy and sweet, very flavorful, and I definitely recommend giving them a try. We also ordered the Butternut Rangoon, and can I just say that I could probably eat like twenty of those and be so happy with my life. They were so light and crispy, and absolutely addicting.\n\nI ordered the Coconut Curry Noodles with a marinated egg. The the broth was so full of curry and a sweet coconut flavor, it was delicious! I also appreciated that the broth had a bit of heat to it, because the spicier the better in my opinion.The noodles were soft, and filling--so fun to slurp right up. \n\nFor two apps, and three bowls, it came out to $26, including tip, and I was full for the rest of the day!Definitely recommend trying this spot if you're ever in the city and need something to warm you up. I will be back to Cheu sometime soon!"

I have to say, had the burger and pork belly buns and they were excellent. Also had the BBQ crisp appetizer that had a great flavor yet it needed something to soak up the sauce. Finally had the lamb braised noodles and they were great. Again I wanted to soak up every ounce of the sauce. They should go against the norm and serve a nice crusty bread- blasphemy you might say but seriously something must be done to soak up these flavors.\n\nNow onto the bad part, the prices.  Way too expensive for everything. Nan Zhou hand drawn noodles Isn't that far away and their delicious noodles are 3-5 bucks depending on either the peanut or soy pork sauce; Cheu's prices are around 11-15, and small to boot. Also sampan isn't far away with a great priced happy hour. I know Cheu is just starting up, so hopefully after a time they will be a little more affordable.\n\nThis place is great with a comfy feel and a warm and inviting staff.  I will be back, just not often or I'll be broke."

The pork shoulder falls apart with the grab of chopsticks. nicely done. \n\nBrisket Ramen - two big slices of Brisket, quantity over powers quality. To be honest Brisket was flavorless.

Quality of dishes wasn't up to Cheu's standard.  Service was curt.  \n\n- BOTTOM LINE:  It pains me to give this place 3 stars.  A year ago, I emphetically would proclaim it to be my favorite restaurant in the city.  But they've lost their way.  Hand torn noodles are gone from the menu.

        "text": "There were quite a few reasons why I could not give Cheu a five-star rating but it does not include the food. First, Cheu is a small location. There are only three tables crammed into a small nook which should onlyt. Second, VERY limited seating. Therefore, this place does not offer reservations, except in extreme cases, and seating it fills up fast. \n\nHowever, the food does come out at a fast rate so I cannot see why anyone would want to eat, relax and talk for a bit. The noise level is rather loud and the music does not help in that aspect. \n\nBesides those little annoyances, Cheu does offer delicious ramen that is worth the wait and crammed area. The secret lies in their small menu that is precise and allows to make ramen a specialty. I tasted ramen from other restaurants and the menus tend to be huge; lots of combinations, food seems rushed and put together; but not here. \n\nThe slices of brisket in my ramen was lean and non-fatty and the broth was absolutely delicious. Cheu does offer apps as well but you can feel up on the ramen alone; but if you must try an appetizer try the Garlic Wings or/and the Pizza Dumplings.\n\nBack to the ramen! I added an soft boiled egg that perfectly complemented the noodles and a Spiked Juice w/ Rum to top it off. Although the noodle bar is pricey the tasty and satisfying dishes makes it worth the investment"

I'm hoping to try everything on the menu. \n\nIt's cute no seriously the only way I can describe this noodle bar is cute its like if a bunch of american teens got together and opened a noodle shop cute. I like that I can also watched the chefs make the food if I am at the bar it makes the experience a bit more interactive, I know I'm reaching but it's honestly like watching the cooking channel and them handing the food to you when its done.  \n\nThe drinks are daring and cool looking, okay im not much of a drinker in fact I prefer for my drinks to taste like anything but alcohol but still they are great to look at. \n\nCons.\n\nIt's a little tight. But in today's economy most new restaurants are and I'm here for that. So leave more good reviews and hopefully in enough time they get a bigger spot.\n\nThis is more of an unpopular request but maybe a sake lemonade or sangria for us sweet cocktail lovers or a sweet cider on the beer menu. \n\nIt's a little pricey for ramen I say that only because I realize that I pay so much because I need an appetizer with it or I won't be full. I always leave wanting more food."

Came here with my boyfriend when we were in Philadelphia for a business trip. The place is small and cozy. When we got there, it was 9pm and had been walking around in 20degree weather, so we were down for something warm. Here is where half a star leaves the rating. The hostess did not look like she wanted anyone coming in. She had a little attitude when she told us to stand by the ramen wall. When seats were available, the hostess took her sweet time cleaning up despite people waiting to be seated.  I understand the place is a little cramped but it does not take 10mins to clean a table, especially if the table is literally 3x3. The waiter and waitress were wonderful and after we had ordered I was watching the chef cook.  The other half star for the following: The entire time the chef was cooking, she would pull her phone out and text. That's disgusting! She wasn't wearing gloves also. The chef is picking up up ingredients with her hands that she just used to text and puts them into the bowls they're serving! Now onto the food. My bf and both got the miso ramen with the spicy bean paste as an add on. The broth was good but after adding the spicy bean paste and mixing in the egg, it got creamy and even better.  If I was back in Philadelphia, I might consider coming back but probably if it was a last resort."

When I was last here half a year ago, I was less-than-impressed, but this time, the staff was friendlier and the ramen was close to perfect.\n\nWe came for a late lunch, minutes before they were supposed to close at 3pm. The waiter still good-naturedly accommodated us, providing fast and attentive service. \n\nThe noodles were chewy, and whereas last time they were a little clumpy, this time, they were perfect. The broth was not too salty and somehow managed to be full flavored and (refreshingly) light at the same time. The meat was meltingly tender, though a little broken-up for my tastes, and the soft-cooked egg was perfect.\n\nWe also ordered a special grapefruit juice, whose tart flavor complimented the ramen and served nicely as a palate cleanser.\n\nAfter eating ramen, I often fall into a sodium stupor and feel mildly ill for at least half a day, but after Cheu ramen, I felt pleasantly full. The attentive service and delicious ramen made for a much-improved experience."

The noodles were tasty and the picked vegetables added a great contrast to the heartiness of the broth that kept the flavor balanced and not too savory. I also added on the black garlic wings because they were having a lunch special (add an app for $4). I was not a huge fan; even with lime juice sprinkled on the top, the fry on the wings was too heavy for me; I wonder if they were twice-fried? While I appreciated the crispiness, I would pass on these the next time around. I would add a caution that the restaurant is small and filled up for weekday lunch by about 12:15; they only have 4 2-person tables, 1 4-person table, and then the seats at the bar.

It was tasty and very refreshing.\n\nSo the ramen itself was pretty amazing. I ordered it with a soft boiled egg, which was prepared weird.

Crazy! The food wasn't bad, but I hope it's better when you eat in. One day I'll go back and eat in, but not any time soon.\n\nI ordered the al pastor dumplings and the miso ramen.\n\nDumplings: You get five. They were a lot smaller than I imagined (like WAY smaller), but it's very interesting to basically put al pastor tacos (my favorite) into dumplings. They were really good, but way too small to be charging $6. \n\nMiso Ramen: They send the broth separate from the rest, wrapped in saran wrap to ensure no spills, which was cool. The noodles were a little stiff and stuck together, and there was hardly any meat. This is unacceptable for a whopping $14 (I've had a comparable bowl that was way better and had thrice as much meat as Cheu's for $9 in Chinatown). If this were $8, I would ignore the hard noodles stuck together in a ball and no meat, but for $5 more than the other guy who's better, Cheu is being held to a higher standard.\n\nI expected more from Cheu after everything I heard about it. Even if they don't care about the quality of delivery orders and only put effort into eat in orders, this place is way too expensive for what you get.

As a tenured service industry employee, I completely get venting about work or even about customers who are jerks but since I was minding my own business and close enough to hear her rag on me, I was perplexed. Then, when another man came in, angling for my seat, the same server looked at my full beer and half full bowl and told him that I'd be leaving shortly which was glaringly inaccurate and made me feel super rushed.

We sat sat the bar which was awesome! We first ordered the dumplings (beef that night) and they were excellent. We added in more oil that was on the bar- game changer, it was so good! We then both got the brisket ramen, because it's what Thrillist told us to. It was a 7/10. The brisket had a huge layer of fat on top, which turned me off. There was also some sort of pickled cabbage or something that I could do without. The broth was awesome and the noodles were great. Overall, I would go back if I was around that neighborhood."

Highlights at this place are the Miso Ramen and Brisket Ramen. The broths on both are so flavorful. This is the type of noodle place to play Blink 182 one day and Notorious BIG the next.

Knowing it is a small place, Cheu was chosen off the \"to eat\" list because my boyfriend and I were both starving, but it was around 3pm. I thought it would be a good idea to go on an off time, and it was perfect. Everyone else was right- it is small. However, it is also so much cuter than I was expecting! The mural wall with bright colors and dangling Christmas lights gave a very endearing feel. We were so pleased to be offered bar seats too, so we could watch all the chefs in action.\n\nAfter reading so much about the black garlic wings, I was bummed when my boyfriend begged to order the fries to start. However, this disappointment quickly faded to joy when I tasted the fries. They were perfectly cooked and covered in miso aoli with shredded tuna flakes on top. Sounds weird, tastes ridiculously good. \n\nWe split the miso ramen bowl and the brisket with matzo ball. I loved that this place was unauthentic, especially since you are unapologetically warned of this fact on both the menu and the website. All you traditional ramen haters can go eat at your traditional places because I haven't had a noodle bowl this good anywhere else in Philly! I liked the miso broth better and the pickled veggies on top were divine. My advice: add a soft egg to anything you order! Yum! We slurped down every bit of both bowls, even with sweat on our brows. (If they have air conditioning here, it definitely wasn't on...).\n\nThe only negative I have heard prior that deterred me was that there weren't any hot noodle bowls that were vegetarian. However, there was definitely one on the menu, and the option to add tofu too. So maybe some things have changed, or maybe my roommate just wasn't reading the menu closely enough... who knows. The bottom line: Cheu, I love you."

Staff, ambience, music and everything else - great.\n\nBlack Garlic Wings w/ shishito peppers & herbs - this is how I fantasize wings to taste in my mind and lives up to all the raves. sharp asian spice profile with some lime tang, I have never tasted anything like it. A personal favorite, shishito peppers, are yummy to eat as well. I was a bit confused about if I should or should not eat it, but it tasted fabulous, so why not ?\n\nFish Ribs -w/ charred corn, tamarind & herbs - The corns were crunchy and fresh. Im a sucker for crispy fish skin however the fish aspect of this particular type of fish was entirely too overwhelming for me personally. So be prepared !\n\nThin egg noodles w/ egg, matzo balls & chile broth - The quality of the brisket is phenomenal and cooked to perfection. The broth is spicy and well seasoned w/ generous serving of noodles. Who knew a delicious matzo ball could compliment the whole dish so well. Also that matzo ball was no joke. Loved it. However, the spoon that comes with it is a tad awkward to eat out of. They need a different one thats more easier to eat with. \n\nHand Torn noodle w/ lamb neck, pickled mustard greens & dates - This was my second favorite dish after the wings. The lamb melts in your mouth and its texture compliments the wide noodles perfectly. Lucious and a mouthfull that is bursting with complex flavors of spice, tang and sesame. The pickled mustard greens cuts the richness of the lamb perfectly. \n\nThey also have a good list of beer and limited, but nice liquor list."

It is incredible to watch the cooks and servers work together, I have never seen a team more in sync. And then there's the wonder twins. One is a cook and one is a server and the girl next to me thought she was going crazy. I have Kyle (the server wonder twin) as my server. He was great, very knowledgeable and fast. \n  Now to the food. Hot damn. This ramen. I got the miso ramen and it was perfect. The noodles were perfectly done and the ingredients melded perfectly.

I also tried adding an extra egg for $1 which is a veryyy good addition. Just do it!! The portion is real nice too but there's also an option of adding an extra noodle for $2 that I might try next time to prolong my period of bliss. \n\nI've tried the award-winning black garlic wings as well but I didn't really understand the hype and what was soooo special about those wings, however. It was decent but not the best I've ever had. So 5 stars for the noodles and 3 stars for the wings! \n\nThis place is pretty small so the wait can be a while since everyone wants to come eat here... but it's sooo worth the wait! My take-out experience wasn't as good as dining in; they still packed my noodles to make sure they didn't get soggy but something about it wasn't the same...

        "text": "It's hard not to pay attention to Cheu, not only are they a block away from home, if you like them on FaceBook, they tell you what they are serving for lunch, what they are serving for dinner everyday. The menu changes all the time, there are specials, there are events. You get a sense that the place is really happening. Especially the lunch post makes you look forward to dinner all day, it's a catch all. The fact that the place is still packed 4 months after its opening is a testament on how well the place is doing. \n\nI might have given an unfair review to Cheu last time, because they really just opened and haven't really gain a footing yet but what I like about Cheu is that they are continuously working on refining their dishes while trying to be consistent on service and quality. They have a liquor license now, which I'm sure makes everybody happy. The weaker dishes gave way to new innovative dishes. Portions seems to be slightly bigger and more satisfying. I find the willingness to please their clients impressive. \n\nI haven't tried all their new plates yet, since the menu change everyday, I have to time my visit but what I've had are pretty good. The fish ribs has become one of my all time favorite dish. Crispy skin with a slightly sweet tamarind glaze, while the skin is crispy the meat is not dry, it's perfectly cooked. Just take out the few bones and chomp down on the whole thing. My plate came with some awesome charred corn Elotes style, which I understand they are so good that they are now its own appetizers. \n\nI thought the scrapple was so good before but now they have added a mustard sauce with sweet cubes of melons. It does elevate the dish to another level. The mustard added some acidity and the melons added a great sweet contrast. Pig tails are nuggets of goodness, they reminded me of Chinese BBQ ribs except with smaller bones which makes them fun to nibble.\n\nI thought the dumplings were ok, the stuffing changes everyday so some days you'll get better one than others. Since most people come in pairs, how about serving 4 instead of 3? I'm a little torn about the Jade noodles, I like the composition but I feel like it's missing a wedge of lime or a pinch of shredded red pickled ginger for dimension's sakes. \n\nService is still impeccable. I'm very happy to have them in my neighborhood. I'm eager to come back for the beef tongue fried rice, cross my fingers that it comes back soon."

I came here with my boyfriend and a couple friends for dinner one night recently, and sadly we weren't impressed. I'm a big fan of Asian noodle soups, so I was really excited to try this place, too! \n\nI got the coconut curry noodle soup which sounded promising. The curry broth flavor was initially pretty good, but it was soon overpowered by the huge glob of peanut sauce they put in the bowl. In general, I like peanut sauce but I found the flavor combo really weird, and the peanut sauce was thick and jelly-like in texture, which I found gross. I ate about half of the soup and then gave up. My boyfriend and another friend ordered the brisket soup. Neither of them liked the dish again due to the \"off\" flavor. My other friend who ordered the hand torn soup did enjoy her meal, though. \n\nOn to the drinks...I'm not a big fan of canned beer to begin with, but I figured I'd give a new one a try. They have several options, but I didn't find any standouts on the list. I  decided to go with the Brewers Art brown ale which I found to be super bitter. I wasn't excited about any of the other beer options, so I decided to stop there. One of my friends didn't like the beer she chose either.\n\nAlso, the place is quite small and only has a couple tables up front, so the four of us had to sit side by side at the bar. It was hard to have a conversation with the whole group because it was pretty loud in there. \n\nOverall, I was just disappointed because I've heard so many good things about Cheu. Given my experience, I probably won't be back. I will just have to stick to the more traditional Asian noodle soup places that I love!"

Cheu has a modern Asian vibe with some cool artsy decor scattered throughout the small interior. It's always been crowded when I've gone, so expect to wait no matter what time you stop by. Here's a quick summary of my thoughts:\n\n(+)\n-Fried Chicken Tantan - unique, warm, soupy goodness\n-Crispy Sweet Potato Rangoon - so good, you'll want to order more\n-ambience\n-noise level\n-prices are pretty fair, considering the location\n\n(-)\n-some of the food like the Coconut Curry Noodles and the Brisket Ramen (unremarkable)\n-service is sometimes harsh since it gets so crowded\n-wait time\n-crowded interior - you're going to be pretty close to all of the other diners"

(It was so good I forgot to take a photo!) \n\nWe also had the dumplings in chili oil - reminded me more of a ravioli than a Chinese dumpling, but I loved it! Wasn't too spicy and the dumpling skin was nice and chewy.\n\nAnother dish we had and of course, loved, was the pork belly rice bowl. It's a katsu so the pork belly is slightly breaded and fried. Oh my, the pork was sooooo tender. The sushi rice they used paired perfectly with the pork and the katsu sauce they used. I'm drooling just thinking about it.

I eat everything from beef to seafood to veggies, unfortunately my girlfriend doesn't and ordering for a person who only eats chicken and vegetables; Cheu falls a little short. I ordered the lamb noodles and ordered the pork shoulder ramen without the pork for my girlfriend. We both enjoyed it however the pork ramen was very bland so we had to add a healthy serving of Sriracha to make it to our liking. \n\nThis place is good if you're a full on carnivore like myself, alas I now have to be more selective on the types of restaurants I choose when I go out my girl. It sucks!!! Anyway sorry for getting side tracked. I had to give it a 3 just because of the lack of menu choices and vegetarian options."

The Miso Ramen and Brisket Ramen bowls we had were very good - rich in flavor, spiced just right, unique sauces.  Cheu is a funky place with a young, cozy vibe.  If I lived in downtown Philly, Cheu would be a weekly visit."

There's also often a long wait, though I was there on a Tuesday night around 6 pm and was lucky to get at able for two without a wait.\n\nOnly other negative is I do think it's just a tad overpriced. I mean, it is still soup and noodles (with perhaps a little protein), so leaving down over $20 for a soup and a few dumplings is a little more than I would've liked. \n\nBut it's by no means not worth it - if you're a ramen fan, or are thinking of trying it, Cheu is a fantastic choice."

I hopped onto yelp and decided to head over here.  I remember reading about this place on foobooz before so i was curious.  Plus it seemed more fun than the other ramen places.  It was almost a perfect night.  We got parking right across the street and seated immediately at the bar.  Sad to say i kept on bumming elbows with the woman next to me.  I wish there was a bit more elbow room.  Note to the owners: elbow room is a necessity when eating noodles!  Just try eating with your elbows tucked in, not so fun eh?!?  Also, i would have to minus points for the bartender.  He served me a flight of the sake (one was soju).  However, he did not shake the sake.  It was a nigori, i mean how could he not know.  Sad to say i just let it go, usually i would have mentioned something but it was just a shot.  Okay i've vented.\n\nWe ordered the mung bean and the chicken bun.  Both were delicious and the bun was not of the white dough kind that was expected.  This one was more of the brown flakey kind.  Nevertheless it was good and i would order it again.  They did forget to bring out the special cheeseburger bun that the bf ordered.  Next was the garlic flavored wings.  The carnivorous bf devoured it.  I had the smoked fish ribs.  This has got to be one of the best thing i ever ate.  It was a paku which is a cousin of the piranha.  The dish was very flavorful. The skin was crispy and perfect.  It was definitely a party in my mouth.  We ordered the pork and miso cod ramen.  The cod was cooked perfectly with a little crispness.  The noodles were cooked al dente, it was great.  The broth was mediocre, i'm trying to remember it but there was really nothing memorable about it.  The bf finished his bowl completely.  \n\nYikes! we got the bill and for 2 people it was about 86 with tip.  What a pricey ramen experience!"

Don't waste your money or time here.\n\nI had the miso ramen and it was sweet! I never had sweet miso broth before. The sweetness drowned out the miso flavor. Even the pork shoulder had a sweet glaze on it that did not appeal to me and I didn't bother to finish the pork shoulder. The noodles were hard, clumped together and I didn't get enough broth with my ramen. Good thing I was very hungry, otherwise I wouldn't have finished eating the miso ramen. \n\nThis place is also expensive for Philly. The miso ramen is $14. This is Philly not NYC. I have paid ~$15 for good ramen in NYC. \n\nI also had an unimpressive sangria...small glass filled with mostly ice for $10. \n\nThe decorative lights made it feel like it was Christmas. \n\nI will definitely stick to traditional ramen places."

We ended up enjoying the nightly dumpling special (among the best I have ever had), the broccoli, the black garlic wings, all three of their buns (get the pork belly), the Boloanasian, and the brisket (complete with a matzo ball).  To top it off, they have daily, fresh pressed juice concoctions that you can easily throw a few shots into.\n\nEach dish was just as amazing as the last.

The atmosphere is edgy, if a little try-hard, and the food is pretty decent. \n\nI'm not sure if the whole disinterested hipster vibe translates well to service - our waiters were present, if a little robotic. They would stop by to ask if the food was \"delicous,\" then slide away before we had a chance to really answer.\n\nThe miso ramen was surprisingly tasty, though the broth was a little thinner than I'm used to. The meat was fall-apart tender, the soft-cooked egg was perfect, and the noodles were chewy, if a little underdone with a few clumps where the noodles had stuck together.\n\nThe curried egg and rice dumplings were not my favorite. They were somewhat lacking in flavor - to me, they tasted like some yellow rice wrapped in thick dumpling skins. The wings were a good balance of sweet and salty, though I would have liked a little more sauce. Some of the pieces had barely any sauce and ended up tasting like fried chicken.\n\nThe teas were pretty good, though the hot ginger-honey tea tasted suspiciously similar to the ginger crystal tea mix I buy at Chinese supermarkets.\n\nAll in all, I like that Cheu experiments with different flavors, using Asian cuisine as a springboard for creativity rather than a box within which all dishes must be contained. That being said, our dinner was a bit hit-and-miss and didn't leave me with any strong desire to come back."

It is not \"textbook\" style and doesn't claim to be; I'm glad they have their own takes on every menu item. The prices are amazing, as well. My girlfriend and I usually order 2 appetizers, some noodles with multiple add-ons, and a beer or two, and we usually average around $50-60 for a very satisfying, well-portioned meal.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very small, so don't come expecting to easily fit a group any bigger than 4. There's a fairly long bar with about 10 seats, with tightly packed tables in the corners. It's best as a \"table for 2\" spot to enjoy one-on-one conversation. \n\nI appreciate the staff's friendliness and speed in even the busiest times. They're all willing to assist and help with any requests. Don't let the wait times deter you - you may find yourself being told that a table will take an hour or more during dinner hours, but head around the corner to Strangelove's or any other bar in the immediate area and grab a beer for the wait.

The last lunch visit our group's bowls were all quite salty (and they were different orders/dishes).  The salt dominated so heavily that adding a bowl of hot water didn't improve any and it was hard to enjoy even on a hungry stomach (btw, I think they were insulted that we thought it was so salty but that's what it was.)  this would mark the 2nd time I thought my ramen was too salty (2nd time topped the first).\n\nThe hipster interiors is vibrant, but if you sit at the corner of the bar table, be ready to be interrupted constantly and bumped on by people trying to get by.

The wait was initially quoted as an hour, but someone finished up early and I only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. \n\nThey had an interesting selection of beers and cocktails, but I wasn't thirsty so much as hungry so I passed on the drinks. The menu was very simple and straightforward, and I ordered the crab broth noodles and dumplings in chili oil. \n\nThe dumplings in chili oil came first, there were 4 cute dumplings in a small bowl. They were very tasty, but were different than what I was expecting. Growing up in Asia, dumplings usually have higher fat content and are easier to chew, but I guess the meat in these dumplings were leaner and took a bit longer to chew through.\n\nThe crab broth noodles came shortly after, and I must say I was pretty disappointed. I passed over the miso ramen for these noodles, and the soup in this broth was a bit spicy and sour, but wasn't as brothy as they claimed. The hand-drawn noodles were quite tasty and bouncy, but to me they were ruined by the broth. \n\nOverall, I'd give the dumplings a 4, the noodles a 2.5, and the overall experience a 3.5.

I will probably ask next time I go, as they seem very willing to customize to your liking.\nThe dumplings in chili oil were just awesome, the day I went they were beef and long hot as the filling and I could have eaten twice as many.\n\nNoodle Bowls:\nThe Coconut Curry was very good and at the recommendation of the server I added pork shoulder (which wasn't an option on the menu but was only +$2).  I thoroughly enjoyed the dish overall and would happily eat it again.\nThe Sichuan was quite good and very spicy!  I warn you now, do not get this unless you like spicy, it is almost to the point where it over-powers the other flavors (it probably would for many).  This dish doesn't really have a broth to speak of, just lots of hand torn noodles.\n\nHighly recommended and I will absolutely be returning."

I really didn't care for the noodles at all.. They seemed stuck together and not properly made.. It reminded me of tagliatelle pasta I make at home before I learned how to properly execute the process. The broth was weak in seasoning all together. The matzo ball took on the flavor of the broth so i didn't really care for it. It was really disappointing after so many good reviews from friends.. Maybe their recent increase in popularity is making their food quality and consistency suffer? That being said, the staff was very nice and I got my food quickly despite how busy they were.

I guess it's my Asian roots coming out, but this was a little too far fetched for me. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my meal but I thought it was overpriced and over-hyped. I wouldn't return for the ramen any time soon. \n\nI got the Brisket Ramen (aka char siu ramen with kimchi), my boyfriend got their special Breakfast Ramen (aka eggs, bacon and mini waffle), and we split the Honey Garlic wings. Let me start off that I'm a little obsessed with their wings. I think it was double fried so it was super crispy and the meat was juicy and tender. The sauce was a tiny bit too salty but overall the appetizer was amazing and worth the $10 I paid for it. My bowl of ramen wasn't bad but definitely not worth what I paid for it. I thought the brisket (still char siu) was cooked really well and I appreciated that they gave a decent amount. Again, I didn't think it was bad, just that it wasn't amazing. My boyfriend thought his was barely average and was sorry that he fell for the waffle gimmick because at the end of the day, it was a basic bowl of noodles/eggs/bacon and a random waffle thrown on top of it. The place was really cool with a graffiti wall and hand drawn cartoons everywhere but small and packed with people in beanies and beards."

Dealing with an unexpectedly warm October evening, our initial plans of \"warming up with some yummy broth\" were not necessary, but we had a craving, and the only thing that could sate my buddy and I was ca-noodling at Cheu. We strolled in around 7:20 and the place was nowhere close to full. There were about 3 people at the bar and two sitting down, so we were immediately seated at the window. The inside of Cheu is warm and welcoming, the chalkboard showing off the daily specials (tea, beers, food, etc). A carafe of ice water was brought to our table, menus placed in front of us, and we were excited for a night out.\n\nCue when things took a turn for the questionable. I'm not sure if this is standard fare for Cheu, or just due to being a little bare bones, but we had two servers visiting our table periodically. I initially thought maybe one would just be to refresh our water, but they (a man and a woman) would follow after the other often less than a minute behind, asking the same questions. \n\n\"Have you decided on a drink?\" ..... \"Can I get you ladies some drinks?\"\n\nWait. Didn't I just tell that guy we weren't ready yet?\n\n\"Can I get that plate off the table for you yet?\" (Oh, no, we're still working on it, thanks.) .... \"Hey, want me to clear that plate for you, girls?\"\n\nNo, we haven't even taken another bite since that lady stopped by... what is happening?\n\nIf they looked even moderately similar, I'd have felt insane deja vu that would've suggested that I, too, was insane.\n\nAs far as food goes, we enjoyed the shaved kale with dates, pepitas, and cheese curds, coconut curry (for my vegetarian pal) and classic miso ramen with pork shoulder. The curry was spicy and delicious, heavy on the broth and the heat. The more classic-style ramen was definitely jonesing for a little kick, added with chili oil and sriracha. Our duo of servers were attentive, almost to a fault. Like... interrupting us to check in, desiring seemingly bite to bite updates. That being said, the bites were quite tasty. The pork shoulder was a little tough, but otherwise all quite good. We enjoyed our cans of beer and our food, which was swept away immediately the second we finished our food. Our male server came over to let us know that, despite receiving our check, \"No hurry though, take your time.\"\n\nFive minutes later, the moment after we placed our card down for the check, the female server came over and, despite our earlier server letting us know \"no hurry\" she  told us, in no uncertain terms, that \"because we have a waiting list, we need you to leave the table.\"\n\nEx-SQUEEZE ME? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!\n\nShocked by the sudden change in what we were supposed to do, we left, my friend just barely finishing the last of her drink.  I felt like this behavior totally ruined the experience for me, which was not going too poorly up to the point. But now, whenever I think of Cheu, I won't remember the ramen slipping through my chopsticks or the curdy kale. I will remember a rude, confusing waitress hustling me out the door as soon as we put down our tip. \n\nIf I had the ability to take the tip back and reduce it, I would."

As my boyfriend and I are Japanese, it was very difficult for us to divorce the idea of a bowl of noodles from ramen, so perhaps this was the reason I cannot give Cheu a perfect rating. However, it's definitely an adventurous time.\n\nWe ordered the beef dumplings, Brisket noodles, and the Spicy Shrimp Broth noodles. The dumplings had a wonderful gingery bite and the chili oil was not too strong. However, I would remove the fried quinoa if I could as they tended to get stuck in your teeth and linger in your mouth far longer than the enjoyment of the dumpling.\n\nThe soup of the brisket noodles had strong hints of Korean cuisine and was flavored similarly to the sour and spicy taste of kimchi. The brisket was perfectly soft and I was surprised at how well the matzo ball worked with the broth.\n\nThe spicy shrimp broth noodles were a bit of a let down as the hero of the dish, the fried shrimp balls were minuscule and did not add too much to the experience. The broth was clearer, light, and had a lot of Vietnamese notes. The combination of raw onions, bean sprouts, and shrimp balls was not a home-run for me.\n\nThe vibe and service is excellent, and this place definitely worth at least one try."

Ordered a pineapple jalape\u00f1o vanilla juice- which was surprisingly sweeter than I expected. Ordered dumplings and the crispy pork belly rice. The food came crazy quick. The rice wasn't piping hot, but the pork belly was. It was pretty good, but the dumplings were my favorite. Piping hot and flavorful. It's a very small place so get here off peak times, if not, you will wait. I might come back to try actual noodles- having severe regret as the miso ramen looked great!"

We were told a 15 minutes wait, for 2 of us, and waited 40... However the staff is friendly and apologetic even when we didn't complain they sent us an appetizer on them. \n\nThere are only 3 tables in this tiny place, and a dozen or so bar top seats, so this is not good for groups, the dishes are creative and pretty, but the ramen broth is lacking in flavor and the sauce they put on the Brussels was sweet and unnecessary. Also the house made sriracha is in a plastic bottle on the table, that says, 'application for profession use only' which is clearly not a bottle for food service, it's for hair dying!"

And, based on recent visits, it's clear that the greater the blanket of snow and ice that covers the city, the longer the wait for scarce counter and small table space at Cheu.  The block is quiet, the exterior fairly nondescript, but open the door and pull back the heavy curtain and you are thrown into a teeming mass of eager foodie fanatics.  The narrow, crowded kitchen is brimming with electric energy, all in full view:  steam rising from pots, broth being ladled in every direction, gas flames leaping around small pans on the stove, and noodles torn with artful precision.  \n\nEverything that emerges from the kitchen is a unique, creative, and fresh concoction with a masterful balance of the five basic tastes.  The appetizer special was a dazzling combination of sauteed mustard greens, toasted farro, and miso dressing, topped with a handful of crispy fried lotus, a fabulous flavor and texture scheme.  The regular menu features a small plate (which could really be a meal) consisting of broccoli sauteed with ample morsels of Vietnamese sausage and tossed with crushed peanuts and unidentifiable but magical spices.  \n\nBoth of our noodle dishes were superb and completely different.  The spicy shrimp noodles come in a bowl crowded with bean sprouts, green onion, greens, and shaved daikon, topped with lightly fried shrimp balls.  The broth had the red hue and subtle kick of chilis and the noodles were microscopically thin.    The stars of the Sichuan bowl are thick, delicious, hand-torn wheat noodles coated in hot bean paste and stir-fried to a slight crisp.  Interspersed with the noodles are bright greens and diced fresh tofu, and the dish is finished with sesame seeds and ribbons of cucumber.  \n\nDespite the rather raucous and cramped setting, the staff at Cheu are meticulous and generous in providing individual attention.  My revelation of a mushroom allergy touched off a vigorous discussion about which dishes could be created with different combinations of broths and sauces to avoid fungi.  On my second visit, a friendly Cheu employee noted my overcoat covered and dripping with melting snow (as, no doubt, did everyone there), grabbed it and whisked it back to a secret hiding spot in the back of the house to dry.  \n\nOne note of caution:  avoid making a visual estimate of the wait times for a table.   Diners tend to leave their names and then disperse into neighborhood bars to await phone calls summoning them to eat."

My friend and I tried to come here twice and both times, there was a 25-minute wait so we decided to wait the second time. Unfortunately, there's only one small bench and really absolutely nothing else around, so you can't even get froyo or something, you're sort of just left standing around outside. (You can't stand around inside either bc there's no space)\n\nOnce we were finally seated, I realized why there was a consistent wait. This place has pretty limited seating. Including the bar area, there are only about 20 seats total. The bar area is somewhat cramped so you're literally elbow to elbow with those on either side of you. At the bar, you're also naturally facing the somewhat small kitchen. I like watching cooks at work and I saw that they make their own noodles, which is nice. \n\nI got the miso ramen ($13). It was good and the broth was flavorful and not too salty but I thought the portion size and the amount of meat was a little lacking for that price. I'd probably come back but do not come if you're starving because there will likely be a wait and if you outlast the wait, then I'd advise getting extra meat or noodles with your ramen."

The buzz is well deserved.  \n\nGrafitti/collage combined with dry ramen noodles being used as a wall decoration was just too flippin' adorable.\n\nPork was the dumpling special of the day and chicken was the Bahn Mi of the day.  So we ordered both of those and the ramen.\n\nTHESE ARE THE BEST DUMPLINGS I HAVE EVER HAD.  And I have eaten a lot of incarnations of dumplings at a lot of different places.  The texture was superb and it absolutely melted in my mouth.  So flavorful.  We asked for chili oil on the side (I was worried about Han Dynasty level heat) but it's relatively mild.\n\nThe ramen was brilliant as well.  It had such an interesting taste; it is a miso based broth but it had this flavor that was just so unique and worked so well.  Cheu poaches the egg instead of soft boiling and that was also a great touch and lets the egg mix infuse with the broth.\n\nThe Bahn Mi was also delicious and loved the spicy mayo as a condiment.  Unfortunately I have an aversion to cilantro and that ended up overpowering the dish.  If you love cilantro then you would probably love this.\n\nService was nice and attentive, the noodle bar overlooks the kitchen so you can see them preparing your dishes.  \n\nSeriously just a fab addition to Philly's noodle scene. A great, small casual dining spot.  Cannot wait to go back!"

They have some lovingly constructed, balanced ramen dishes to suit a range of different palates, and at ~$14 per main dish it won't break the bank. And, yes, everyone should try their brisket ramen because how often do you see a bona-fide matzoh ball in a Japanese dish? \n\nBut the real reason this place gets that 5th star is their staff: Not just because they can handle a hungry crowd waiting for painfully few tables on a Friday night, but because when my girlfriend and I sat down in a bit of a rotten mood (totally unrelated), they noticed. They checked in with us tactfully throughout the meal to make sure everything was okay and that we were being taken care of.  To me that means a lot. \n\nI've been here before and will definitely be back. Next time you're looking for a hot meal in Philly, try Cheu."

What I found was a very cool, fun, fresh take on a noodle bar and I'll be returning.\n\nThe space here is a bit tight and most likely you'll have a wait on a Friday or Saturday evening.  We chose to wait it out at Varga (conveniently located down the street) while our table cleared out.  It didn't take terribly long before we were at our seats and ordering.\n\nI was very impressed with the black garlic wings.  Heat and sweet were the tastes that hit my mouth but I did feel the dish was put together nicely.  The wings were cooked perfectly and it wasn't too sauced.  It had just enough to leave a nice impression.  The dumplings (potato, egg, cheese, chili oil) were not my favorite due to the filling combo, but I would not be opposed to trying more of their dumplings (if they change).\n\nThe star for me was the lamb neck hand torn noodle dish.  The spice on the lamb was killer, and it was falling apart while I tried to eat it.  The mustard greens and dates brought those other flavor punches that made this dish truly excellent.  I would come back and eat here just for this.\n\nThe spot is fun, the music is great (I heard mostly A Tribe Called Quest) and the kitchen worked really well together in the space they have.

Yes, it's a cheap way to keep your hungry customers from eating their own fists (a 90 minute wait on a Saturday night - could have been worse), but that's the kind of thing I like to do at home because I just can't help myself, so thumbs up for that.\n\nDennis L hit it head-on when he said \"The buns are delicious, but not $7 for 2 delicious.\" Seriously. We also had the broccoli & sausage appetizer which was pretty tasty, but not $7 tasty. It's a shame because a lot of the tastes on the appetizer menu looked really intriguing but perhaps not worth the price.\n\nAs for Mr. Significant's brisket, he reported that the meat was a high for him (although I can't vouch as he didn't share - tisk tisk - but a sign  that it really was that good, I suppose.) In fact, all of the meats were the best part of the meal (the pork belly in the bun, the sausage in the broccoli.) I had the duck pho (not true pho as others have pointed out), but the foie gras meatballs in this dish absolutely shine. I'd like to take home about a dozen of those and never leave the house again until they roll me out the door. Oh, and also the egg in the brisket was nearly perfect. We love our runny eggs. (Could I just get a bowl full of ramen noodles and eggs? Somebody open up that kind of shop...)\n\nOverall, Cheu was satisfying but there were things that didn't shine as much as other places.

There are places to sit at the bar and if you're lucky one of only a few tables by the front of the restaurant. The music is pretty loud which didn't bother me but I can see it being irritating to some. I love how you can see the chefs cook out in the open. Really cool. Of the appetizers, I ordered the the Black Garlic Wings. They were a bigger and meatier wing than I typically prefer but it was a very good and unique appetizer none the less. They came with shishito peppers (not spicy), lime, and cilantro. Squeeze the lime onto the sticky sesame sauce and you're in business. For my main entree I throughly enjoyed the Brisket Noodle Soup with Matzo ball, Kimchi, Sesame Chili Broth, and Bok Choy. The broth had the perfect amount of heat. The kimchi really made this dish special. A bit more Kimchi would've been great as I found myself wanting more after I devoured the small amount. The brisket was tender but had some edge fat that I found myself biting around. Leaner meat would be great as the soup seasoning wouldn't disrupt the advantage of a flavorful fatty piece of meat. The matzo ball was not too firm and not too mushy. It was delicious. Overall I was pleased and would certainly return. This isn't a place to go with a large group due to its size. Start working on your chop stick skills so you can have many well balanced bites as you will attempt to put together small pieces of meat, matzo ball, noodle, bok choy, and kimchi within the larger sized deep spoon for some magical mouthfuls. Fyi, desserts are not served here for those with a sweet tooth. You would probably be full anyway."

The restaurant itself is small and intimate with only a few tables and an actual ramen bar. I would recommend this restaurant, but not for large groups. We ended up sitting at the bar which was a cool experience since you can actually watch them cook from there. Behind the bar, the wall is decorated with writing and stickers and at the bottom there are blocks of ramen noodles behind some glass!! On to the drinks/food- While the drink menu here isn't huge, it's not bad and they have specials on the board when you walk in. The menu is also not as large as other restaurants but again, not in a bad way. I ended up getting the miso ramen and ate ALL of it! I got bokchoy add in, but tbh you probably don't need it. The bowl was large and delicious - although it was not was I was expecting. There was definitely a hit of something that made this Ramen taste different than others I have had in the past. The staff here is also very friendly and attentive. My usual go to spot is Nom Nom Ramen on S. 18th, but I think I am going to add Cheu Noodle Bar into the mix!"

There is always plenty of room in this city for a fantastic Asian Fusion restaurant, and Cheu just didn't get it up for me.\n\nSmall plates were neither special or memorable -  For example, wings though perfectly crunchy, lacked the zing or enough black garlic sauce to differentiate them against any other wings in the city (perhaps except for the crunch factor); the sweet potato rangoon, was just that, and the brown butter and goat cheese somehow got lost on me.  \n\nTheir noodle dishes left me wanting so much more, as I have had far superior noodle/ramen dishes both in fusion-esque Chinatown locales (duh) and specifically Nom Nom Ramen (whose broth, flavor profile and ingredients trump Cheu's noodle dish by far)  The broths across most of the noodle dishes lacked the depth of developed flavor, and the ingredients just seemed rather ho-hum (the greens for example, seemed to be both under-cooked and over-cooked, over steamed; the pork shoulder lacked spice, was overdone)\n\nThe service is great, and the space is tiny but intimate.

The one hour waiting time was expected since it was a Saturday afternoon, but I quickly started noticing the flaws I was hoping I wouldn't see.  Customers who were seated 15-20 minutes after me were surprisingly served before I was. Not once did the servers offer to refill my drink or even offer to do anything for me. I didn't want to bring race into this review, but I couldn't help notice that the servers were a lot more attentive and helpful to their Caucasian customers even if they were seated after me.  But still, I tried to look past that and tried to make the most out of my first Cheu Noodle Bar experience.  After waiting for almost an hour for a bowl of their spicy crab noodle soup, I was met with extreme disappointment once I started eating. The soup tasted like spicy Italian sausage soup from my local Olive Garden. I even tried my girlfriend's yakisoba and was disgusted.  They fucking put tomatoes and cheese in their yakisoba!? It tasted more like an Alfredo or pasta than a fusion Asian cuisine. Cheu Noodle Bars mission statement is providing their best authentic Asian noodle experience. Well, their dishes are overly salty and lack any kind of flavor whatsoever. They have utterly disgraced the Asian cuisine with their horrible fusion experimentation. The noodles i pop in my microwave are sadly better than the noodles I've tasted at Cheu. By the way, their pork belly buns are overrated. They're way too over cooked and lack seasoning. Overall, Cheu noodle Bar is a joke of a restaurant. It's basically just Olive Garden disguised behind a few Asian ingredients. Save yourself the time and money and find a noodle house in Chinatown. Shit, even instant ramen at your local supermarket is better."

The buns (mini burgers) were incredibly satisfying while also tasting quite original. While burgers are ubiquitous in our culture, these came across as fresh and unlike any other I've tried. The dumplings, while not as original, were just as satisfying. While these two appetizers really impressed me, the BBQ pig tails were easily my favorite of the 3 apps that we ordered. The meat fell right off the bone and was incredibly juicy. While we didn't try the famous garlic wings this time, they are surely on the radar for our next trip.\n\nThe entrees were excellent as well. My girlfriend got the brisket and I got the bolognasian. We felt both were excellent and ultimately agreed that the bolognasian was the stronger of the two. We are both fans of heartier tasting sauces.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, the atmosphere and service of this place was excellent.

The broth was separate from its components such that the noodles were al dente and when combined together, were just right. The brisket was very good. The dumpling filling (pork) was fresh and better than most.\n\nThe bad:\nThe broth was very underwhelming. It was certainly salty and savory enough, however, just left a lot to be desired. Considering the broth brings the whole dish together, I really couldn't get through it. The matzo ball addition to the soup seems forced to me, or, I'm just not a matzo fan. The dumplings were cooked well and the filling, as mentioned, was well done, however, the chili oil it was in lacked flavor.\n\nI think the rest of the menu seems interesting enough to try again, most likely in person. Noodle soup is probably best enjoyed at the restaurant, so this review may be a bit biased."

They always have a great selection of beers and switch up the menu to keep it fresh and seasonal. \nIn fact, it would be an easy 5 stars but I have it 4 because although I love the music and the vibe of the place, I always feel like they're trying to push me out the door. \nSo I guess if you're not trying to hangout and you want a super quick lunch, this is perfect. If you want a chill relaxing dinner, this isn't really your place. Also they don't have dessert - which I was old by a waiter was a conscious decision so that people don't stay any longer than they already do."

The meat was incredibly tender and paired wonderfully with the miso broth. One thing I didn't like was the egg. I was expecting a soft boiled egg, but the egg was just shy of being raw. The white part was still goopy and clear and most of it pretty much disintegrated into my broth. When I asked the waitress about it, she claimed that's how it's supposed to be.

And speaking of new flavors, the Ramen scene seems to have gained popularity in Philadelphia.\n\nSo, it's hard for me to dis on a place and especially Cheu since I love Ben Puchowitz's restaurant Matyson. I also really want to like Cheu because its ambience reminds of the BEST noodle bar in D.C. Toki. \n\nBut the ambience is all it has going for it right now, especially after being charged $14 for a large bowl of a minimal amount of noodles in my Cold Sesame noodle order.\n\nHow do you mess up Cold Sesame Noodles? And how do you warrant charging $14 for half the bowl of noodles? Was I paying for the ambience alone?\nI ordered Cold Sesame noodles on a really hot day in July thinking its your basic Asian meal, not too much can go wrong there and it won't break the bank. BOY was I wrong!\n\nFirst of all, the point of a noodle bar is overflowing noodles in your bowl not the other way around. And even though you don't want to stay authentic to a tradition of cooking ramen, the basics are still important. \n\nMy noodles were too al dente. The pork belly was a nice touch but if that was the reason for the $14 bill then no thank you. The kimchee cucumber on top covered with chili oil was a nice touch but it was poorly done,the kimchee lacked the original balance of just enough sourness to just enouph spice to give it its umph. Instead it was doused with chili oil that took away from the flavor of the noodles. And even though Laban praised this dish as close to authentic my authentic asian palette states otherwise.\n\nFor now I'll stick to the lesser of two evils and frequent the Ramen chain that is Terakawa. It's broth is on point and its noodles overflow the bowl. \n\nBen, a small suggestion, don't stray too far from traditional flavoring when your dealing with oriental cuisine and don't rush to add too many culinary delights to the menu before mastering what your \"noodle bar\" is named after."

I've never seen that before anywhere and as a bonus, it comes with a matzo ball!! \n\nDid it live up to the hype? Overall, yes--my favorite parts were the matzo ball and the brisket (in that order). I liked how the matzo ball was salty and contrasted with the noodles and broth. The brisket was tender and plentiful. However, I feel like they didn't mesh as well as the rest of the ramen as I expected. The noodles were well cooked but not particularly flavorful, so I felt like I had to have more soup with them to compensate. Towards the end, I started running of out soup. I also wasn't the biggest fan of the kimchi, as I usually like mine tart. The bigger complaint is that the kimchi tasted kind of like the broth, so I felt like it wasn't really adding anything different.\n\nI think my boyfriend's coconut curry noodles meshed better together as a cohesive bite, but I still enjoyed my brisket ramen.

I remember the first time we went to Toki (http://www.yelp.com/biz/toki-underground-washington?hrid=kHY3lSf2_8_Kz7fbNNQdQQ) together to get ramen. His proposal to go grab noodle soup was somewhat appalling but I really liked him so I didn't want to outright reject the idea. I was also pretty drunk so I went with it, heh. I ate some of the noodles and picked out a lot of the meat from the bowl that we shared. That was a big hint that he liked me too; if a man who loves meat as much as Justin does lets you steal all of his pork cheek, you must be special.\n\nNowadays Justin, ramen and I are like a happy but dysfunctional family. Ramen and I don't always get along but when we do, we really do, and Justin is the go between to make sure we get along. It's true love when Justin will find a way to go eat at a new ramen place without me as a taste test before he determines if I'll like it and can take me there. May sound odd but it means I don't have to eat gross food. I should have added \"boyfriend is a ramen taste tester\" to my list of things I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving.\n\nJustin and I had both researched where to eat in Philly and dinner on our first night was to be at Khmer Kitchen. However, our late lunch pushed dinner back a bit and when we arrived, just past 8:30pm, they had just stopped seating for dinner. We looked through our bookmarks and headed towards Cheu which wasn't too far away and was still open. Plus, it wasn't much further to Monk's which was our final destination for the evening. Even on a Friday night without reservations the wait wasn't too long. They actually quoted us a much longer wait time than it was and in the 15 or 20 minutes we waited on the bench outside the door we laughed at all of the people coming up expecting a table immediately. A bunch of normal people with a \"do you know who I am\" type of attitude annoyed that they couldn't immediately get a seat in a small highly rated restaurant. \n\nWe were seated at the counter right in front of the bar with adorable cartoon-decorated lamps above. We had a great view of the open kitchen and I was very impressed at how efficiently the two in the kitchen worked, and even more so that the chef was a woman (I don't understand why females are so underrepresented in the culinary world). Not only did the duo quickly put out good food that was well presented, but they did it all while managing takeout orders as well. Cheu is a bit too fusion-y for the type of ramen I like but the food was still decent. We ordered the daily dumplings (one type per day, four dumplings served in chili oil for $5). Not bad but I was still too full from lunch and was hoping that I'd like the ramen (ya know, since Justin hadn't tried it out for me yet) so I just ate one and gave my other one to Justin who happily finished it. Round two was the brisket ramen (with matzo ball, kimchi, sesame chili broth for $13). I think the dumplings ended up being the better part of the meal though since the matzo ball in the ramen was just texturally weird to me. The broth was well developed though and I think I'd like their product more if I'd had more traditional option. That being said, I'm rounding up from 3.5 stars because I get the sense that Cheu doesn't give a shit if people like their fusion food or not, they're gonna do what they want, and I respect that."

The food I guess is a type of Asian noodle shop/Jewish fusion. Really unique!\n\nWe ordered the beef and kimchi dumplings to start. I honestly didn't think these would be anything special, but I was pleasantly surprised. The sauce on it was unexpected and delicious. \n\nMy boyfriend went with the brisket and matzo ball ramen with soy marinated eggs and off a recommendation from the server I ordered the coconut curry noodle with lamb neck and egg. The brisket in the ramen was good, but overall not my favorite ramen. The broth was blander than what I'm used to with traditional Japanese ramen, but this is a fusion place so maybe shouldn't compare in that sense. \n\nBut the coconut curry noodles! I'm glad I listened to the server and went with this. If you love creamy coconut curry taste (and who doesn't?!) then you will love this. My boyfriend liked mine so much, even after I was done eating all the noodles he continued to drink the broth by itself!

Their Charred Corn is a messy, but inspired take on elote. I was surprised to see how well truffle oil paired with corn on the cob, although those who worship everything truffle probably just scoffed at such initial skepticism. And while I was hoping for bigger chunks of crab meat, my Cold Jade Noodle entree got better with every dash of sriracha, every chopstick-clasped peanut (the real winning taste here).\n\nCheu is a small, casual space that doesn't take reservations. We only waited maybe 15 minutes for a seat at the bar, but in that time, the staff let us place drink orders (the special was $4 Foster's 24 oz. \"oil cans\") and guzzle brews on the sidewalk. They had a great beer selection otherwise (Oskar Blues Mama's Little Yella Pils, 21st Amendment Watermelon Wheat, and Allagash Tripel, to name a few), but I opted for value pick this time around.

Wings were perfectly cooked and the levels of flavor each had their own unique character. The buns were interesting. The tops were a little burnt, mushroom was by far better than pork.

This was super annoying, Cheu--you need your staff to plan accordingly, or have the walks in wait for space to open, not inconvenience your guests.\n\nOur irritation was somewhat assuaged with an \"I'm sorry' salad. And it worked, somewhat. Because the perfectly ripe tomatoes, sweet watermelon, and homemade ricotta was a delicate combination of flavors and textures. The dumplings were perfectly cooked, though it was a small portion, the ramen with fall-off-the bone pork was flavorful, and the brisket matzoball soup was inventive, and was served in chili broth wit the perfect amount of spice. And the thai iced tea with rum is a fantastic idea and execution.\n\nI'm on the fence as to whether I'll go back--can get just as good food, some better, in Chinatown for much less. And no one at Nan Zhou or the choo choo place has never asked me to get up to accommodate another party. And I bet they never will. Might try lunch. Might not."

The wait can be a little daunting, but they take your name and call you when your table is ready, so you can go get a drink at bars nearby, and they even recommend some for you!\n\nWe sat at the counter and ordered the dumpling special of beef & ginger to start, followed by hand torn noodles with lamb neck and the miso ramen noodles with pork shoulder. \n\nThe dumplings were small, but tasty little bite sized bits of joy. They were doused in chili oil, but not so much so that it overwhelmed the dumplings, and the ginger flavor really packed a punch.\n\nThe hand torn noodles were amazing. I liken them to a version of Asian papardelle. The sauce was slightly sweet, so I spiced it up with some sriracha. The lamb neck pieces were mondo tender and super flavorful. The best part may have been the pickled mustard greens. They were super crunchy and had quite a kick from the vinegar that really cut through the richness of the noodles and sauce. I added a soft cooked egg to mine, and the runny yolk meshed well with the noodles as well.\n\nThe miso ramen may even have been better than the hand torn noodles. The broth was super tasty. The depth of flavor was insane. It hit on all levels, and definitely provided that umami euphoria. The pork shoulder was very flavorful and tender as well, and an egg always finishes off the noodle bowl nicely. \n\nI love watching the chefs work here and i love the atmosphere. Cheu does its own thing, and I love them for that. Place really is a treat and well worth the wait. Awesome food to warm you up during the cold."

It has a little tang to it, a good amount of onion taste, a pretty good crunch on the outside of the rangoon.\n\nI tried two types of noodles.  The miso ramen was my favorite.  It is served with the pork shoulder, black garlic, and soft egg.  I added vegetables to get a bit of green in there.  The broth was pretty good after I added some spicy stuff to the dish, it had a little bit of the texture that I like from miso broth.  \nI didn't like the brisket ramen as much as the miso, which surprised me after all of the praise for this dish.  The broth wasn't my favorite, I could have used a bit more heat and it has a bit too much of the tangy favor for my taste (perhaps it is a kimchi broth, but tangier than any kimchi jjigae that I've had).  Not bad, but I would prefer the miso.  The matzo ball was a pretty good texture with the soup.  I added egg and vegetable to this dish. \nFor both of the dishes, the noodles were not my favorite.  Slightly under cooked, past the mark of al dente \n\nI tried an interesting gose beer with my meal that I hadn't tried before.  It was a blood orange gose.  Not bad.  \n\nService was pretty quick and friendly. \n\nThis place gets packed pretty quickly.  There are only a few tables, with more seating at the bar.  \n\nI have wavered between three and four stars with this review, but I think three is more accurate when comparing it to some of the other ramen bars in philly (which Cheu is really is much more of fusion than actual ramen, so maybe the comparison is not entirely accurate, but I think that the miso ramen is fairly traditional)."

However I just had a poor take-out experience. Ordered the brisket and paid full price (13$) which isn't cheap and only got a small slice of brisket and no matzo ball which is honestly the whole reason I ordered it. Kind of a huge bummer when you walk 8 blocks to get some dinner and drop a bunch of money only to be disappointed and hungry. I don't understand how half the meal is forgotten, I'd like to think they check stuff like that. The times they got things right it was very good, though mistakes are getting more and more frequent and causing illness hunger, so I feel like I need to stop going as they also don't respond well to complaints I understand."

The inside is decorated with actual ramen on the wall, lights that have different drawings and string lights. I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food is here.  My date and I split the brussel sprouts and the tuna poke bowl. Their brussel sprouts are definitely the best brussel sprouts I've ever had!! They have some tasty tofu and kimchi served with it which really adds to the dish. The tuna poke bowl was fantastic. It tasted very fresh.  Their pickled cucumbers give some nice crunch and acidity to the dish. I've never had a soy egg before, but I really liked it. Cheu's portion sizes are great. If you're coming here on a date, I definitely recommend getting two dishes and splitting them. It makes it more fun! I will definitely be back to Cheu soon so I can try their vegetarian ramen!"

Cheu doesn't claim to be authentic Japanese food - what it does aspire to is something close to authentic but with dynamic variants and unique flavors. The hand-torn lamb bowl has succulent perfectly cook chunks of lamb neck and the dates bring a mild and very pleasant sweetness. I also tried miso ramen which I loved for its intense flavor. I can only say that I wasn't a huge fan of the watermelon ginger juice, but it was solid and the fact that they had something like that available made me content enough.

Their miso ramen with pork shoulder, sea beans, black garlic and soft poached egg was one of the tastiest ramen bowls I've had.

Everything was reasonably tasty.\nI opted to order pickup because there always seems to be people waiting for a seat outside...figured if I'm going to guarantee food before 8pm I better order it to go.\n\nThe folks in Cheu are incredibly nice and friendly. I felt a very warm atmosphere inside. The lighting was low, which is what I'd expect for dinner time but still on the dark side for me. The music was a tad loud for my taste during dinner but their taste in music was great...hip place, cool neighborhood find.\n\nNow the food. The pork belly bun was tasty, but the bun was grilled, so the texture was not the soft, luscious, pillowy bite I was hoping for. The pork itself was great. There was some kind of mayo sauce and pickles that added a nice texture and flavor. Next the kimchi. I should know better than to order kimchi EVER. No one makes kimchi as good as my mom. It was ok. I won't fault Cheu for kimchi because it was more an interpretation. Lovely presentation and as a cabbage side dish it was fine. The black garlic wings were good, but I wish they were saltier or spicier or something, just seemed to almost be right. The wings themselves were perfectly cooked though so I really appreciated the care they took.\n\nNow the mains. I tried both the ramen and the brisket (by the way, I didn't eat all of this myself, luckily I was ordering for others so I got to try a lot of things). The brisket is great. Definitely my favorite thing; perfectly cooked egg, right choice of noodles and lovely broth. Fall-apart brisket and matzo were perfect accompaniments. The ramen was good too. Not the best ramen I've had but I'm terribly spoiled with ramen. I think it was a good version, but not a rich and salty as I personally prefer.\n\nWould I eat here again? Yes! Do I recommend it? Yes! I have a tough palette to please, I love very spicy and salty foods, so when I eat \"Asian fusion\" fare, I'm generally quite displeased, but Cheu had some lovely elements and it is still a new place so I'd like to keep trying it to see how it develops over time."

        "text": "CHEU Noodle Bar\n\nI braved a blizzard. The like of one that has my feet in frozen agony as I sit in the preposterously small, cramped and busy restaurant, and it is a stretch to call it that. I was told to stand and wait by the wall as soon as I walked in so it wasn't exactly a warm welcome. I was seated eventually but was not greeted or asked if I had been there before or needed help with the menu. I got literally 10 seconds before I was asked what I wanted to order without offering me specials or suggestions. Judging by the state of the kitchen and how hard the chefs are working to keep up with the demand. The front of the house are doing a good job of ruining the business for them all on their own. In my haste I decided to try their buns. One of each of their four varieties. \nThe oyster one smelled funny. As if it wasn't the freshest oyster. The mushroom was pitiful and was not satisfying. A variety of mushrooms and more of it would have made a better mushroom bun. The pork belly was a bit of a let down as the fat wasn't rendered properly. It was fatty and flabby. Not very appetizing. The so called cheeseburger bun was the best of the buns. It tastes very much like a cheeseburger or a slider by the size. However, I felt it was not the best or most creative representation of Asian American fusion. \n20 minutes in. I put in another order of their most popular dish as recommended by the server following my questioning. I would have liked to have had my request for a smaller portion of the ramen considered as I am dining by myself and their ramen bowls are behemoth in size. However, I was declined without much thought.\nMay this bowl of ramen prove to be their saving grace. Because as of now I'm an unhappy customer that is not likely to return. \n7 minutes in.\nMy bowl of miso ramen arrives and immediately I feel discouraged and disheartened at the sight of the utterly undercooked egg. I dig in to taste the broth regardless. The broth is the key, the cornerstone of a decent ramen. Have a lacking broth and you might as well as close up shop and turn to exile.\nUnfortunately the broth is simply salty. Lacks any depth of flavor or complexity. A sodden shame.\nCHEU Noodle... You have ccertainly lost me as a cheuing customer."

We waited 10mins for a table and got seated right away. The service and inside are nice, I love the decorations, very unique and creative. However, the food, in my opinion, was not up to the hype. I may be more hard on Asian fusion restaurants especially cuz I'm Asian and grew up eating asian food, so I always feel skeptical about American- Asian restaurant. We ordered a lot for 2, dumplings (cheeseburger), garlic wings, pork belly bun, brisket noodle and spicy shrimp noodle.\n- Dumplings: pretty good, the filling are fresh and juicy, i like the crunchy quinoa on top.\n- Chicken: the breading is crunchy but not evenly coated with the sauce, and I don't think they marinated the chicken before deep frying it so it was very bland. (Yes I am a chicken critique, since I love em' so much) I think they tried to mimic Korean style soy garlic but the execution was way below the expectation, and I dont know how many reviews praised their chicken.\n- Pork belly bun: very much like Vietnamese Banh Mi, but the meat was not very well seasoned. And for 3 dollars, I could get a whole taste in south philly for a real Banh mi.\n- Brisket: the broth is like kim chi juice, and the brisket was very \"safe\"- steak like- not the fatty type you see in any Chinese or vietnamese noodle place. I was excited to try the hand drawn noodle and i think it was a mistake. The noodle was very soft and weird shaped, and I couldn't eat them after a bit. Mayb if I kept the original noodle that come with it I would be more satisfied.\n- Spicy shirmp: not that spicy, and it was a little sour flavor, much like sweet and sour thin soup, but not yet that level. I loveee the shrimp balls and I think they were the best out of the meal. Very tasty and flavorful.\nOverall a nice experience, with the service and decor. But I may not coming back cuz I'm more of a foodie, and Sampan is definitely my number one Asian fusion place right now."

While I knew this would be 'Asian fusion'--and that I shouldn't expect traditional Ramen--I still left both disappointed and, frankly, disgruntled.\n\n1) The wait: I get it. It was a Friday night, the place was poppin and as Prof Roger K wrote, \"exotic fares were being prepared.\" But we waited an hour and a half. What. While that was not a deal breaker for me at all, albeit a minor inconvenience, what proceeded next was the worst...\n\n2) The service: So, after waiting for an hour+ (and by the way neither of us were upset at this point) we were stuffed at the bar, despite a table for two clearly being open and already cleaned. The hostess rudely tossed down the menu and walked away. Awesome. Despite the chilly welcome, despite another couple after us getting seated at the open table, we were still eager to try the food and proceeded to order the Black Garlic Wings, Brisket noodles, and hand torn noodles. Not a bad selection, we thought. \n\n3) The food: In fact, the wings took about 10 minutes to arrive and they were spot on delicious. No complaints there. Both sweet and tangy, they had a nice crunch to it without being overly fried. We ordered another round of drinks, happier, much more optimistic than before; after all, maybe someone just pissed in the hostess's cheerios. But then came the next round of\n\n4) The wait: Forty minutes went by. Forty. 4-0. I timed it (I had on my handy calculator wrist watch; and, yes, they still make them). At this point, I was starving. No, literally: I felt my stomach involuting. I was probably catabolizing all my muscle mass at this point. After forty minutes went by, after watching other couples who arrived after us get their food--the same order, FYI--my husband finally got his Brisket noodles. Slightly salty, but not mad. Ha, the noodles, not us. 'We have food now; this isn't so bad. Okay, well, at least one order,' I thought. But no, once his ramen came then came another round of\n\n5) The wait: Yes, folks, it did not end there. Another twenty minutes rolled by without me getting anything: nary a peek at my food nor an explanation from the waitress/hostess/staff/kitchen. Just side-eyes from the surrounding tables, people wondering why my husband was guiltily eating while I had nothing in front of me. Finally, I took about ten deep breaths and calmly asked the waitress about the status of my order. Not only did she snap back at me with something exquisitely curt and snarky she went on to gossip/complain about me to the hostess. Before you think I'm delusional and semi-paranoid a la Remi Malek from Mr Robot, there was no need for me to deduce or even speculate that they were talking about me since they did it right. in. front. of. me. No secrets there, people. It was within earshot. Pretty clear, if you ask me. \n\nI know what you're thinking at this point, and, yes, I am crazy enough to be spending this much time writing a review; yes, I have dedicated thirty minutes of my life, time that I will never get back, to let you know the context in which I received my mediocre bowl of not-worth-it noodles; and yes, I can't believe I wrote a veritable war treatise on this place, what the heck am I thinking; \n\nbut no, I am not ever, ever, ever crazy enough to go back to that place and re-hash the hipster hell that was Cheu Noodle. Ever. Because at the very least I am sane enough to recognize that the hostess/waitress was very much like my noodles that night: frigid. And a bit salty.\n\n\n**UPDATE 10/22/15** The owner of Cheu Noodle reached out to me regarding my review and was very kind and extremely professional. While I was not impressed with my initial experience there, he really went above and beyond."

The contents went well with each other, but in hindsight, I wished I had ordered the cold noodles instead. This yakisoba is more suitable for the cold weathers. At the end of my meal, I was perspiring. (To be fair, I think the air conditioner could've been turned higher. It was a 90 degree day and the restaurant was overly warm.)

Dimly lit, clean, I hope they can expand in the future.\n\nLOCATION: Somewhat hard to find as they have a small front end and a small sign hanging. Look for the black paint and red trim. Street parking, but I recommend walking.\n\nSERVICE: It was friendly, but do to some awkward seating arrangements it took them a while to seat me. I was placed at the corner of the bar on the end where people had to pass to get to the bathroom. The path was between my seat and a small table with 4 people. The person sitting at that table with their back on that path was constantly interrupted by passerbys. I was also interrupted multiple times. Maybe cut out that bar seat or only seat 3 at that table?\n\nFOOD: I got your typical ramen and it was just that. This was very plain and nothing unique about it. The broth was not elevated in any way. The slices of beef could have been more tender. I did however enjoy the kimchi they added.\n\nPRICING: It was fairly priced. $9-11/bowl. They had other small dishes that I should've tried, maybe next time."

The service is efficient and friendly. The tables are packed in, but this doesn't take away from the experience. The menu is small, which reassures you that you can't go wrong no matter what you decide to order.\n\nDuring my first visit, I went with the pork belly bun, and the Brisket ramen. Delicious. During my second, I got Yakisoba 2.0 because I can't not get a dish that involves radishes. The ramen portions are such that I can actually finish them in one sitting without feeling stuffed. All of the food looks beautiful when it's served (#eatingfortheinsta). \n\nI can't think of anything more I would want out of a noodle place, or any place for that matter. I'll come back again and again, especially for their ever changing specials."

Recently, I had the opportunity to visit this establishment again, and it was as great as the first time! My dish of choice? Miso ramen with extra pork belly.\n\nSeating is somewhat limited, as the location is rather small, however if you get a chance to visit Philly, this is definitely a must try!\n\nWell done Cheu Noodle Bar! 4-stars!

Kind of steep for one person! I know I'm pinching pennies here, but I think Terrakawa runs around $11 and it actually does kind of make a difference - esp when I wouldn't say that this is THAT much better than Terrakawa, if at all. \n\nThe good - the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente, much appreciated. The egg was also perfectly soft and runny on the inside  --( don't except the soft boiled egg) keep in mind this WAS perfectly cooked. They don't go for the traditional Japanese ramen, that's not their concept. So I loved it for what it was! The broth was a little sweet for my liking, maybe a personal preference but I like it a tad more savory and salty\n\nOverall takeaway? I don't doubt for one second that they make pretty darn good food, but there's a bit of a price tag on it. $10 for wings ( which I've heard are phenomenal) , $5 for some wontons, and I forget the price on the pork or mushroom buns. I think I'll come back with a partner and split it next time. You will be REALLY full from ramen, I had to stuff it. I'd be happier splitting and trying more items next time!\n\n** Also, this place only seats 24 people so either be ready to wait, or come right when they open for lunch at 12!!

This to me is such a minor point but when a place is teetering on the brink of greatness it matters, IMHO! What didn't I like about the dishes? Well, when I was in college I was in a fraternity and we were too cheap and rowdy to have nice things so all of our meals used these cheap awful plastic cups, and when I ordered my $8 drink, it arrived in one of these horrid little vessels. I also abhor those cheap, wooden, break-apart chopsticks used in take out Chinese places, and when I ordered my $15-$20 bowl of wheat noodles with an egg in it, I was expected to eat it with the awful take-out chopsticks. Needless to say after dropping 100 bones on myself and my two guests, I was a little more than pissed off that I spent that on cheap noodles with cheap egg, served with bottom of the barrel utensils, and frat boy cheap glassware. For the profit margin this place has I expect a better investment in the experience/ambiance/decor and I for that reason I am not excited to go back in the near future. \n\nI will say that I did give them four stars, because aside from the insulting, cheap-at-the-expense-of-the-customers-experience, masquerading as 'hipster' dishware, The place actually did have some talent when it comes to combining flavors. The Miso Ramen was really good and flavorful, and I was told they started as a wing place so I ordered the black pepper wings, and I must say they were to die for. Best wings I've ever had. \n\nCome to think of it, if they quadrupled the wing quantity and greatly lowered the price I'd give them five stars and come back every week. LOL."

Daily specials to your left when you walk-in, for beer, dumplings, etc.  Hostess is right there, mine was very friendly and offered to take our number and call us when a table opened (15 minute wait on a Monday @ 7 p.m.).\n\nOrdered the wings, which our waitress informed us were voted best in Philly.  If they were voted most unique, I would buy it.  They have a very unique taste given the preparation (black garlic (?), seeds), but I thought the meat quantity lacked a bit and was just a tad too breaded.  I would still recommend, and for $9 I think there is value there but best in Philly is a stretch.\n\nThe ramen was insanely good.  I allowed the waitress to pick, and she ordered me what I assume is the standard version on the menu - Miso ramen with pork shoulder and an egg.  Wowzers....incredible flavor, portion size was great (for $13), pork shoulder was absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared.  I cannot say enough good things.  My buddy got the same but added pickled jalapeno and pork belly, he shared my opinion....supremely good stuff.\n\nGot some drinks as well, I had the bourbon with mint which was really refreshing, light on the booze though....\n\nNet, highly recommend, if it were healthy food would be here once a week for sure."

I've studied their menu before arriving and knew what I wanted to try out. \n\nI decided to get the Sichuan Fat Spicy noodles - it was a bit bland and dry (I had to pour Sriracha sauce to give it more flavor). Really nothing special in my opinion. There was a decent amount of tofu in there but I wouldn't get this dish again - it was $12-13 when I could've gone somewhere in Chinatown to get something way tastier. \n\nFor lunchtime, they do offer for an extra $4 to your bowl - apps. \n\nMy friends and I got different apps. I got the wings (I would recommend getting again) Yelpers weren't kidding with how tasty the wings are. It's sweet and tangy. But you get 3 pieces (be warned) the bigger size is 6 pcs for $10\n\nWe got the Rangoon and the pastrami dumplings (the dumplings are steamed - not fried) - my thoughts on these were okay, they were tasty. I'd recommend you try at least one of these apps or all. \n\nHonestly, the ramen choices didn't entice me enough to want to get it. I looked at their dishes on their IG page because there weren't enough recent photos on Yelp. And I read a few reviews saying they're either amazing or very salty and saying don't bother. Yea, I read some mixed reviews so I decided to go safe with the fat noodles which weren't good in my opinion. \n\nI've had ramen before in NYC and it was too salty for my taste. I prefer a simple ramen - not where a whole bunch of stuff is added in it (the matzo ball sounded interesting) but it didn't win me over. I'm sure you could maybe alter your ramen noodles? A question to ask the waiter. \n\nMy overall thoughts - I wouldn't come back but I would say, def try this place out and see for yourself! Be your own judge and be reminded of the price - it's pricey for an Asian fusion restaurant. Expect to pay $12+ also, the menu does change from time to time and they have specials too at times (but they keep the staple dishes)"

Anywhere else we moved put us on top of diners trying to eat their meal or in the way of staff.

The soup definitely had the consistency of a normal ramen soup (rather than the creaminess of a curry) and tasted like a normal ramen soup with some curry spice thrown in. The coconut taste was perceptible but not a distinctive element of the dish. The noodles were cooked well, and the overall combination of ingredients was good but not super interesting. However, the inclusion of fried rice noodles was problematic in my opinion, as they became soggy almost immediately and thus detracted from the dish. Most disappointingly, the soy-marinated egg add-on only came with 1/2 of an egg. Considering how one must pay extra for the egg, I would at least expect one egg, as opposed to a fraction.

Unfortunately this option did not come with eggs, which I had to add 2 of to my liking. I also added additional pork shoulder as well. Now, as for how the ramen actually was? ... Less than stellar. To say the least, the broth was a let-down & lacked any sort of kick like I was expecting it to (is it red chili broth or no?). Though the beef brisket & pork shoulder were actually quite good along with the matza ball which sucked up the broth nicely like a sponge, the noodles were also somewhat of a let down as well. They were a little too rubbery (not soft enough) & as such, this led only to dampen the overall taste of such. \n\nMom ordered Sichuan Spicy Fat Noodles for her dish. I found the noodles to be more enjoyable in that dish since they were done well & the texture of such was much more palatable & pleasing to taste. However, it also lacked spiciness as such advertised in the name of the dish.\n\nAll in all, a most okay place to go for ramen. There are better place around (I'm looking at you, Terakawa) & I personally don't have much inclination to come & try this place's ramen again although I wouldn't be opposed to should one of my friends be interested. That being said, this place's ramen is only mediocre & as such, I just consider it middle of the road since such did have some positives. Keep up the improvement of ramen here if possible.

I knew it'd be tiny but we're talking 4 tables and a counter and there were 4 of us trying to eat. They estimated the wait as best they could and to our surprise, 10 mins later, we were seated at the only 4 top. A noodle bar miracle!\n\nWhat we ordered:\nBroccoli with thai sausage- loved this. \nFried chicken and pork belly buns- to my surprise, I liked the chicken better though both were pretty tasty and had a yummy pickled cucumber slaw on top that totally added great crunch. \nDumplings in chili oil- definitely good but I love Han Dynasty's more.\nThe Black Garlic Wings- the winner. Totally lived up to the hype. The were huge, crispy and delicious.\nBBQ pig tails- these were also great. I loved the sauce. It was sweet! \nNoodle dishes-\nRamen \nBrisket\nBoth of the noodle dishes were very good though I would have liked a little more depth of flavor with the broth. I also thought that the meat in each were a tad overcooked to my liking BUT that being said, i enjoyed both. I think I found myself being a little more critical of the noodle dishes since, well, it's a noodle bar. \n\nTo sum up, I was totally thrilled with my Cheu's experience. Everything was really tasty and I really enjoyed. For my next visit, I'll likely go with no more than two people...I doubt I'll ever be as lucky to get a table as the first visit again. Something to consider."

My boyfriend and I have tried to get seated in this place for four times now, and we finally got seated at the bar on an early Monday night. We got the wings, which were reasonably seasoned. Except not well enough for you to taste the seasoning in the actual chicken meat. My boyfriend got the Miso Ramen and I got the Brisket Ramen, which both had pretty decent broths and was enjoyable. The downside to both of our ramen were that their was very LITTLE broth in the bowl. I've never had a bowl of noodle soup in which I had to fish for the broth. I mean, ?!?! Anyway, the bean sprouts in the miso ramen was not cooked, which was a bit of a disappointment as it usually is in a bowl of ramen. The pork shoulder was tasty, but a bit too sweet and salty. For the brisket ramen, the brisket was not seasoned at all, and the SLABS of meat should have been thinner. Not exactly sure what a big soft ball of mush was doing in my bowl, since it was bland. And the entire dish was cold."

I respect their original approach to ramen as opposed to (falsely) claiming authenticity.\n\nThat is why my comps are not Sumire (Sapporo), Santoka (Asahikawa) or Ajiyoshi (Sendai) ... Ippudo's Akamaru (if you call that miso).\n\nOut of the gate, let me say that this is probably my favorite place for ramen in Philly. You are probably wondering then, why only 3 stars? Well, here's the breakdown:\n\nNoodles: Classic Sapporo - Nishiyama style. Textured, thicker noodle with sodium carbonate additive. Noodles were cooked appropriately.\n\nSoup: Clean, uncomplicated, single animal broth...perhaps chicken? Miso used was uninteresting.\n\nSo here's the tough part - \"balance\". The classic Nishiyama noodle was developed to pair with a heavy tonkotsu centric Sapporo miso style developed in the 1950's. The balance between the soup x noodles is just not there.\nNext - \"miso\". I do understand that artisan miso is hard to get in the US, but using so-so meee-so makes it a disappointing experience.\n\nNOTE FOR OTHER YELPERS.\n1. Real kimchee gets the sour taste from fermentation.\n2. Sprouts and egg are NOT supposed to cook through. This ain't pho."

Matzo in ramen is perfect with a nice thick but of brisket that falls apart with chopsticks. Did I mention that the matzo ball was light and tender?\n\nThe broth.... Oh the broth. The nectar of the gods is one description another is balanced perfection that the pundits would term Umami. Screw them.

So when his stomach started rumbling Sunday late afternoon I suggested we check out Cheu's menu so that I didn't have to rush to cook dinner. The place was packed and it was only 5pm, which clearly spoke to the quality of the food.\n\nA quick peek at the menu and we were ordering their Miso Ramen (pork shoulder, egg, sea beans, black garlic) and Hand Torn Noodles (lamb neck, pickled mustard greens, dates) to share together. The two large bowls came out pretty quickly, and we dove right in, chopsticks eagerly grasping at noodles thick and thin. One bite in my husband declared that these were the best noodles he's had from a ramen place in Philly (or any other noodle dish, for that matter). The flavors in both dishes were superb - the roasted meats were tender and juicy, the noodles had just the right amount of bite. In the lamb dish, the pickled greens gave a great bright flavor contrast to the smokier flavors. Both were hearty and enough for the two of us, although the other dishes were very tempting. We'll be back another time for sure - he's hooked on those noodles now!"

Everything is always delicious!\n\nThe ramen is a classic staple made here. All ingredients are fresh and perfectly paired with one another. It's also fun to watch them put this dish together - so much care is put into the presentation, too.\n\nThe dumplings are also a highlight on the menu. Three little dumplings are served with chili oil and stuffed with whatever ingredients they are serving for the day - the combinations are awesome. I had a pork and pickle one a while back, it was divine!\n\nOther great appetizers are the black garlic wings and the bbq pig tails.

I was in the mood for Asian and Cheu's dumplings and ramen pictures had me salivating. Sure enough I made my way over there. They had a nice crowd. The place was fairly small, hip and trendy. They offered a great selection of beers. I sat at the bar, my waiter greeted me and offered some of their special of the day. I ended up with the miso ramen and beef and cilantro dumplings. The dumplings came out first, really nice presentation. There was 4 dumplings and after trying 1 I could say that they need to work on the dumpling's skin because it was too thick and floury, the beef was dry, and the hot oil overpowered the delicate dumplings. Then my big bowl of miso ramen came out and the broth was good, creamy, thick, dense but after awhile it became a little salty. I didn't like how the pork had a cha siu flavor and it was also shredded, it was a little too bbq for the miso ramen. Also their egg is pouched and not completely cooked so when you poke into it, the egg yolk ran all throughout the broth which is something I did not like. All in all, this place is a very American inspired ramen bar. I probably will not be back for a second visit. I prefer Terakawa Ramen in Chinatown just because I feel like their ramen is definitely more authentic than Cheu's."

I had ordered Rangoon samosas and spicy Sichuan noodles. The samosa (fried dumplings) were very good to my surprise. It is served over some sweet jelly which at first struck as a bit odd. The flavors very well balanced and I have to say, this was very good. The spicy Sichuan noodles on the other hand were too salty and after a few bites, I couldn't feel my tongue due to the spicy. This doesn't mean that the food was poorly prepared; maybe it wasn't what I expected. This the 4 stars. I would definitely recommend you check it out.\n\nThe interior is decent. It is not a place for groups to go. I liked the small place, cozy eating set-up at the bar. There are a few tables.\n\nThe service was pleasant. They checked on me often and were very polite.

If you like spice, there is crushed red pepper and sriracha on the table, which I do. My bf had the Brisket Ramen that he liked, but thought there could have been more brisket.

Loved that drink and resisted ordering a third. \n\nI tried the brisket noodles, which had a matzoh ball and kimchi within. The eclecticness of the dish appealed to me. I liked the dish a lot although having two starches--noodles and matzoh ball competing didn't make conceptual sense. But I liked having a bonus--matzoh ball--and it was delicious."

We were able to snag 4 seats at the bar in less than 10 minutes on a Sunday evening.  This service was spectacular and the beer options were just right.\n\nI ordered the coconut curry and LOVED it.  I was worried about it being too spicy, but I made a simple request to the kitchen to go light on the heat, and it came out perfect.  My boyfriend ordered the Shoyu ramen on special and it was fantastic as well.  We definitely plan to hit this place up again before we head back to home to Las Vegas."

Haven't been to a noodle bar in months since I was at naruto in ny which was awesome.  This place is small but the table turnover is quick so the wait isn't that long.  We got a Rivertown Greatful white beer while waiting which was good then got seated not long after.  The table we got was the closest to the door n we were greeted by server who gave us the special item of the day - Szechuan type green beans.  Then after she walked away another server came up to give us the specials but he stopped once we told him we already were informed lol.  We ordered the black garlic wings to start which were ok..I expected fried wings for sum reason but they were ok...the pork bun n cheeseburger buns were next which good but nothing compared to the ones at Momofuku...they are sliders n the bun is a biscuit tasting bun which is good but was disappointing going from the cheeseburger bun which was ok slider size to the pork bun which was like a subway sandwich which in my mind blows cos it's all bread n no filling...the pork is good but they need to triple the portion size...the brisket matzo ball ramen was good but not excellent.  With kimchi being in there I expected n wanted it to be spicy but it wasn't.   My friends beans were good but she would of preferred a ramen bowl instead.  The other thing would be that it took a bit for a server to come back when we were ready to leave n this made us late for the show. I do wish I tried the dumplings and maybe I will if I go back but first impression doesn't live up to the good reviews I've glanced at"

There you can watch the three chefs at work and gaze up at the interesting art lamps above your head. If that's not enough to occupy you look behind you and you can see \"ramen art\" just below a mural. \n\nThe menu is split into smaller plates and noodle bowls. For starters, our favorites are the dumplings (usually some type of brisket with dates/and or nuts), the BBQ pig tails, and the charred brussels. The fish \"ribs\" we tried were so-so. As far as the noodle bowls go, make sure to try the homemade hand torn noodle bowl with lamb neck, pickled mustard greens, and dates. It's really good. My wife likes the brisket bowl with the matzo ball, kimchee, and sesame broth but not being a ramen fan, I will stick to my hand torn noodles. \n\nThe cute, energetic waitress is great, the staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly. The only negatives are that if you order a lot of food it can get a bit pricey and they don't open up until 1 PM on Saturdays for lunch. But absolutely worth a visit.\n\nOh. I forgot. You gotta check out the bathroom (specifically the sign in it). Even if you don't have to go."

What is extraordinary about Ricker is he spent a lot of time in Thailand and learned all the subtle nuances to Thai cooking and methods. There is something to be said about learning another culture's cuisine.\n\nThe broth in the ramen noodle dish was flat. That in my opinion is one of the worst things with food. The broth is THE glue - the singular thing that pulls all the other mundane ingredients together.

The fun part of sitting at the bar is watching all the food being cooked right in front of you! \n\nThe black garlic wings are a must try. They are crispy and savory, perfect starter to split between 2 people. I ordered the coconut curry noodle bowl and added shrimp balls. The coconut broth was delicious. I was apprehensive about \"shrimp meatballs\" but they were so good I couldn't even tell they were shrimp! My friend ordered the brisket bowl which was also delicious, the brisket was very tender.

        "text": "\"Do you want pork belly with that?\" Your answer should always be an emphatic \"YES,\" and you'll get asked that question multiple times if you don't already put it on your ramen! I first saw this restaurant on a TV show hosted by an NY Times food writer who was giving a \"million-dollar review\" and he was trying a bunch of Philly restaurants. This was one he really loved, so I went there on that recommendation alone. Not disappointed and have been back a bunch of times. \n\nI usually get seated at the counter, which I prefer because I enjoy watching the kitchen. This is cozy, however, so if you don't like bar stools and potentially touching your fellow diners in another party, ask for a table. I always start with a whiskey-based cocktail here--they've got a great menu--and then I often get their wings and a side of Brussel sprouts. I've actually gone and NOT gotten ramen! And that's ok--these sides an apps are so amazing I don't miss the ramen, and sometimes my companions' eyes are bigger than their stomachs and I get some ramen too! Back to the pork belly: melt in your mouth deliciousness. The pork belly appetizer is sick--so, so good--and they are generous with the belly they put on the ramen. But the ramen I've had that I like best is the curry ramen. It's got a warm heat and is really soothing on a chilly day. Everyone I've taken here has been blown away by the satisfying blend of flavors in one bite: sweet, salty, sour, tangy--umami every time. \n\nThe only downside is this place is so popular (kudos, guys!) that the wait can sometimes be too long for me, and they don't take reservations. If you persevere, it's completely worth it. Or, just go early on a week night and enjoy!"

        "text": "Ever since their grand opening on April Fools Day, I've been working towards tasting all the items on their menu and here's what I got:\n\nThe menu is divided into three sections, Goodies, Snacks and Noodles. Noodles are self-explanatory, Goodies are smaller plates, Snacks are slightly larger with more cooking and designs involved. Upon ordering, you'll receive a plate of crushed Shin Ramyun which reminded me of my childhood where we would open a packet of instant noodles, crush them in the bag and sprinkle in the seasoning and shake the hell out of it. \n\nTo save everybody's time, I'm just going to rank the dishes from my favorite to my least favorite and write a small excerpt about what I like and dislike about them:\n\nSnacks\n\nBBQ Rice Cakes - It tasted exactly like a Chinese street food, steam and fry rolled out noodles smothered with hoisin sauce and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. It's chewier and they added vegetables. It's hearty and nostalgic.\n\nBuns - Pork Belly is a must-have, it's sweet and melt-in-your-mouth succulent. Mung bean is like a nicely done falafel. The burger is also quite nice.\n\nBroccoli - slightly overcooked but I like the glaze, nothing special about the vietnamese sausage but the speck of meat is certainly welcomed. All the peanuts sunk to the bottom. Maybe if the peanuts are more finely ground, they might stick to the broccoli better.\n\nWings -  The shishito pepper are not too spicy and wings have a tender crust to them. Wings provide a good meaty balance to your entire meal.\n\nEggplant - They look cute with the mixture of bulb and medallion shapes. The tamarind is a bit less luster. Not enough flavor, I prefer the traditional miso preparation.\n\nGoodies\n\nScrapple - It was quite awesome with the little crunch, it's like the taro or turnip cake you get at dim sum restaurants. It's a great dish.\n\nPickles - Love the different pickles, baby turnip, cucumber and tamarillo (?). They look awesome and tasted good and crunchy. \n\nGarlic Greens - The first time I had them they were baby bok choy and were limp, flavorless and soggy. Second time, they were made with baby chinese broccoli and they tasted right and was an awesome side dish.\n\nSweet & Sour Cucumber - it's like pickles but with sesame oil.\n\nKimchi - My companion liked it, it was not very spicy and the taste of fermentation is a bit too strong in comparison.\n\nDumplings - The skin is too thick, can't taste much of the inside. Lack flavor.\n\nNoodles\n\nCold Sesame - It's sweet and bright with the crunch of the cucumber. It's a great noodle dish. I wish there were more in my bowl but if you're ordering this, you should avoid ordering the sweet and sour cucumber. \n\nBrisket - This is a great balance dish, the whole dish tasted like the beef brisket noodle soup that you can find in regular chinese noodle house. the soft-boiled eggs enriches the broth and rounded out the flavor of the slightly spicy chile broth. Lemongrass and five-spice (?) perfumes the whole dish. The matzo lends substance.\n\nLamb Neck - Love the lamb, love the hand torn noodles, the pickled mustard green is a little sharp but it's a good variety on the noodles menu.\n\nDuck Pho - The argument goes that this is not pho because it is not. Pho is that white stringy rice noodles. if the dish does not contain that type of noodles, then it is not Pho. However the spirit of pho is in this dish with sliced of raw duck with the fixins. I just wish the broth is stronger to counteract the duck. Love the foie gras meatballs but at the same time I wish there is a more satisfying bite of meat of not just slices and tiny meatballs.\n\nPork Ramen - Love the pork, love the sea beans, too bad there were only slithers of meat. It's too little and lack substance. \n\nCoconut Curry - It lacks something like beef or seitan. My bowl of coconut ramen only had a few melting cubes of squash, a few peanuts, the sauce and ramen. It's not much at all. \n\nMost of the dishes here have a sweet taste to it or are accompanied by a sweet sauce, I wish there are things like a salt and pepper squid or plain old meatballs to break things off. The portion is really quite small, you pretty much have to get a snack, a goodie and a bowl of noodles in order to get full. It's also quite pricey at $1.5-$2 a bite. The place is quite small and there is a 30-45 minutes wait after a certain time. If you are real hungry, you might want to go to another place nearby but service here impeccable. There's a general good vibe here and I love the music and the mural."

Brisket was solid too, and fell apart in your mouth.

All other ramen- by default- will never measure up to Ippudo's Hakata style ramen.  Ever. That said, I also realize that since I don't live in NYC, access to Ippudo is limited and therefore I must find other options that are geographically more appealing.  I used to live in Japan and have eaten at the ramen shacks along the train station. I am serious about ramen. \n\nSometimes I don't like creativity when it comes to certain foods. For example, don't try to gourmet my black beans and rice.  Not necessary and borderline blasphemous. I felt the same way about ramen until I had Cheu's Miso Ramen and Brisket Ramen.  Those two non-Asian boys have taken the simplicity of Japanese ramen and given it a Jewish twist that actually works! The Brisket Ramen is delicious, creative, and like two interracial lovers, the pairing is beautiful and natural. The Miso Ramen- one of my favorites- was delicious as well.  \n\nThe pork buns shocked me because of the bread- but, that English muffin thing works! One thing that I have not ventured to try is the Fish Bones.

It cost almost $13 and it was 4/5ths rice,  soggy tasteless big slices of zucchini that were totally inappropriate for a rice bowl, no more than five teeny pieces of chicken and a teeny bit of sauce. That was it! And for $13! WHat a complete rip off. It had no taste and was not good at all. They no longer have the mushroom noodle dish which was really not bad, but only after I learned to ask them not to immerse the entire dish in way too much canola oil (they say it was blended oil, but who knows what that means other than the cheapest most disgusting oil you can use - canola oil). \n\nI will never again go there. It was such a rip off I really feel offended.  Don't let them steal your money!"

I am not a huge ramen fan, but Cheu has somehow converted me.\n\nI recommend splitting one appetizer and one main dish between two people. \n\nAs an appetizer, go for the wings or dumplings. They just changed their menu up for the spring/summer, and the improved dumplings are phenomenal.\n\nFor your main, the brisket ramen and miso ramen are my go-to dishes, but you may want to go with something else during hot weather.\n\nCON: The wait here on any day of the week can be upwards of an hour. Don't go here hoping to get seated right away. You can expect to put your name down and have a drink either outside or down the block at Varga Bar while you wait. Alternatively, just call in and order pickup - it's almost as good."

Cheu fills a niche that bridges Asian tastes with Western ideology, a bar hangout that provides...ramen and pork buns?\n\nTonight, I saw Cheu, with its colorful decor and limited seating as the carefree younger brother to UC's Ramen Bar. Ramen Bar tries so hard to be authentic and excel for its Tiger Mom, it was a relief to walk into a Asian joint that just things hang loose. And it is because of these non-existent standards that allows Cheu to get away with their nontraditional menu.\n\nThe pork and burger buns were surprisingly petite yet satisfying, and the takes on broccoli and BBQ rice cakes seemed to be lifted straight out of a Food Network competition. The pork ramen is a mix and match that just works: chewy hand drawn noodles + melt in your mouth pork + crunchy greens + liquid poached egg = balance and possibly perfection.\n\nCheu, in its first week has ironed out kinks that usually takes other restaurants months to work out. Attentive service and good food straight out the starting gate earns this place your patronage at least once.\n\nStuck-up Asians need not apply."

I feel like at a very basic level a noodle bar should probably make their own noodles, and they don't.\nFor $12 or $13 bucks for a bowl of soup, the serving and product just doesn't wow me.  There are countless places in Chinatown that serve far superior broth and noodle soups for half the price.\n\nThat being said, I did enjoy the brisket and liked the combo of Jewish/Asian fusion.  I get that they are doing a fusion and it's not traditional, but then it should at least be outstanding.\n\nFor $20-$30 a person with drinks to eat here, I just don't get the hype."

I popped by Cheu Noodle Bar the first week to see if it was worthy of adding to my regular eating rotation. I really wanted to like this place. When my wife and I walked in, the decor was modern, fresh, and clean. The background music was well chosen and added to the hip ambiance. \n\nIn terms of the food, it could really use some work both in terms of taste and pricing. We started out with the Broccoli and peanut appetizer which was actually quite tasty. Unfortunately the portion was minuscule and was finished in nearly three bites. For a $7 broccoli appetizer, I'm expecting a little more product on the plate. I mean how much does  broccoli cost now a days anyway? If you walked a few blocks down the street, you could get some calamari or a tasty salad at Kanella BYOB for $8. \n\nFor the next course, we both tried the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup. It was a decent sized bowl of soup but the broth lacked the depth and character of other Pho soups that we've tried. The meat also had a bit too much fat that needed to be picked off before being consumed. You can have the same sized bowl of soup at Pho 75 (BYOB) on Washington Ave. for a mere $5.75 versus the $13 we paid at Cheu. \n\nOn a positive note, the service was friendly and the owners and servers were very interested in making sure that you had everything you needed. I just couldn't stomach paying over $40 for 2 bowls of soup and some broccoli. \n\nFrom reading these reviews, I see that I'm in the minority, but I just feel like these ratings are padded or something. I mean I'm no statistics major, but take a look at the \"ratings distribution\" it just seems a bit abnormal. April and May the reviews were mixed and averaged out to 3 starts. In June the ratings went through the roof... go figure?"

My only critic is a little sour cream or creme fresh would go amazing with it! \n\nSecond we got their wings and were blown away by the crisp moist texture and the amazing punch in the face flavor.

I recently read the Sun Noodles article on Eater and saw that Cheu Noodle was one of their customers so I finally said to myself we are going. \n\nWe rolled in on a Saturday mid-day not too long after Cheu opened (they open at noon on Saturdays). There were a few people already in the place but since it's so small to begin with it doesn't take much to fill it up. We opted to sit a the counter and have a view of the small kitchen and watch the chefs work. Pretty cool as usual. We started off with the special dumplings which were beef and black bean, you get 4 to an order and they are awesome! They come soaked in a little bit of chili oil so they have a little bit of spice but not too much, I was so happy to start off this way. Next we ordered a pork belly and cheeseburger bun. For those of you that have been to Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC, you know that they do steamed buns, Cheu does grilled buns so they are different but not in a bad way, in a good way. The buns were a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the pork belly was perfect. \n\nThe main event involved the Miso Ramen which came with pork shoulder but I also added pork belly and we did the cold sesame noodles with shrimp. Both were stellar, the noodles were ridiculous of course and the broth was divine, that was my favorite part. I have to say that in my opinion Cheu's ramen beats Noodle Bar's hands down. The soft boiled egg was perfect and the pork shoulder was awesome. The cold noodles were equally as good and overall it was a fantastic meal. \n\nWe will be heading back soon, but if you are going on the weekends get there before 1:30ish because when we drove by later on there were about 15 people standing outside waiting."

We sat down at the long bar and got to watch the chefs do their thing right in the middle of the restaurant. The ramen mural running along the wall was great, as was all the decorations hanging from the rafters and the collage stuck on the wall. The beer list is incredibly impressive and INCREDIBLY affordable- I got 2 beers from Florida that I have yet to find anywhere else, each for $4.50. They are mostly bottled or canned, but it really fits in with the laid back atmosphere.\n\nNow onto the good stuff: the food. We started with fried pigs tails, which came coated in a sticky, spicy sauce and topped with sesame seeds. They were piping hot, and extremely meaty (I've had pigs tails in the past that were really fatty). It reminded me of really juicy, wonderful bacon. \n\nMy boyfriend got the miso ramen, with came with a disk of pulled pork that you broke up and mixed into the soup as well as with a soft boiled egg. The egg, when broken, turned the broth into this creamy blend that went great with the tofu. And I'm not a tofu fan. I could have drank that broth all day.\n\nBut the best dish of the night was the hand torn noodles, pulled right in front of us and served with lamb neck and pickled greens. It had the gamey taste from the lamb with a nice bite of salt that was PERFECT with the greens. Sweet, tangy, rich, my word it was so good. And the chunks of lamb were so meaty and tender. I would tell anyone to try this dish, and I most certainly am getting it again.\n\nThis is unlike anything I've had in Philadelphia yet, especially right in the heart of Center City. Get there now!"

        "text": "I absolutely love noodles. \n\nSo I just had to come here once I heard about Cheu's existence. Reading the reviews and descriptions beforehand, I knew the noodles and food aren't authentic in origin but rather the creations of an excellent chef's culinary imagination. That chef happens to have cooked at one of the best restaurants (Matyson) in the city. Despite my general apprehension of Asian fusion cuisine, I ventured into Cheu's Noodle Bar fearlessly..fueled by my obsession of noodles. \n\nThe inside is really small. Exactly how a noodle bar should be like. There's about 3-4 tables besides the stools. Overall, clean and modern look and yet had a very nice cultural and down to earth feel about it. Great first impression as you walk into the place.\n\nWe ordered the following appetizers:\n\n*Black Garlic Wings w/ shishito peppers (4) $ 8: Great tasting garlic flavors on the outside. Had a nice crunch. Although lacked flavors inside. \n\n*Burger & Pork Belly Buns $7: The buns are fried briefly on the outside. The pork belly was absolutely delicious. It was tender and flavorful. Really melted in your mouth. Exactly how it should be. The bun itself wasn't anything special. \n\n*Eggplant w/ crispy garlic, herbs, tamarind  $7: I'm not a huge eggplant fan so I can't really comment. Maybe you are and will love this dish!\n\nWe ordered the following noodles:\n\nPORK BELLY RAMEN W/ POUCHED EGG, SEA BEANS, GREENS $12: \n\nTHE GOOD: Once again, the pork belly was really good. Definitely the standout of the entire experience. \n\nTHE BAD: The broth wasn't horrible. If you never have authentic ramen before, you might actually think it's delicious. My taste buds are spoiled from the likes of Ippudo and Totto. The broth lacked a certain richness and depth. \n\nTHE UGLY: The ramen was chewier and harder than I liked. Not used to eating ramen with this type of noodles. \n\nDUCK PHO w/ FOIE GRAS MEATBALLS $13: I don't really understand why this is called Pho because nothing about it taste like Pho. Instead of the traditional rice noodles, Cheu decided to use the exact ramen noodles for the duck \"pho\" as well...speechless. Aficionados of Pho will be offended. The meatballs were tasty. If you are a fan of pho...be warned! \n\nPrices are on the heavier side. Service was friendly and accommodating. \n\nUltimately- Come here with an open heart about how the food here is conceptionized and prepared and you'll love it more. Read this: Nothing about Cheu is traditional. I genuinely attempted my best to like the noodle bar but years of eating authentic ramen and pho ruined this experience for me.\n\nI wholeheartedly laud owners Ben and Shawn for coming up with this uber cool idea and having the courage to make it a reality. Wish them nothing but success! Will definitely come back one day to see how the food has evolved!"

The kimchi, Matzo ball, with the brisket were delicious. They brisket had a great flavor.  I had the sense that another flavor would have put the meal over the top to awesome. Maybe an herb or another spice? The salt factor was a tad high for my liking. The meal was good enough to go again to try another option. Next time I will get take-out because honestly I can't forgive the wait time."

Within a few hours of ordering, the daily dumpling dish had changed. However, the noodles were pretty standard. I had the duck pho which wasn't anything fantastic. Honestly, I would stick to the appetizers here."

The noodle dish I got was the spicy crab.  I didn't taste much crab and it wasn't all that spicy, but the noodles themselves were good.  I wish I could give 2.5 stars.

These weren't really what I expected, they were balls of rice in a kind of sauce. They were a little bland for my taste, which was weird considering the menu said they were spicy. They weren't bad, but I wouldn't choose to order them again. For my entree, I got the Miso Ramen, which my server said is the most popular dish. I was a little bit disappointed by this.

The bar seats ~20, one 4-top and three 2-tops that can be moved around for up to 6, and we needed a 4-top. \n\nWings were great, bulgogi dumplings were ok. \n\nWe order four noodle bowls. Each was a unique take on the respective dish:\n- brisket ramen was smokey, the brisket would have stood on its own\n- Dan Dan was delicious, the pickled cucumbers added a great sweetness and crunch\n- coconut curry was as flavorful as anything I've had at a Thai restaurant. We subbed fried chicken for tofu. \n- Sichuan shrimp was a great take on a Chinese classic. \n\nIt was a great meal, worth the wait.

We arrived at around 8pm on a Wednesday night and ended up having a nearly hour long wait, despite being told it would be 15-20 minutes. It was fine, since the staff was really nice about it and it really wasn't their fault that people were hanging out for so long after their checks had arrived. \n\nOn to the food. We ordered the black garlic wings, which we practically inhaled. They were absolutely delicious, not too saucy and the perfect portion for the price. I ordered the brisket ramen, and which is where my slight disappointment comes in. The broth was lacking the flavor and spice I was expecting. Being marked as a spicy item on the menu, I expected there to be some heat, but there was almost none. The matzoh ball was surprisingly salty, but in a good way. Overall, it was still a good bowl of ramen, but it really wasn't as flavorful as I was expecting. I'd be curious to try some of their other bowls."

On a Thursday at 6pm the place was already nearly full but we managed to snag the last two bar seats in the house. This place is teeny tiny, it can't seat more than 25 people I'd guess, so plan accordingly to either wait or get there early. It does get pretty loud when it's full.\n\nTo drink I went with the mo-CHEU-to, a house twist on a mojito with jalapeno, and she got a spiked juice. They have a daily rotating selection of a fresh house juice blend, as well as a house iced tea. I love it when bars also cater to people who don't drink alcohol! The juice of the day was a pineapple/chai/vanilla blend, which didn't sound super appealing to me but was actually delicious. My drink had a lot of kick- where so often a drink that features jalapeno is timid and disappointing, this was bold, assertive, and very refreshing. I loved it.\n\nWe shared the popular black garlic chicken wings, which were very good - crispy, substantially meaty, and had a nice glaze. While I was tempted by the crab gazpacho ramen for my entree, I had eaten gazpacho at home every day that week so I went with the item that first caught my eye, the yakisoba. They had just changed up the ingredients so this one had lamb sausage, harissa, pickled mushrooms, and raita. It was like Turkish-Japanese fusion and I loved it. There were some nice crisp-tender pea shoots in there for texture and a pop of green and the flavour combination really worked well together.\n\nMy partner in crime was also interested in straying from her usual brisket ramen and trying the yakisoba, but she's not crazy about lamb. They happily substituted the brisket for the lamb and she seemed to enjoy it very much.\n\nService was very friendly and personable and we had a great time! I don't have a single complaint - will definitely be back soon with my main squeeze. Total before tip was a very reasonable $56 for both of us and it was plenty of food. The cocktails aren't cheap, around $9, so you can get away even cheaper if you don't drink (but if you like a good cocktail it is worth the splurge!)."

Also tried some Pork belly sliders and I thought they were pretty nasty and way overpriced. Not only was it super greasy, but the meat seemed low quality and it was literally 2 bites for $3\n\nThe place is very small and cramped. Most of the seating is at the bar (hence the noodle bar) but it was a very uncomfortable bar area. Not only did I have a thousand people rubbing by my back as they were walking by, my knees were slammed into the bar and I had to lean over to eat. The bar counter just not come out far enough. \n\nAlso, the food preparation was very slow and service was really non existent because you pour your own water.

There are a few tables and some bar seating, but Cheu Noodle Bar seats 25 people tops.\n\nIt is a cool room inside and has a younger feel.  Cheu Noodle Bar would fit into the modern Asian design style. There is a blackboard with drink and food specials and the servers were all pleasant and checked up on us frequently. Cheu Noodle Bar has a decent beer selection and also some interesting looking cocktails. My daughter and I on this night decided to just go with water. It is nice that they leave a big pitcher on the table.\n\nWe started with the Corn Rangoon and this small plate was fantastic. The flavors and textures were excellent and although deep-fried, it still tasted light. There are 4 fried dumplings for $6.00. I ordered the Coconut Curry Noodles that came with chickpeas, torn herbs, and peanut sambal. This noodle bowl was packed with flavors; so much my nose was running early and often. It was relaly good. My dining companion ordered the Miso Ramen with pork shoulder. This was also very good and to us seemed more traditional. The flavors were diverse also but not as powerful as the Coconut Curry.\n\nAll of the above food ran us about $35.00 and we were both stuffed, so much we went for a nice evening stroll to walk it off.\n\n4 stars for Cheu Noodle Bar and as long as I can get in without a long wait I'll return!"

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't tremendously great either. For all of the hype, and going in with a very hungry stomach, I thought I'd be very satisfied with the meal. It wasn't amazing, it wasn't terrible, so it's pretty so-so. Solid average if you ask me.\n\nI tried 2 different types of ramen noodles and had the fried chicken. The ramen had a little red pepper next to it but it came out anything but spicy. And the fried chicken came out a bit too salty with a bit too much soy sauce.\n\nMaybe it's the asian in me, but I've yet to have a bowl of ramen made well done by white people. But I mean, the customer base at this restaurant was mostly (if not entirely) catered to non-Asians. So, I don't blame them for toning the spicy levels down or putting in more salt to match consumer's expectations.\n\nFor ramen in Philly, I still prefer Hiro, which is Japanese owned/run and is only a block or two away and for fried chicken, Cafe Soho (Korean owned/run), on Cheltenham/5th.\n\nService was decent.\n\nOverall: Solid 3/5 but with so many players in town, I'd be hard pressed to try this place out again.\n\nParking: Limited metered street\nPrice: $11+ per person\nWait: 45+ to be seated then another 15-25 mins for the food to arrive after ordering"

Limited seating with the majority at the bar which is literally \"in the kitchen\".\n\nIt was 75 deg outside and what felt like 95 inside.  In addition to my group complaining, we even heard the waitress commenting on how hot it was inside...this is not a place to go when it's hot out!\n\nDumplings: 3 meatball sized pork dumpling in a mild chili sauce.  Meat seamed on the mild side for flavor, but the wrapper was well cooked and they were stuffed full of meat.  The sauce they sat in was a 1 on a scale of 1-10...if the menu didn't list it as a chili sauce, I wouldn't have known..\n\nBlack garlic Wings are average sized chicken wings drenched in a dark and sticky sauce.  The wings were cooked well done without being dried out.  The exterior wasn't crunchy, but not soggy...so I have to say they had good technique, but the sauce is a little flat, tasting like a generic canned Hoison sauce, and then covered in sesame seeds.  I'm not sure where the black garlic came in as I tasted none.  A good, just not spectacular or memorable.\n\nCrispy rice cakes: tatertot sized and tossed in a mild dark sauce with sesame seeds and sauteed myshrooms and cubes of pork...the dish fell flat for me lacking any complex flavors or heat. I'd bet this was the same sauce as the wings, only both sauces were so bland there was nothing distinct enough to help identify them.  We each at two of them and left the bowl.  This really isn't a dish even worth trying again\n\nRamen with pork:  Served in a miso broth with broccoli spears, a soft egg and noodles.  The pork itself was cut slices off of a roast with the fat just before the rendered point.  This may sound appetizing, but what you get is a ton of gelatenous fat and a little uncooked eggwhite floating around and the texture in your mouth is enough to make you want to gag.  I picked out the actual meat pieces of the pork and it has a good flavor, I was not a fan of the miso broth, but if you're a fan of miso soup you'll like it.  The veggies were cooked perfectly as were the noodles, I just wish there were more of them in the dish.  If the pork had been seared a little in a pan before placing in the bowl, it might have been a totally different experience, but watching the chef and seeing how he handled each dish, I have no reason to believe this isn't exactly how he wanted the dish served.\n\nRamen with briskit: same experience as the Ramen with pork, just with pieces of Brisket instead...at least the briskit was cooked and edible.\n\nThe service was good, food came out fast and everyone was friendly.  I have a hard time giving it 2 stars for the food, it was edible, but none of the dishes were anything I wanted to finish, and I grabbed food somewhere else after we left.  So, why the 3 stars?  Well, the overall experience is pleasant and fun and this is really a great place to take a new date.  It's fun and hip with good music and the menu is very adventerous (I'm sure you date has never seen Pig Ears on the menu before!).   You could ask that your bowl come with extra greens/noodles (minus the egg) and some leaner cuts of meat, but you shouldn't have to.  If you're an easy going couple, come here and have fun and enjoy the whole experience, just plan on getting appetizers before at another place...oh, and bring your own watergun and mister if it's not a winter month!"

When seated, you can  feel the floorboards move as people walk by. My friend and I sat at the high-top table in the back, which had stools with spinning seats. There was an awkward adjustment period of learning how to cross and uncross my legs without comically turning around on my seat, but that was more due to my clumsiness than anything else. \n\nLike the restaurant itself, the menu is on the small side too, but it still manages to have a handful of options that can be made veg friendly. I was very, very happy to have so many options. Few ramen bars have one, let alone THREE vegetarian/vegan main course offerings. Cheu scored big points with me there. The coconut curry I ordered was delicious. I thought a very generous helping of hot sauce helped bring out the already-stellar flavors, but that may just be personal preference. The noodles were really a standout. The texture was unique and excellent- bouncy and springy with juuuuust the right amount of chewiness.

The broth, which to me is the heart of good noodle soup is yummy and very satisfying, not overly salty. I had the oxtail special with an extra helping of greens, and a side order of dumplings in chili oil. There were several other items I would have liked to try but will save them for the next trip. Kindof a younger hip crowd but the vibe is nice and warm ramen takes the edge off of the cold."

I have never had a bad meal, but my favorites are their Miso Ramen, Brisket ramen, anything with hand torn noodles, and any appetizer. The french fries with truffle mayo and bonito are totally worth the heart problems. I think that they are lunch only. \nIf you can, sit at the chef's bar. That crew is no joke and fun to watch in the kitchen. \nThe service is great and relaxed. If you wind up waiting for a table, they will make sure that you get a cocktail.

The black garlic wings were fabulous - vinegary and tangy and so crispy and tender. Squeeze that lime on top for nice zing. \n\nMain course was a bowl of miso ramen and brisket ramen to slurp and share. The brisket ramen is OUT OF THIS WORLD good. The brisket was so tender and the broth so flavorful. We couldn't get enough!  The miso ramen was also great - the greens are a nice bitter note to the sweeter broth. The pork shoulder was tender and tasty. Both had snappy noodz to slurp. Would have eaten it all but ran out of room in our bellies!\n\nThe service is super friendly.

It's a small place so be wary of the tight quarters and they don't take reservations so make sure you allow extra time if there is a wait (and there almost always is). My favorites include the black garlic wings (voted best wings in Philly last year), brisket ramen, miso ramen, and unfortunatly not on the current menu but the hand torn noodles with lamb and dates was amazing as well as the BBQ pig tails!  Bring these back Cheu!! The price of ramen at this restaurant is maybe slightly more than what you pay for in Chinatown, but the quality of the ingredients and the broth more than make up for the few extra dollars you may spend.  Cheu makes a great spot for lunch or a late night meal as well and they do take-out which is also a plus! Be open minded with the non-traditional and give this place a try...you won't leave disappointed, but if you get the brisket ramen, you definitely will leave full!"

Let me preface this review with saying that I will come back and try this again when it's not a polar vortex Tuesday when apparently that's the busiest day of the year and my group waited from 7:30 until 10pm for seating and for the food to arrive.\n\nIf you are coming to cheu noodle bar for authentic ramen you are making a bad choice. If you are coming for a hipsterized Americanized version of noodle soup with pork or crab or \"curry\" based broth you might be making a good choice. The prices are high considering the comparison for noodle soups out there. Hand drawn noodles in Chinatown or Nom Nom easily outcompete on price to food.\n\nThe miso ramen which is their flagship bowl I suppose is lacking in depth of porkiness and the half cooked egg while it isn't authentic is actually quite a good rendition. The noodles are far from true ramen noodles, but they are good. The biggest shortcut is the pork shoulder. If I'm paying $13 for ramen, it really should have 4 slices of fork tender pork belly and an insane amount of broth. \n\nThankfully, even though I'm a meager 165 lbs, I had also ordered a second bowl. The spicy crab broth had the potential to be amazing. It wasn't particularly \"crabby\" and that could have really been spectacular. The meatballs were simple and tasty though and the hand drawn noodles were actually the best thing I ate that evening. Nevertheless, the broth was just too vinegary and has a lot of room for improvement.\n\nThe biggest issue this place is suffering from is staff and service. They are actually all quite pleasant but there is about 8 people working there and literally only 1 person is assembling the bowls of soup. She was lightning fast but they need to focus more staff on soup and less on running around accomplishing less important tasks of a noodle bar. No one is coming here for the beer selection or tito's vodka, guys. \n\nWhile this review won't hurt Cheu because they have an endless supply of Jefferson students and residents who won't walk an extra 3 blocks to get to Chinatown and save $3. It's just too easy to swagger into this place. It's good, but they need to really focus on their core dishes and expand their noodle bowl seating.\n\nTry spicy noodles at Nom Nom instead and I think you'll be a convert."

This restaurant is small- ~10 bar seats, ~10 dining table seats. The max number of people you should come with is six and you probably have to wait a long time. We were greeted by the waitress/hostess and sat at the bar because that were the only open seats. Their menu fits in one page so there aren't too many options. \nI ordered the Pork Pizza Dumplings, Garlic Wings, and Miso Ramen. They had interesting flavors...\nThe Pork Pizza dumplings (with chili oil) honestly tasted like pizza rolls you get in the freezer department at your local supermarket except rolled into a dumpling. It tasted okay but not great. \nThe Garlic Wings were decent. They had a nice soy glaze but it was a little over-fried. The shishito peppers added a nice flavor to this dish. \nThe Miso Ramen... did not taste anything like a miso ramen... When I tried the soup, I thought I received the wrong order. It definitely had some Asian-y flavors but I couldn't recognize any of it. \n\nThe restaurant has a nice ambiance and they have an okay drink list but other than that, I definitely wouldn't come here for the food.

We were able to be seated right away, but our seats were at the bar. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both have allergies (me to peanuts, him to both peanuts and shrimp), so we're pretty careful when we go out to eat and read the menu thoroughly. After we both ordered the brisket ramen, our server was chatting with us about a customer who had an allergic reaction after eating the brisket ramen because of the shrimp it contains. We were obviously alarmed because nowhere on the menu was it listed that there was shrimp in the brisket ramen. Luckily, we were able to change my boyfriend's order before he ate it. I just thought it was strange because shrimp is such a common allergen, and this has obviously happened numerous times, so you would think that they would attempt to make a change. \n\nThe rest of our meal was pretty good. I liked the fusion aspect of my brisket ramen, and my boyfriend enjoyed his miso ramen. Not sure if Cheu really lives up to the hype, but it was a decent meal nonetheless."

It is a combination of Japanese ramen, Korean kimchi, Jewish Matzo ball and American BBQ brisket. The soup base is a little bit salty to my taste and the brisket was a little dry. I think the chef is targeted for American taste not traditional Japanese ramen flavoring. \nThis is our second trip coming here, but the first time we decided to try sushi after the host informed us of 2-hour waiting time. \nIt is difficult to find a parking spot around, and the lighting was too dim for me.\nTo be honest, the ramen options around Chinatown area are much better and no waiting at all."

It was cold out and I had been walking around most of the morning so I figured this would be perfect. It was pretty perfect. Ahh ramen. Extra noodles? Yes please. Pork belly for only a couple of extra bucks? Yup! The pork belly was vital. A little chili paste, a couple of squirts of fresh lime and I went to town. After I was done, I felt great.

They were cooked nicely, but I would have liked a little more of the pickled garnish.  My dining companion disagrees....\n\nThen came the wings that are carrying a lot of hype on the food blogs.  I had very high expectations, and surprisingly, I was not disappointed.  These are excellent, triple fried, jumbo wings with a deep flavor profile. Sticky, Asian, salty, oniony, garlicy, spicey, soy-ey!\n\nWe shared the hand-drawn noodles with lamb neck, pickled greens, and dates.

I'm raving about corn? Yea. I am. It was awesome. and truffly, and saucy. and crunchy. and just delicious. Must-try.\n\n-Pork belly and cheeseburger buns- toasty delicious bun bread, seasoned cucumbers and sauce perfectly accompanied the juicy pork belly and cheeseburger ball. Highly recommend.\n\n-Broccoli with peanut and Vietnamese sausage- biggest complaint was having to use chopsticks to get every bit of what was left in that bowl. Torture! Perfectly seasoned and cooked crunchy.\n\n-Long Beans-These Szechwan peppercorns are no joke. similar flavor to some Handy Nasty dishes, and just as hot! Great, unique flavor though.\n\nNOODLES\n-Cold Jade Noodle- great flavor, crunch, chewy noodles, awesome combination of flavors and the crowd favorite.\n\n-Hand torn with lamb-huge fat noodles basically in a BBQish sauce. Super tender lamb.\n\n-Cold Sesame Noodles- so fresh and delicious, nothing like Handy nasty's though.\n\n-Ramen- we weren't impressed with this. It was good, but just not anything exciting or amazing. \n\nDessert\n-Finished off with a sesame doughnut which I really enjoyed. Crispy outside, mushy inside, hint of banana?\n\nOverall, would recommend for a casual lunch/dinner with a friend, probably not a first date or with someone you're really trying to impress though.

The hanging lamps were created by one of the owner's glass-blowing brothers. Canned craft beers and other libations will soon be available to knock back with. The hand-torn collage on the back wall adds a touch of funk. They serve up raw Shin Ramyun as a complimentary appetizer (awesome idea).\n\nOne must keep in mind that this is not meant to be an Asian restaurant. Rather, it is two American men identifying aspects of various Asian cuisines and recreating it according to what tastes good to them. Taking this into account, Cheu successfully accomplishes what it set out to accomplish - providing a cool atmosphere for people to enjoy what the owners personally like about Asian food. \n\nBut Asian food it is not. The noodles are a bit too chewy (though props for being made in-house), and the flavor combinations are heavy on the \"sweet and sour\" aspect so characteristic of Asian fusion. The ramen broth is better than some other ramen joints in Philly, but it could stand to be more complex. The pork belly is fatty and delicious, but the flimsy poached egg is a bit of a travesty ramenly-speaking. I preferred the cumin-seasoned lamb neck (served with hand-torn noodles), even if the noodles were a bit too large and stuck together. The black garlic wings were the highlight of the meal. Crispy and juicy, similar to Korean fried chicken, but a little greasier (in a good way).\n\nSo yes, Cheu is a really cool place. And the owners did a great job of creating dishes they liked.

I left quite unsatisfied. \n\nService - weird and subpar to their norm. Looking past the fact the our waitress forgot to put in our order of noodles and kept us waiting for an extra 20-30 minutes. And looking past the fact that given the delay, they talked up this \"discount\" they were giving us (literally spoke about it 3x to us even though it was completely unsolicited) but it turned out to be a generous \"discount\" of $5 on a $50+ bill. I got a poor suggestion for my order. It's the food that matters and when my appetite is left unsatisfied that's a deal breaker for me. \n\nFood - usually their dumplings are awesome. Cheeseburger dumplings: flavor is too overwhelming. We left the last one b/c we weren't fans and they were so shocked they just left the plate on our table the entire meal....finally they cleared it at the end and even then the bus boy asked us again, for the 5th time, if we wanted it. No. We didn't or else it wouldn't still be in the plate. \n\nCoconut Noodles: weird. Not a good weird. When I asked the waitress what she thought she told me it was good but she always adds something to it. Little did I know I NEEDED to add something to it to make it a satisfying meal. It is very spicy. Hotness took over the flavor and I'm more about flavor than burning my tongue. Not in it for the thrill...in it for the taste. It really just tasted like hot sauce with a dab of coconut water. Some basil/mint flavoring but not enough basil/min could save it. Wasn't horrible but certainly wasn't good or even satisfying. The worst is leaving a restaurant hungry. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you wanted to add so much to it, making it a different dish. Which in that case you could just order a different dish. I would stick with the classics. \n\nIn conclusion, stick with the classics and you'll be very happy. If you don't have your noddles but everyone that was seated 20 min after you has their noddles ... ask about it. And when they offer a completely unsolicited discount expect it to be so meager it's almost embarrassing they mentioned it. Other than that I would have given them 4 stars!!!"

        "text": "I met a friend at Cheu for happy hour on Wednesday - the start of Sips season. This bar doesn't participate, which was why I chose it because I am too old for the Sips crowd. Also, I have walked past this place a few times and noted the cool chalkboard signs out front. I think this place originally made its way onto my radar for the happy hour specials including wings and dumplings and $2 High Life's. Note: High Life's are no longer part of the Happy Hour menu. Damb.\n\nWhen I first walked in, I headed to the bar and the host guy kind of stopped me. Not physically stopped me, but he gave me a judgmental eye so fierce it had me hesitating. Apparently the bar isn't so much a \"bar\" as it is a seat-by-the-kitchen, so it's not seat yourself. Like when you sit at the \"bar,\" you're watching the dudes make the food right there in front of you. There's no \"bartender\" to serve you. I can see where this might seem like a good idea, but mehhhh.\n\nAnyway, I was solo and there was like 3 other people in the entire restaurant (only 1 person at the \"bar\") and the host asked me when the rest of my party was going to arrive because they typically don't seat \"incomplete parties.\" What? I can drink while I wait for my one friend to arrive, bruh. Just let me sit in your empty restaurant, k? I don't take up much space.\n\nI sat and waited for my friend to arrive (within the 10-15 minutes I quoted, though, I did notice the host continuously side eye me). The waitress was kind at first - she brought me a beer sample because I don't like to commit to a whole beer before I know if I like it so it doesn't go to waste. No worries about that because the beer I received was in the tiniest beer glass I think is allowed by law or something. If it was a whole pint, I am honestly flabbergasted by the laws of physics allowing an entire pint of beer to fit in that child size root beer hard candy looking mug. When my friend arrived, she ordered the same beer I did. The waitress popped over shortly after we each had a drink to take our food order but we had been chatting and weren't ready yet. At this point, I noticed the waitress start to get annoyed with us. Listen, your restaurant is not full and I intend on eating so don't be mad at me! \n\nSide note, since the \"bar\" isn't a real bar with a bartender and since there is a kitchen behind the bar, the waitress kept popping up behind us.  Little odd. I get it, like she had no choice based on the architecture of the space, but it's weird to constantly be addressed from behind throughout a meal.\n\nWe each ordered from the happy hour menu: dumplings for each of us, I ordered wings, and she ordered ragoons. The food was delicious. The wings were seasoned perfectly (if you like a mild cilantro surprise, like I do) and were crispy. Definitely K[orean]FC vibe. The dumplings were flavorful. I expected to be left a little hungry and was planning to order a second round of food afterward but the two happy hour apps really filled me up. The food was a pleasant surprise given the odd service experience up to that point.\n\nHonestly, I am conflicted. The service/vibe here was weird. But the food seems so promising based on the happy hour experience. Prices are reasonable (and would be moreso with a larger pour of beer). I'd like to come back and try more of the menu or even just get those wings again but the host/waitress kind of turned me off and I don't know if I will be back.  I wanted to really like you, Cheu. I really did."

If I can pick a single non-flaw about this dish it's what I wish I had a dozen or so dates in there instead of the 4 that I got.\n\nIn addition, I had a cheeseburger bun, a pork belly bun, a mung bean bun, and scrapple w/pickles, and dumplings in chili oil, and a pig tail (I was hungry and so were my sharing-happy companions). All of these were completely outstanding. It came out to $20 a head--a bit pricy for the quantity, but when you really get some over-the-top delicious food like this, it's worth spending more than you would for a step down (sorry, Nan Zhou! Yeah, I went there)."

I had walked quite a bit before, so their special drink watermelon juice was very refreshing, though I thought it was a bit too pricey ($5 or something).  I would have loved to try one of their cocktails, but I had to drive.  For the noodle, I wanted to get soft-shell crab, but they said they're out of the crab so it'll be shrimp balls instead, so I went for it.  It was delicious!  I could tell that they made shrimp balls fresh, and I liked the fresh cilantro in them.  If I'm back in Philly and crave for some creative, good Asian noodles, I'd definitely be back.

Instead, you'll get homemade ramen; foie gras meatballs that have the perfect balance of the richness of foie gras and the texture of a meatball; slices of duck flank steak that are softer than filet mignon and look nothing like duck; and amazing flavors that are packed in every bite.\n\nI find the techniques and skills that go into making an Asian dish foreign to Asians extremely remarkable. Every dish we ordered was a pleasant surprise. There was so little Korean in my favorite Korean dishes - fried chicken, rice cake and kimchi - that this might be the only restaurant where I can find my new favorite \"Korean dishes.\" \n\nI believe it was intentional that chef Ben did not do a perfect replica. With that, please don't judge the restaurant based on \"authenticity.\" I haven't seen a poached egg perfected until I've eaten here (no clear eggwhite, the yolk is between liquid and solid so that when you take a bite of the yolk, it doesn't run but remain in shape). It was not meant to be a seasoned hanjuku tamago.\n\nAs far as cost goes, the quality of ingredient and taste is much better than Chifa and Morimoto at a more affordable price."

Finding this place was a total accident, but it was crowded so it had to be good. We put our name down and 45 minutes later got the call that our table was ready. I really appreciate places that take your number. It's so much nicer to be able to walk around rather than stand in front of the place and wait. \n\nFirst off, we didn't get a table but rather got the counter. Usually I don't like to eat at counters but facing into the kitchen is pretty cool. I really like to see what being put into my food. It was also pretty fascinating to see how both chefs worked together but separately. One chef makes the soup bowls while another makes the noodle bowls. So if your party order both soups and noodles, they will come out at different times. I don't mind it at all, and actually prefer that I get my food as soon as it's done. \n\nI got the brisket ramen. Oh. My. God. It was so good. As someone who doesn't necessarily like fusion cuisine, I was so impressed and didn't feel confused eating it. The brisket was so tender and obviously smoked perfectly- with the beautiful pink ring on the outside. The matzo was typical, but served as a great textural element with the broth. The kimchi was as good as I've had at any Korean restaurant. But the menu indicated this was going to be spicy. While it had a bit of heat, it didn't make me sweat- which I guess is good for the summer. They have chili oil and sriracha on the counter. I thought about using it, but I didn't want to mess up the flavor profile or being stuck blowing my nose during the meal. \n\nThe staff was really friendly. Every waitress came up and talked to us- both checking on how we were doing and telling me I looked like Sansa Stark from Game of Thrones. They also have a really good playlist, but it was a little loud. There was a lot of people talking in a very small space. But I come to restaurants for the food, not necessarily to have a salon. I could be heard without yelling and the food was phenomenal. That's all I look for."

There are slight things here and there that are off (or maybe I am just a purist), and after I finished my dishes I was either left wondering if I liked their twists (i.e. the matzo ball) or wishing I had the traditional instead (marinated egg vs. the soft poached egg they give you).\n\nThat said, their apps are a completely different story. The dumpling we got were the creamy corn and bacon, which tasted like corn chowder in a dumpling. That's not a great description, but if you are a corn chowder fan, you will love these dumplings! Surprisingly sweet and creamy, with just a hint of salty ummami from the bacon. They also had a BBQ pig tail dish, which looks almost like ribs. For some reason, I was expect curly octopus like tentacles on my place. The dish itself was very fatty, but the sauce was out of this world.\n\nIn my opinion, the music was just awful, hipster music and the volume changed from being barely tolerable to an intolerable volume.

Our go-to items here are the dumplings (fillings change on a daily basis but you can't go wrong), miso ramen, and the matzo ball brisket ramen. I've had my fair share of dumplings, but these have to be my absolute favorite. So flavorful, and topped with a bit of crunch, adding an amazing texture. The miso ramen is my personal favorite. The broth is heavy, but I've never tasted a soup with more flavor. I thought they may have added cream to the broth, but found out it's really just from all the fat- but no complaints there! The matzoball brisket is also a crowd favorite. I mean, just the description is so unique you have to try it. The broth is a little spicy, so not my forte, but I've never seen an empty bowl.\n\nAnd the staff are great too.

Some of the flavors are what I would call \"stoner food.\" That is not an insult - far from it!"

We were seated quickly at the bar at around 7:30 pm on a Saturday... the place is small so if we'd been only a few minutes later we would have had to wait.\n\nI was disappointed to find that only three of the entrees could be made gluten free, and one of the apps. I definitely didn't want the sausage and broccoli app, so the waitress suggested we try the shishito peppers (gluten free if you're not sensitive to them being flash-fried in the same oil). We did and they were good -- came in a yummy sauce. For entrees, I wanted the shrimp dan dan noodles with rice noodles subbed in, and was confused when the waitress said they don't do that. She said they use rice instead of noodles but insisted it was really good. I went for it, and immediately regretted it. It came out totally flavorless -- so much rice, and not much of anything else. I was kicking myself for not trying the coconut curry noodles instead. My boyfriend enjoyed his spicy flat noodles, though they were extremely spicy.\n\nOverall, I can see why someone without any dietary restrictions would enjoy Cheu, but there aren't enough legit gluten free options for me to ever return."

I suggest making reservations as the place is super small but there is also quick turnover. The wings are to die for, the meat just melts off the bone. I also highly suggest adding a matzo ball to any bowl that you get!"

I had the Shochu punch which was well balanced and delicious. Hubs had a tie one on. He loved it. On to the food. The corn rangoons are crispy, creamy corn filled goodness. I loved the crunch followed by the sweet corn filling.  Hubs got the black garlic wings which were big and meaty with amazing flavor. The Shishito peppers are what Food love is made of. Seriously not only were they charred  to perfection but the sauce and cheese made them pop. I actually took a to go order back to the hotel for a late night snack.  For our main we had Sichuan spicy fat noodle. The noodles were chewy and amazing with the perfect amount of spice.  The portions are generous.  Really just a great overall experience."

I tried a whole bunch of appetizers and had two types of ramen while here. Ramen didn't have enough broth in the bowl. The wait was atrocious, and we asked for a table and waited close to 30 minutes and got a bar seat instead, which is not what we wanted. The employees are pretty young, and if I were to describe this place it would be hipster asian fusion noodle bar. Not Chew Noodle bar, which almost mistakens it for an authentic ramen place."

Going for the complete opposite of most Asian fusion places' clean, modern route, this small place has bright red walls, quirky decorations, and an alternative rock soundtrack. The menu is very small with about five appetizers, a couple choices of dumplings, and some larger dishes. \n\nMy friend and I didn't come as hungry as we would have liked to be, so we got dumplings and hand torn noodles to share. The dumplings are so satisfying with a great textural element sprinkled on top. I wish the chili sauce was a little spicier true to Asian flavors. The hand torn noodles were perrrrrfectly cooked, which is hard to come by in a lot of Asian cuisine. (I think of overdone noodles slightly congealed and stuck together.) The sauce is very savory and rich with chunks of lamb and tangy bites of pickled greens to cut the richness. I would order this a thousand times again. \n\nThe beer list was pretty great and it's awesome that they have a daily beer special. Gotta come back to try the pork belly buns and, when it's cooler, the ramen."

The pork shoulder was so tender and the broth was flavorful and delicious.  My boyfriend got the yakisoba noodles and since we're carnivores, he added pork belly.

        "text": "I had the Ramen, their dumplings of the day (smoked pork + mushrooms), and their bun of the day (tempura pig ears with kimchi). While their Ramen was alright, their appetizers were GREAT!\n\nJust so you know, they told me their noodles were made in house which I think is a great factor they should stress more about... house made noodles rather than mass produced store noodles definitely makes it better! It was also nice that they give you a little snack before your meal; for my friends and I we got a small saucer of honey lime chili popcorn. It was a little stale (and we ate it when the restaurant opened for the day...so I suspect this was not freshly made for the day), but the flavor was great. But onto the food:\n\nRAMEN ($12):\n- Noodles itself were good and had the thick semi springy texture of fresh noodles that I like; I wish there was a little more of it though. If I didn't have appetizers with it, I don't think I would have been that full with just this Ramen bowl itself.\n- Broth was average... wasn't terrible but it was a bit on the bland side, I had to add some sriracha to give it a little kick. \n- Cha siu they used was more like Chinese style red pieces of cha siu which was not too bad since the meat was tender. But I wish they used Japanese style cha siu for ramen?? There was no fatty meat in the pork at all. \n- There was also a poached egg and some veggies in the ramen. It would be nice if they could someday make ajitsuke eggs though for their ramen! That'd really be a delicious plus.\n\nDUMPLINGS ($3):\nThey're made in house! There was three in the bowl, it is small-ish like dimsum sized, and come in chili oil. The skin had a nice semi chewy texture to it, and the filling of smoked pork and mushroom WAS AMAZING I loved it so much. I wish there was more because it was so good and delightfully flavorful. \n\nBUN ($2 EACH)\nI had the pig ear with kimchi special of the day just because it sounded interesting... Their buns come a bit smaller than typical Asian buns but I forgave it for the interesting flavor combos they had. They make their bun bread a tiny bit different, as in they pan fry it or something to give it a crunchy texture? I like the way they make their bun though, and the insides of tempura pig eared with kimchi was quite delish! Delightfull crunchy with good flavor mix. My friends got the normal pork belly bun, and I think the only criticism they had about it was that the fat-to-meat proportion of the pork belly was too high! Almost 3/5 fat and 2/5 meat.\n\nI would have knocked this restaurant to 3 stars, if it wasn't for the redeeming facts that they make their noodles in-house and their unique and very delicious appetizers! I think Cheu Noodle Bar really has potential if they fixed their broth to be more flavorful, as ramen should be the star of the restaurant seeing that they're a noodle bar."

Why restaurnters still don't get that one dines out for the enjoyment of the food and the company of others, and that is almost impossible when music is blaring and bouncing off the walls, made worse in this case by the intimate size of the room. And to be told that the volume could not be turned down because the manager- who was absent- wanted it that way, as did the customers. Anyone ever survey the room? Patrons have to yell to be heard across the miniscule tables. So, no matter how good the food, I never return a third time: I always give a second chance! I am accused of being an old fogey, but I can't believe ANYONE, at ANY age, enjoys having to speak loudly during a dining experience. I am done."

        "text": "Tl;dr a trendy, Westernized ramen bar with solid food and overpriced drinks\n\nCheu Noodle Bar turns the traditional ramen bar on its head, opting for offbeat decor, Japanese fusion dishes, and an emphasis on booze to complement your meal. The cramped space has a handful of tables toward the entrance, while the bar and open-kitchen concept stretch all the way back. Opposite the bar, the wall is decorated with graffiti art and squares of uncooked ramen noodles. Bright red walls and colored Christmas lights play up the \"dive bar\" ambiance. Be warned how popular this Wash West joint gets during prime time -- they do not take reservations during weekend nights. But with every day happy hour, including $5 small bites and drink specials, even off-hours have their perks. Vegetarian, vegan or gluten-free? No problem -- a millennial spot like Cheu has you covered for these dietary restrictions.\n\nI rolled through Cheu happy hour the other day with a friend, and we were seated immediately. While it was but moderately full when we grabbed our table, the space reliably began to fill up as afternoon turned to evening. Service was prompt and friendly, perhaps on the casual side.\n\nI opted for the Miso Ramen, while he ordered the Sichuan Spicy Fat Noodles, and we both tried the mixed drink of the day, Spicy Whiskey. Our drinks were brought out within a few minutes, followed quickly by the food. My ramen was perfect for a rainy day -- the rich meaty-and-garlicky broth set the stage for the well-cooked noodles and the melt-in-your-mouth pork shoulder. I found myself slurping every last drop of broth, which I almost never do with soups. My only concern was with the arugula on the ramen, which I found blasphemously hipster-y, even for Cheu. While the food was remarkable, the drinks fell flat -- there were small, not particularly strong, and served in ice that further diluted the flavor. For $7 (which is the happy hour price, too!), I expected better. Next time I'll definitely aim for a draft over the cocktails.\n\nFor $25 each, my buddy and I left satisfied with our tasty soups, albeit a tad hungry. Cheu is definitely a place to try at least once, for the experience if nothing else."

A group came in while we were there and it was really difficult for the employees to accommodate them. \nBut anyway, THE RAMEN! I got the brisket ramen with the matzoh ball. I was interested in traditional ramen but I was too curious about this. It was fabulous. I loved it so much. The brisket was so tasty. The noodles were fresh. I really really enjoyed it. I've only had one other ramen that tops that and it's not in Philadelphia so it doesn't count. My boyfriend got the miso ramen and he loved it. I had a taste of it and i thought it was wonderful. \nThey have cocktails too. I didn't have one because it was a bit too early for me, but they have happy hour even on the weekend that id love to try. \nAnyway, I really didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. I thought the matzoh ball thing would be gimmicky but wow- it works... \nalso they had really great music. They played my favorite song \"they reminisce over you\" by Pete rock and cl smooth.

This one drew us because of the fusion aspect, and it was definitely worth giving it a try. It's a delicious different take. \n\nWe started with the falafel rangoons, which were filled with a falafel and goat cheese mixture and fried to a golden perfection. I could probably eat 50 of those and be perfectly happy, but sadly we only got one order. \n\nI then got the brisket matzo ball ramen. The matzo ball was good, but not as good as my mom's haha. The brisket was tender and delicious, and worked surprisingly well with the kimchi in the bowl. The broth was complex and warm and very comforting on a chilly evening. Overall an unusual yet delicious bowl of ramen, though I will point out that they are a bit more expensive than the traditional ramen places nearby in Chinatown.\n\nSidenote, be warned that the place is TINY, as in it seats maybe 15 people, try not to go during peak business hours if you don't want to wait."

Cheu is a prime example of why I think the Philly food scene can hold its own. \n\nCheu is not the average noodle shop. They would be the first to say that they don't make \"authentic\" noodles (though they are fully capable of making a good bowl of ramen: see miso ramen). Instead, they eschew traditional ramen flavors in favor of what is, simply put, good eating. We started with the beef dumplings which were done perfectly right with the touch of crunchy quinoa giving a surprising touch. The chicken wings were subtle yet complex in their flavor. The pigtails were a revelation, the salty, fatty crunch balanced by the well spiced and perfectly sour pickled tomatoes. \n\nI had the brisket noodle which was what I would imagine a Jewish-Korean-Japanese family would eat on a rainy day. As strange as that may sound, it works wonderfully here. And might I commend their soft boiled egg too. If the mark of a cook is how well they can execute an egg, do these Philly boys deliver! Velvety, rich, it proved how egg can be luxurious and move seductively in a bowl. I also tried the spicy crab broth which harkened to soup flavors I've had in Filipino/Malaysian/Vietnamese cuisines. \n\nThis is the kind of place that would thrive in SF and were it over there, I'd eat here all the time. To those from SF, think Mission Chinese does noodles. I'd even go as far as saying that it's better than most Asian places doing noodles. As I kept saying throughout my meal, what a phenomenal little surprise."

The restaurant does do takeout, but I recommend eating in if you can manage to get a seat at the bar or one of the few tables.\n\nFood:\nTuna bombs ($11)- This dish was pretty good. It's basically a ball of raw tuna stuffed with avocado with a really nice green chilly sauce on top. While an enjoyable dish, I didn't think it was anything particularly special. I've had much more standout tuna dishes at sushi restaurants.\nBlack garlic wings ($10)- The wings are definitely worth trying! The sauce had a unique Asian flair, and the wings were perfectly crispy.\nCorn rangoon ($6)- We got this dish to go, but the wontons don't really travel well and get a little soggy within a couple hours. The flavor was pretty mild, and while I enjoyed it, I don't need to order the dish again. \nPan fried gyoza ($7)- The sauce served with the gyoza was flavorful, and the pickled ginger added a nice zest. The flavor was still pretty mild overall, and I think any unadventurous or picky eater would enjoy it.\nYakisoba ($13)- This dish was probably my favorite of everything! The noodles were perfectly prepared, and the lamb was nice and crispy. The flavors and textures complimented each other perfectly. \n\nDrinks:\nRiot punch ($11)- This tastes exactly like a typical fruit punch. It's sweet, and you can't taste the alcohol. While enjoyable, I didn't think it was anything special.\nSpiked juice ($10)- This was our favorite drink! It tasted sooooo fresh. They make it with whatever fresh fruit they receive in bulk that week. When we had it, the flavor was a blend of watermelon, jalape\u00f1o, and Thai basil. The watermelon was the only flavor that really came through, but it was a great refreshing taste!\nMargarita- This didn't taste like any margarita I've ever had. I love margaritas, but I didn't particularly enjoy this one. It tasted too sweet and fruity for a margarita. I prefer a little sourness.\nSpiked bourbon ($11)- This drink was very good, but I'm not a big bourbon fan. It had a nice smokey flavor to it, and I think whiskey lovers will really enjoy this.\n\nWe sat at the bar, and the bartender/server was great about checking in and asking if we needed anything else. The food and drinks came out really quickly after ordering. My only criticism is that the servers don't know what foods meet certain dietary restrictions. We asked if the brisket ramen and yakisoba had any pork in them, and our server told us that they both did. We substituted the lamb sausage in the yakisoba for tofu, but when one of the cooks came out to give us the yakisoba, we found out that the lamb sausage doesn't have any pork. We had to get the lamb sausage on the side rather than mixed in with the dish. The cook also informed us that the brisket ramen could have come without pork. I wish all the staff was on the same page, because I really wanted to try the brisket ramen. That's the biggest reason for the loss of a star in this review. \n\nAlso, the menu changes every couple of months or so, so be sure to check online for the menu that they're currently serving. Don't just rely on Yelp reviews! For instance, they don't serve the coconut curry anymore."

From the pictures posted to Instagram alone, I could tell that their chef/owners constantly change up their menu, and everything looked so darn tasty.\n\nI finally had an opportunity to check it out this past week, and I'm happy that my friend and I decided to check it out on a weekday (Wednesday night) because the space is quite cosy and the bar not quite big enough had we wanted to grab a drink as we waited (about 10 mins).\n\nIt was totally worth the snowy trek across town - we sat at the bar and ordered a couple beers as we looked over the menu. Sitting there, we had an opportunity to really soak in the hipster-ness of the place. I wouldn't describe myself as hipster, but I remember thinking that I was glad that I had taken a little time to pick out what I was going to wear that night. It was by no means dressy, but it's definitely not a place I'd wear sweats to.\n\nAnywho, when I go to a restaurant for the first time, I generally go big, so my friend and I ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. To start we had the broccoli, black garlic wings, and a pork belly bun. And for our entrees we shared the yakisoba and brisket ramen. I was nervous that it might be too much food, but we had no problem finishing everything. The wings came out first, and boy were they meaty. Honestly neither of us had ever had black garlic so weren't sure how garlicky the wings would be (and I love garlic), so honestly it was my own fault that the wings weren't quite garlicky enough for me. That being said, the cilantro, sesame seeds, and sweet and savory sticky sauce was delicious and the wings super meaty. I'm glad we tried the pork belly bun, but honestly since we split it I can't really give a fair assessment of it. I think I may have to go back and eat an entire one for myself before I pass judgment. Preliminarily, however, it was as good of a pork belly bun as I've ever had. We both LOVED the broccoli appetizer. To be fair, I LOVE broccoli in pretty much any circumstance, but I thought it was cooked perfectly, and the fresh peanuts and sauce were a great compliment to broccoli's natural nuttiness. I will definitely be going back for more. \n\nNow, the entrees were tasty and filling and perfect for the frigid cold night that we went, but I can't say that I was blown away. The yakisoba was stick-to-your-bones good, especially with the creamy egg on top, but I didn't think it was seasoned as well as it could have been. The tofu was cooked perfectly, and the noodles not overdone, but it felt like some flavor was missing. The brisket ramen was flavorful and comforting, but I was a bit disappointed by how fatty the meat was. That being said, we slurped up every last drop of the broth.\n\nNext time I head to Cheu Noodle Bar - and there will definitely be a next time - I want to try their miso ramen and other entrees. I'm seriously loving their Instagram postings, so I'll definitely be keeping tabs on what specials they have and try to head over when I see something that looks especially tasty."

I've officially visited every ramen restaurant in Philadelphia now. The miso ramen had a good base but the pork shoulder tasted like Chipotle's carnitas. It was a strange combination that didn't settle well after an hour. The fresh flat Szechuan noodles is a classic Chinese dish served in many Szechuan restaurants. The one here was drowning in chili oil but didn't have the depth of flavor. The noodles were fresh so they had great flavor absorption potential, but the potential was wasted because they sucked up oil. I finished maybe 1/3 of the dish. Prices were higher than other similar restaurants."

For 5 dollars, you can get green beans, garlic chicken wings, or (my personal favorite), samosa rangoons. Be warned though - there is very limited seating, and it is best to go during \"off hours\", otherwise you might be awkwardly waiting along the back for a while."

We started with the buns appetizer, which I thought being it's a Asian Fusion cuisine would be more like Dim Sum, but the buns are comparable to sliders. We had the pork belly and the mushroom buns.  The flavor was excellent and they clearly could be addictive if you order more than a few.  We also had the noodles, Coconut Curry and Lamb Neck.  Both were excellent.  Great flavor and presentation and nicely spicy but you can add some heat with the chili oil or sriracha condiments on the table.  The service was very attentive and the kitchen is immaculate.  This place is really great and a nice addition to the middle village neighborhood."

The meatball were tasty and the ramen soup is definitely something I will order again. The  service was just Exceptional. The waitress was on top of her game.

I started off with the sweet and sour Brussels sprouts, which was a pretty interesting dish. It was more sour than I was expecting than sweet, but was alright.\n\nThe Brisket Ramen was a very interesting fusion dish though that I was a fan of. Combining brisket and a matzo ball with kimchi in a chili broth, this is a very creative adaptation of Japanese-Ashkenazi Jewish-Korean cuisines. The brisket was tender, and the chili broth had a very deep taste profile to it."

I liked that the noodles weren't mushy like at some places, but overall I definitely think what I got was completely overpriced. Correct me if I'm wrong but ramen is all about broth right? It wasn't very flavorful just really salty. Not sure if I feel like spending $17 to try another dish here... I'm sure there are much better, more affordable places in the city."

        "text": "I was pretty excited when I heard that Cheu Noodle had opened up down the block from my apartment. My coworker and I wandered inside one afternoon to try it out. It was crazy small inside and we were seated by the window at a very small table. \n\nOur server was polite and explained the menu to us and she brought out a plate of broken up Shin Ramen with the spice on top. I guess it's kind of cute that they use that as a \"snack\" but I think it's a bit lame too... Anyone can go to their supermarket and pick up a package of Shin Ramen and eat it raw.. It's nothing special. Plus, I could hear people around us complain about how spicy it is. The servers should remind customers about the spice level! The servers do suggest ordering about 3-4 appetizers per 2 people, but just ordering one app, and two noodles, it cost us around $35. Imagine ordering 3-4 apps on top of that! you'll be running a $50 bill for lunch. Crazy.\n\nMy coworker and I decided to order the mung bean and burger buns, the pork belly ramen, and the duck pho. Our appetizer came out fairly quickly, although they gave us a pork belly bun instead of a burger one. We didn't complain about it. The buns were quite delicious. They came with a cucumber and cilantro on top. The pork belly was nice and juicy, with the right amount of fat on it. While the mung bean bun was tasty as well. My only quip is that they're pretty small. \n\nOur noodles took much longer to come out. When they finally did, we were starving! I had the pork belly ramen, and I was really looking forward to it. Which was my biggest downfall..... The broth was terribly watery, the egg was waaaay too under cooked for my taste, and though the noodles are made in house, they're not as great as you would hope. Think Hand Drawn noodle type noodles. I know that Cheu Noodle Bar is aimed towards americanized asian-fusion tastes, but that ramen... phew, what a train wreck. I'm too used to traditional Japanese ramen. It's like they took instant ramen beef flavored soup powder and mixed it in vegetable broth. The only good thing about the dish was the pork belly.\n\nMy coworker had the duck pho and I tried some of it. It was definitely not your typical pho. The broth was oddly sweet, flat, and of course, watered down like the ramen. The noodles were the same as the ramen as well. The broth wasn't too terrible, which made it 94547563403 times better than the ramen, but this bowl of pho wasn't handed down from Jesus either. I could go to South Philly and pick up a bowl of pho for $7 that tasted a fajillion times better than Cheu Noodle's interpretation. Again, the meat was the only banger of the dish. The duck was great, and the fois grois meatballs were tender and so yummy.\n\nWould I go here again? maybe if I was starving and I was standing right in front of the restaurant. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because their meat is delicious and their appys aren't too bad either. Please, please, please, fix your soup or just open up a meat only restaurant."

I have already been here twice and I came here the second time all ready to try their maztah ball and kimchi ramen. The server totally sold me on the special and I ended up ordering their pastrami ramen, which was totally amazing. Thick cuts of pastrami topped with a oozy poached egg on a bed of ramen- what is there not to love?  I love their creative trials and I'm so glad they are willing to take risks to fuse white and asian cuisine- totally great.  We also got their Ma po pork shoulder with rice cakes...and I totally loved it.  I was most surprised by how spicy it was. I totally enjoyed it but I was surprised that a \"white\" place would serve something as spicy as that (normal spicy by asian standard).  It was great.  The spicy pork shoulder coupled with sticky browned hot rice cakes...chewy and satisfying...amazing all around.  I also love their specials that includes unique dumplings.  We got the date and pork dumplings topped with crunchy quinoa- again love their creativity that keeps my taste buds guessing! I now cannot wait to come back again just to try with matzah ball ramen open- but I'm sure I'll get distracted and order their special again. YAY! :)"

Even soft, sticky pork belly buns that melt in your mouth are hard to enjoy when you are 20 minutes late from your hour work lunch and you still have to eat at your desk.\n\nMy advice? Go. Get this food. In fact, call ahead no matter what time of day so they have time to prepare your noodles. Because they are, in fact, delicious. (As my cohort pointed out, this is not authentic Japanese ramen, but rather a hipster hybrid ramen.) But please, oh, please don't try to come at peak times and place a big order, because you just might stress out the noodle team."

Mix that with big huge bowls of innovative, very  non traditional ramen... You've got one happy Sari ignoring her diet. \n\nWe came for happy hour with our little girls where some of the signature dishes are just $5, a fraction of the usual cost. We were seated right away, but we did arrive earlier during the 5-6:30 time frame so maybe plan accordingly as the place is super tiny and the later you come, the longer the wait. \n\nWe had the Chefs special which was the dumplings  below. I now see has been added to the menu! \n\n*Tofu wasabi gyoza with herbs in a pickled soy vinaigrette topped with cucumbers. Oh my goodness was this so incredibly good!!!! I asked the manager Melissa why it's not on the regular menu and she said they're adding it so if it wasn't available when you were there, go again and try it! Delish!!!! \n\n*Brussels with kimchee \n\n*Broccoli with the sausage on the side for hubs. He loved it! \n\n*My husband is obsessed with the brisket ramen! The marriage of Jewish and Asian food is one we are very fond of. A big fluffy matzah ball like Bubbie used to make with tender brisket and ramen! Genius. He's been back for takeout almost a dozen times now. It's his new favorite meal in the entire city. He sneaks a bowl every chance he can. (He may or may not have a problem). \n\n*The coconut curry noodles with chickpeas, cucumber, cilantro and lime! Yummy! It was filled with creamy perfection and had a very fresh flavor which is drool worthy! In fact, I'm drooling right now! \n\nOur waiter Shane was super attentive and on the ball. He even gave my girls their fresh juice of the day. \n\nWe spoke with Melissa the manager who is so sweet and helpful. She is your go to girl if you are planning a party! \n\nIt is small as I mentioned, but cozy in a sense. We loved the funky vibes, boasting with personality! The walls were just as mine were in my bedroom in high school so I was totally digging throwback. The ramen art was kitschy. \n\nWe loved the open kitchen and even chatted with the sweet cooks who were making our food right in front of us. Love that! \n\nParking was super easy right out front! Kiosk. \nFree on Wednesday night. Free all day Sunday. \n\nFab Philly Mom says: If your kids are baby foodies and very well behaved, go ahead and bring them! Check the menu first to make sure there's a dish for them. It's definitely not for all kids however! I would say earlier during happy hour or first thing when they open on a Sunday would be your best, least crowded bet."

This is a real Asian Fusion place, the lamb dumplings had just the right amount of heat kick from a chile oil base. The lamb was very flavorful. The real fusion item was the Brisket matzo ball kimchi soup with egg noodles, one of if not the best matzo ball soups I have ever had, again the soup had just the right amount of heat and very tender flavorful brisket. The Broccoli with Vietnamese sausage with peanut topping was a fresh interesting combination that without the peanuts would have been at home on any Italian table.

That said, we somehow got our party of four seated at one of the five tables in under ten minutes.\n\nThe staff was incredibly attentive and friendly, and the ambiance of the place is vibrant and bustling.  Unfortunately the food didn't fully live up to my high hopes and the fun of the interior.\n\nFirst, the good...\n\n- Black Garlic Wings:  This was maybe my favorite dish of the night.  An absolutely delicious sauce coating but not soaking a mound of thick, crispy fried wings.  Not greasy, just salty and garlicky and addictive.\n\n- Ramen Noodles:  I could eat this all day long.  Pork shoulder, egg, sea beans and maybe the most delicious miso broth I've ever had.  A big bowl of out-of-this-world.  The pork was a tiny bit overcooked but I can live with that.\n\n- BBQ Pig Tails with Peach Kimchi:  These were just what they should be: thick nuggets of pork soaked in sweet barbecue sauce.  The peach kimchi... well either I sacrificed that to my sharing partners or I ate it and just didn't taste it, I'm hoping it's the former.  I would have loved if this were more spicy, but still... delicious.\n\n... and then the less-than-good:\n\n- Buns (Pork Belly / Fried Chicken):  I got to sample each of these buns, and I wasn't blown away by either, I'm sad to say.  I loved the little biscuit they were served on but found myself missing the classic steamed bao bun's texture, and the fillings just didn't light up my mouth like a more classic bun does (with hoisin and pickled veggies).\n\n- Dumplings in Chili Oil:  Our dumplings of the night were pork and almond, two flavors I love but have never had together.  They were good... but not out-of-this-world good as I'd hoped.  I love dumplings, pork, almonds and chili oil, but somehow this didn't come together into the bold flavor I'd expected.  Not quite spicy, not quite sweet, not quite salty... just almost-there on all fronts.\n\n- Lettuce Wraps with Foie Gras Meatballs and Plum BBQ:  These were just not good.  Dry meatballs, almost-no plum BBQ sauce, way too much veggie and lettuce to the point that the heart of the dish (the foie and plum) were lost.  Plus they were served in a kind of pile, not in four distinct wraps, all so buried in veggies that it was hard to find how to pick it up and share it.  This one was a miss.\n\nBrisket Noodles:  A moderately good matzoh ball in a chili broth that you'd only know was a chili broth if I told you.  The brisket itself was well-cooked, but the rest was a little bit boring.  The online menu calls it a \"Chile\" broth so maybe it's just a non-spiced South American soup I'm not familiar with... but my money's on that being a typo."

On a recent visit my ramen was cold with noodles that were hard and all stuck together--not surprising since the noodles were sitting on the counter for five minutes before they poured the broth. On another visit the broth of the brisket ramen was so watery I ended up fishing out the noodles and leaving the rest. The taste of everything has changed: saltier, fewer ingredients, less flavorful. Cheu has increasingly taken shortcuts and, sadly, you can tell in the food. While I appreciate the originality of the \"al pastor\" or \"pizza\" dumplings, they are not as good as the more traditional dumplings they used to serve before. One innovation that I love is the Iunch combo which allows you to taste an appetizer for $4. \n\nI'll probably give Cheu another try but if it's so so again I'll just have to be nostalgic about what it used to be."

The staff was friendly and we got our food fast.\n\nI got the brisket ramen and it looked like it was ready for a photoshoot when it was placed on the table. The broth was delicious, but can get a bit overwhelming when you get closer to the bottom. It says that it's a sesame chili broth, but it reminds me more of a soy broth. Sadly it wasn't spicy at all for me and even with the Chile oil at the tables there wasn't much of a change in spice. I would appreciate a bit more broth though.\n\nThe noodles were cooked al dente and the brisket was very flavorful. They broke apart and melted into your mouth, each piece full of savory goodness. I think the matzo ball was a great addition. When you think that the umami flavor of the broth might get a bit too overwhelming, the matzo ball brings you back in by mitigating it.\n\nOverall a small place with a nice atmosphere. My friend had the curry ramen and that looked amazing. Definitely something I want to try next time."

The restaurant reminds me of a dive bar with only 4-5 tables maximum. There is an L shaped bar with enough space to sit and wait for your table. The ambiance was very hipster and the menu looked hand drawn which was pretty neat. After waiting about 10 minutes, we were seated. \n\nThe menu itself is very simple, there were a minimal options for ramen, a few appetizers, wings, and a moderately sized drink menu. I thought the ramen was okay, but it was overly priced and all the add ons were expensive while the portions were rather small. Overall the broth seemed greasy and heavy without much flavor. The pork chashu was on the drier side and the egg over cooked. We were dining at a later time so the bar was overly packed, but service was still exceptionally slow for such a small restaurant.\n\nOverall I wouldn't come here again. Instead I would make the trek out to Terakawa where they have better portion sizes and prices."

Not overly salty, more savory umami flavors. Even a hint of sweetness and smokiness perhaps from the black garlic brought the dish together in a unique way. I was skeptical about the added greens at first but I enjoyed the bitterness with the roasted pork especially. Tasted almost like a bit of southern home cooking mixed with East Asian flavors. I also ordered the bulgogi dumplings and cauliflower Rangoon's during the happy hour. Great happy hour choices. I enjoyed the Rangoon but the goat cheese made it almost too cheesy for me. I couldn't even tell cauliflower was in it though which for some people is probably a good thing! The kale sauce on top of the dumplings was very flavorful. And our waitress was very friendly and attentive. One of Philly's hidden gems is this place for sure!"

This statement was empirically proven at Cheu Noodle Bar.  With that said, our new go-to is the fall-apart brisket ramen, but go big, and add extra pork shoulder.  As a bonus, start with the mushroom bun, but skip the dumplings.  All in all, fresh ingredients and creative twists allows a return visit (or many) to Cheu Noodle Bar."

Out of the two, I couldn't wait to get home and Yelp about one-- the currently unmarked treasure that is Cheu noodle bar. \nWe went a little late on Sunday night, and was surprised at how tiny the spot was. There was a wait, but fortunately it moved quickly and we were seated at the bar in under 10 minutes. Our waitress was cute and attentive, and very familiar with the menu. She was able to point us in the right direction for menu choices, and every dish was more delicious than the last. \nTo start we had sweet and sour cucumber, garlic broccoli, and some sort of eggplant dish. All three were unlike anything I've tasted before, and they were all amazing. Then our main courses came; I got the Duck Foie Gras pho, and he got the lamb neck noodles. Even though the mix of fancy elements with Asian street food was a little intimidating to me, the taste was out of this world. I want to go back right now and repeat this entire dining experience, and my dining companion asked if this place could be visited frequently in our dinner spot rotations. \nEndearingly, the bar faces the the cooking area, and we were lucky enough to watch the head-chef in action. \nThis place was amazing, and I can't wait to get back and eat more of exactly everything I got last time, plus some new sides. :)"

I was letting them know that I basically got food poisoning at their restaurant and that is the response I got. Fast forward, it is 2 days later and I STILL don't feel right.

I got the hand torn noodles with lamb neck,  mustard greens,  and dates. I thought the dish was perfectly balanced; the lamb was rich, the greens were acidic, the dates were sweet, and the noodles were cooked perfectly. It also had the perfect amount of heat. I tried the dumplings as well and thought they were good, but nothing special.\n\nMy only complaints were the wait for food and the prices, and they're hardly complaints. It took quite a while for both my plates to come out which surprised me a little because the restaurant is pretty small and there were three cooks working the line. I certainly wasn't in a rush so it was no big deal and was even given a drink on the house for the wait which was much appreciated. As for the prices, I don't think they're outrageous, and certainly not by center city standards, but the noodle restaurants I'm used to going to are half the price and twice the portion. I do realize the quality of the food and ingredients isn't what you'd get at your standard noodle house,  but I still found it to be a little pricey. \n\nOverall it was a good experience, and I'll probably go back, but I don't think it will become a go-to spot for me."

Weekend dinner always seemed like too risky of a chance, and getting there after work on a weekday seemed like a bit of a challenge, too.

I grabbed a seat at the somewhat cramped bar, and was ready to dive headfirst into some noodles.\n\nI ordered the Brisket Ramen at the suggestion of the employee/bartender/guy behind the bar. It came out really quickly and was definitely delicious. I loved the mix of flavors (Jewish meets Japanese) and the combination of the fluffy matzoh ball and the spicy Kimchi really hit the spot.

It's the ideal setting for grabbing a comforting bowl of noodles. \n\nThe foooood: the menu offers so much variety (ramen, dan dan noodles, coconut curry - it was tough to choose!) I settled on the miso ramen bc I wanted savory, and it was so delicious. I added the bok choy for sake of veggies, but my dish still had the most meat I've ever seen in a ramen bowl. Most of the ramen that I've had tends to come with pork belly over pork shoulder, so I wasn't sure what to expect, but the pork shoulder added a new texture without losing any flavor!

To me, a bowl of ramen is judged by its broth and meat, and both bowls hit home runs in that department. The miso bowl was very rich and flavorful, while the brisket bowl was more spicy with a kick of kimchi. The brisket bowl came with a matzah ball, which I found strange... I didn't care much for it, but it did soak up the broth fairly well. The eggs they put in both bowls were really soft.. like not just runny yolk, but runny erythang.. Only the miso bowl came with the egg; the brisket bowl required an add on ($2 for an egg smh..)\n\nAll in all, would definitely come back for ramen fix."

Cheu closes earlier (10?! What is this, Wisconsin?) and had better music going (hip hop vs NuNu's Rock) so we went with Cheu. The food and drink menu was straightforward/limited so I did the brisket noodles and my guest did the chicken bao buns. She loved her buns (I forgot to get a pic...) but my noodles were too tough, the beef broth was water in flavor and the brisket eventually got lost in the bowl of shoe-lace tasting noodles. The dish was labeled \"spicy\" and that must've been a prank. I added half the chili oil to the bowl to wake it up and eventually settled on simply fishing the brisket out of the bowl. Drinks weren't much better. She ordered the Gangsta's Paradise which is so popular, there were 3 more on deck at the bar. So popular that it's prebatched in a plastic jug, even. She complained that it tasted like sugar water; too sweet and not boozy enough. I didn't even want to taste that, lol. I settled on what I assumed was a German wine whose flavor would compliment my \"spicy\" dish. The wine also tasted watered down. Just stock a regular Sauv-Blanc, you all. If both the bartender and I (both industry professionals) can't pronounce it and it's not a memorable pour, why even stock it? Moving on from the bad, Cheu atmosphere was chill and fun. The music was great in the background and the staff was SUPER friendly. We got in there with less than an hour of operating time to go and stayed 15 min past closing and we never felt rushed to leave. The design of the stools and bathroom and the walls was cool, too. But this is a restaurant, not an art gallery. I wouldn't go back to Cheu again. I kept thinking it would be cool for late night beers but even the weekends end for them at 11."

High time for me write a review for this place. \n\nI moved into the neighborhood and one of the top five favorite things about my new location was how close I was to Cheu. Easily under 5 min walk. I had been there a handful of times in the previous years and always loved it, but my new location really helped forge one of the most cherished relationships I've ever had with a restaurant. \n\nI like to think I am adventurous and try new things, new restaurants, etc. But I can't stay away from Cheu. I now eat there an average of 4 times a month. And I really only eat out 6-8 times a month. \n\nAwesome decorations and never too loud. Very intimate, not a lot of seating so the wait can be long. WORTH IT. (especially as now I can mosey up, put my name in and go back to laying in my bed thinking about the food). HIGHLY recommend sitting at the bar as you can watch them work their magical ways and stare at things you don't know and ask 100 annoying questions. They always answer them so kindly. Even after consuming an enormous meal, I'll see them make a new app or entr\u00e9e and desire it. \n\nOn to the food. I have never had anything bad here. Again I have eaten here many many times. Always good. \n\nTheir Black Garlic Wings are superb. The perfect crisp and the perfect amount of sauce. \nGrilled Scallion Ragoon- delicious. Never think of goat cheese when thinking of Asian inspired cuisine but it works, so creamy and takes on the other flavors in the most beautifully balancing way. \n\nThe Yakisoba. I am ashamed to admit how many times I have gotten this dish. One of the best dishes I have ever had (and it's always good). Perfect pan-fired noodles so they are both soft and crunchy, right amount of lamb to not be overwhelmed and not want more. The yogurt sauce on top is a surprising yet perfect touch. One time I was so hungover so I got it to go, swear it suddenly cured me. There is magic in this bowl. \n\nTheir Ramen bowls. Again delicious. Nothing bad to report, great if in the mood for a brothy bowl. \n\nP.S. Follow them on Instagram. Super fun posts and they post their specials which are always creative and intriguing and never disappoint."

His global approach helped propel him forward in 2013, with Cheu Noodle Bar.\n\nThis isn't Philly's version of Chef Andy Ricker of Pok Pok fame. In other words, this isn't just a non-Asian chef who's simply doing great Asian food. It's a true melange of cuisines. And why not? There are common and, more importantly, complementary elements from both ends of the culinary spectrum. \n\nAnd with the newly opened Bing Bing Dim Sum from the partnership of Chef Puchowitz and Shawn Darragh, I thought it was high time I finished up this review of the original Puchowitz-Darragh production!\n\nWhite Peach Mint Iced Tea [$3]\n\nWhile the mint could have been more pronounced, I appreciated the unsweetened and subtly saccharine approach of the white peach iced tea.\n\nCheu Fries [$8]\nMiso truffle aioli, fish flake\n\nThe Cheu fries featured smoky bonito fish flakes on top. Asian poutine? Count me in! While the oft-decried combo of cheese and fish wasn't in this dish, an umami-laden blend of miso truffle aioli replaced the curds. Perhaps a nod to the way the Japanese love mayo with pretty much everything? The fries could have been a bit more crisp, but each bite offered the epitome of umami.\n\nBlack Garlic Wings [$10]\nShisito peppers, lime, cilantro\n\nIf there's one dish to try besides the ramen, it's the black garlic wings. There's a bright punch of flavor from the juicy wings - spicy, sweet, salty, and savory - it's all there. The black garlic definitely emphasizes the sweet and savory elements, but it's the combination of cilantro and lime that really makes the dish. There's some additional texture coming from the sesame seeds and the accompanying shishito peppers are nicely smoky. \n\nPork Belly Bun [$3]\n\nWe decided to try one of each of their buns as well. Obviously the pork belly is always a must order for me. Realistically though, this was not the best iteration I've had. The pork was definitely gluttonous, but there was a lack of seasoning that rendered the flavor and texture of the pork rather one note. I definitely prefer the traditional bun as well. \n\nCheeseburger Bun [$3]\n\nTo their credit, this was a decently moist slider. However, for $3, it seemed rather lackluster.\n\nMushroom Bun [$3]\n\nThe shiitake mushroom bun was nice and offered prototypical flavors founded in most Asian mushroom-based dishes. \n\nYakisoba 2.0 [$13]\nShrimp, shiso verde, charred corn, radish \n\nOn a brighter note, the GF really enjoyed the yakisoba, especially with the addition of the charred corn and thinly sliced radish. The shiso verde and scallions helped to cut through the richness of the well-coated and al dente noodles, with juicy bits of shrimp studded throughout.\n\nBrisket Ramen [$13] with Pork Belly [$3]\nMatzo ball, kimchi, sesame chili broth\n\nIf there's something to get at Cheu Noodle Bar, I would recommend the brisket ramen, with the added addition of pork belly. Might be going overboard on my end, but come on now, does it get better than this marriage of Jew-Asian cuisine. You've got pungent kimchi providing some balance to the weight of the matzo ball. The richness of the porkbelly and the broth is punched up by the textural beefiness of the brisket. The noodles have good bite and seem to soak up the umami of the broth. \n\nThe vibe of Cheu Noodle Bar is a bit hipster-Brooklyn-too-cool-for-school, with creative takes on comfort cuisine. Do try the black garlic wings and definitely check out that ramen!"

The only downfall of this place is the size of the restaurant itself. It is tiny and only has a couple of tables and limited bar space.\n\nOtherwise I most recently had the corn Rangoon which was filled with creamy, cheesy, godlike filling that erupts in your mouth once you bite through the crispy, crunchy exterior of the shell. The garnish on top delicately dressed the dish like a bow tie on a tuxedo. It is the perfect compliment. The pork dumplings are soft and tender. With a finish of some sort of spicy mayo that creates the perfect complex flavor combination to release all sorts of happiness in your mouth. The ramen bowls are OUT OF THIS WORLD. I have had the tradition miso with egg and pork and it's impossible to stop once started. Also I have had their brisket ramen which a matzo ball and let me just tell you, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes here. Paired with beer wine or a cocktail and this is a meal to rave about and dream about for years.\n\n\nGO HERE!!!"

The service was great, but I would not recommend this place to someone who is not willing to get cozy with other people, it is a tiny restaurant with very limited seats.  The food was good, I had the coconut curry noodles, and they were delicious.  I was a little disappointed that because of an allergy, I really only had two choices for a meal - but was very happy with what I ate.  The server was accommodating and willing to ask questions, the food came out quick, and they came to check in several times.  The person I was with Yakisoba and absolutely loved it!  \n\nIf I were going to go back, I would make sure to only go with one other person and expect to wait for quit a while, as they are often super busy (a sign of their food being great).  It is also pretty loud, just because it is so tight, so if you are trying to get to know someone, you may want to go elsewhere."

The matzo ball was a real delight, soaking up the solid chicken broth. A bit more broth would've been nice. Not entirely sure why the kimchi was in there; it was decent, but probably needs a bit more pickling/spice to cut through the fatty/starchy flavors of the brisket and matzo ball. But maybe it's just because I'm not a huge fan of kimchi, and in anycase, it was good enough, neither excessively pungent nor alkali-tasting. Noodles were probably not made in-house--sourced from Sun, like everyone else?--but they were cooked al dente, which is a pleasant surprise compared to how most other places cook their noodles.\n\nOverall, a fun and interesting ramen that incorporates non-traditional elements that come together well, unlike other, more unfortunate superficial attempts at Asian fusion. Only real criticism is the lack of lighting in the restaurant; some spot lighting would preserve the (darker) mood of the restaurant while satisfying social media mavens."

The soups and flavorings that they offer are good (I've tried the curry and miso) but the real star is the noodles. The noodles taste so fresh and chewy...and bouncy...and toothesome...I hope I'm getting my point across correctly because I'm at a loss for words on how to describe the noodle greatness. Their chicken wing appetizer is nice as well although the blackened garlic sauce tastes a little more tangy and sweet than garlicy. Not a huge fan of the loaded baked potato (rotating flavors?) dumpling appetizers or the lychee iced tea (weak in the tea flavor and the lychee flavor) but their noodles are good enough to make up for that. \n\nDid I mention that the decor of this place is awesome? A cool mix of rock and retro and Asian, this place made me want to stay and hang out all night. Be forewarned that there is very limited seating though, and you'll probably have to wait a while for a table."

I always stare at the menu of the Whole Foods location (which is now gone :( ) and think to myself, one day I'll make it over to the full menu location. So, I finally had an excuse! Given that it was a cold day, I opted for the ramen, but because I don't eat pork I couldn't get their standard ramen. They told me I could substitute the meat but if the broth is pork-based it kind of defeats the purpose. So I went for the brisket option. I honestly thought that I did not get my money's worth. Sure, there was a lot of food but taste-wise it just wasn't cutting it for me. I thought that the broth was lacking an umami flavor and the cuts of the brisket were MUCH fattier than I was expecting. I thought that they tried to make up for the lack of the umami flavor by drowning it in unnecessary spice. Don't get me wrong, I love some spice, but I don't appreciate when they are using it to cover up for something else. I think for all my noodle needs I'll stick to the places in China town and South Philly that I know best (and/or my own kitchen) to get that ramen that I'm still craving."

        "text": "I went back here for a date night recently and I've decided that I can't let my last review sit at 4 stars- the meal I had was perfection. My boyfriend's first impression of Cheu was warmth and friendliness. The staff chatted with him as he sipped on a beer by himself at the bar (he waited a while for me to bike there from UCity). It's possible they were just being nice because he looked like he got stood up on a date (lol), but he said the hostess and servers kept him entertained the whole time he waited. \n\nAs for the food, he ordered the yakisoba (subbing tofu for chorizo) and I got the coconut curry with soft egg added in. As an afterthought, we threw in the crispy corn rangoon appetizer. Let me tell you, it was the best damn afterthought I've ever had. These fritters may honestly be up there with the best things I've ever eaten. The crispy coating is light and delicious, contrasted with smooth and creamy goat cheese and corn filling. Pair it with a tangy red miso, and you have perfection. Highly recommend.\n\nThe yakisoba was similarly fantastic. The queso fresco on top was an interesting choice, but it worked really well with the dish. I swear, the best part of having a significant other is being able to always steal their food. I got the coconut curry, because I remember it being pretty good the last time I ordered it a year ago. I think they've upped their game too, because it was definitely spicier and more flavorful than the first time I tried it. I didn't NEED to add any hot sauce this time (but I did anyway). Pair those flavors with some of the best noodles in town, and you have a great meal. At 40$ for everything, it isn't too expensive either. \n\nI think sitting at the noodle bar really changed the experience for me as well: the location places you at the center of all things fun and lively. Plus you get to watch the chefs do their thing. Cheu noodle bar makes for a great date spot, because the small space brings you in close proximity with your dining partner, but the casual atmosphere also doesn't make things feel stuffy or stilted. Already fantasizing about my next trip here."

The broth on its own is not very flavorful, but when eaten with the noodles, or the meat, the broth shines through. They are harmonious while they are singing kumbaya around a campfire. The noodles were nice and chewy and in great abundance. I thought I would still be hungry after I finished a bowl, but I was wrong. I was beyond full when I was done with the bowl. This is a rich bowl of ramen. The brisket is so amazing! Who woulda thunk it would be perfect in a bowl of ramen?!!"

I mean, really? They just break it up in the bag in front of you and put it in a bowl for you to snack on. \n\nThe buns are delicious, but not $7 for 2 delicious. They are literally the size of macaroons, and I don't mean those gigantic ones either. The bread is a fried potato pancake type deal which was good and for the filling, you get 1 of 3 choices (mung bean, burger, and pork belly). I went with a mung bean (basically a flatter fallafel and a pork belly). The mung bean was probably the best, but I'd only pay $1-$2 for that, and the pork belly was dry and overcooked. \n\nI went with the Duck Pho, $13, which seems to be getting the ravest of reviews. The quality of the ingredients are probably pretty high and the noodles are hand made, but there was nothing Pho like about it besides coming with a plate of bean sprouts, basil, and lime. The soup was overly salty and not very good pho broth. The duck meat was sliced thin and pretty good. The noodles... were ramen noodles, not the thin rice noodles. The best was probably the 4 or 5 duck and foie gras meat balls that came with it. It could've used 1 dash less of salt, but it was flavorful. This 'pho' could've used a healthy squirt of hoisin sauce and srarcha. \n\nIt's def a hip joint for asian fusion, but they tried too hard to improve on things already perfected for half the value and double the size. I left barely feeling full from a $20 meal where I had 2 buns and a bowl of pho. Their pho was basically smaller than the small at Pho Ha."

But I love trying new things, and was looking forward to see what unique twists to the traditional they would bring.\n\nI was, however, very disappointed. This being a noodle place, one would expect the noodles to be the star item of the menu. Alas, this was not the case. \n\nWe ordered the duck pho and the pork belly ramen, both of which came highly recommended by our server. (As a side note: both are the owners' \"interpretation\" of pho and ramen - they are very unlike the real thing...) \n\nPurported as handmade, the noodles were unlike anything I had before - very bitter and very gritty. Bland, undercooked - I can take... but this; I've never had anything that tasted so full of baking soda! They completely overpowered and flavored the broth with a strong, non-appealing aftertaste. The ramen broth in itself was much too thick as well. Neither of us could stomach more than a few bites of our dishes, which is a shame because the meat (fois gras meatballs, pork belly), was delicious!! It was just the noodles that ruined the overall flavor. We ended up splitting wings to make up for the noodles, which tasted much better! \n\nThe staff/service at this restaurant, however, are wonderful. The bar layout of this place provides a comfortable & cozy atmosphere as well. \n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a place to eat good noodles - I would direct you to the nearby Chinatown.

That's how cool this place is.\n\nMy friend and I went straight to Cheu Noodle Bar after we finished our last final exam. We heeded other Yelpers' recommendation and ordered the black garlic wings for appetizer. I also ordered a mushroom bun and a bowl of brisket noodle soup because I love to try out different foods, while she ordered a bowl of miso ramen for her entree. Heads up: we loved everything on the table!\n\nAs we were waiting for our orders, we noticed the unique interior. There were beautiful paper lanterns, as well as these cylindrical lanterns that were actually lit up hanging from the ceiling to decorate the place. The cylindrical lanterns have drawings in graphic novel style and enhance the casual ambience. Then our black garlic wings arrived, and we could feast more than just our eyes.\n\nMushroom bun: I normally hate cucumbers (even when I wear cucumber slices for eye mask; it's the smell I'm telling you), but I didn't mind the cucumber slices in my mushroom bun. The sauce masked the smell of cucumber I hate so whole-heartedly. \n\nBlack garlic wings: There were six wings per order, plenty to share between 2-3 people. The sauce on the black garlic wings was delicious, but the toppings of green onion, cilantro, and lime juice elevated the flavors.\n\nBrisket noodle: The beef brisket pulled apart easily, and the hot broth was perfect to dispel the winter cold. Moreover, the kimchi actually complemented the broth really well. The hand-pulled noodle was not bad. I tried the top of the matzo ball that wasn't exposed to the broth first, and it was good, but when I tried the part that's soaked in the broth, it was as if all the planets in the solar system were perfectly aligned. In another word: magical. Matzo didn't have a strong flavor to begin with, but the flavors of the broth contrasted and highlighted that of the matzo. They're like a couple who is better together than individually. Brangelina, anyone?\n\nMiso ramen: I tried my friend's miso ramen and was glad I didn't order it. It wasn't bad; I'm just not a big fan of pork. I know it's a fusion restaurant, but I usually go to authentic Japanese ramen bars, so... yeah... She loved it, though. To each her own.\n\nWe actually arrived at 2:50 pm not knowing that the place closes from 3-5 pm. However, we were still seated, so kudos to them! This establishment is tiny; I counted all the seats, table and counter, and there were only 20 seats unless there are more toward the back or upstairs that I didn't see. If there really are only 20 seats, well, I wouldn't come here for dinner because it's likely to be packed."

I CANNOT imagine they would approve if they had.\n\nI've been a big fan of Cheu since they opened but it's gradually become inedible. On a recent Friday lunch, I paid $19 ($15+ taxes and tip) for a ramen topped with cold, dry, and tasteless blocks of brisket, unfermented and flavorless kimchi, and a ladle-full of scallions so gigantically cut that not only were they unpleasant to eat but they also turned the broth cold. The broth, if you can call it that, was an infuriating reddish sweetish water with no real taste. You are better off making yourself a Shin ramen at home. \n\nI hope the Cheu people will wake up and start making real food again. If you do, please announce it on the little chalkboard thing you have on the street because otherwise I don't think I'll venture back in here. It seems that I am not the only one. Despite some of the rave reviews here, the place was half empty on Friday at lunch. That would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago."

I found the food to be adequate but certainly nothing special.  Both of our dishes lacked flavor. The ambiance was cute and reminded me of an authentic Japanese noodle bar but our server was horrible. She didn't bring the beer that was ordered and then disappeared. Ten minutes later we saw her serving another table the beers that they ordered. We let the hostess know and she let our server know know. The server then came back and said that she forgot which beer we ordered. When it was time to pay the bill she was also no where to be found so we had to go to the hostess yet again. There are many other places to get better ramen in the city  - - - like nom nom ramen so I am perplexed by all of the five star reviews."

It was small, so we were told that the wait time would be 20 minutes and we were seated exactly in 20 minutes.  Everyone there seemed to work together and the restaurant was a well oiled machine.  I don't know if it was because we were seated at the bar, but they made everything so easy.\nI really couldn't decide between the Brisket Ramen or the Coconut Curry Noodles.  Then I saw their Ramen Release.  It was the Laksa Tantanmen, so I took a risk and I'm glad I did.  It was so good that they should make it on their main menu.  It was chicken sausage, egg with wide noodles and coconut curry broth.  It was one of those dishes I would be craving long after I ate it.  Now that it is colder, I will be back, especially if they have the Laksa Tantanmen!"

Authentic east Asian venue is the theme they're going for! We came in casual clothes (jeans/t-shirt), and almost everyone was dressed down.  Nice and quiet, can definitely have a great conversation with friend. \n\nFood:  They are vegetarian friendly, and have a veggie ramen. I also tried the rangoons, which were delicious. We had the coconut curry ramen again. It was very thick broth as we expected compared to traditional ramen! Less salty, more coconut flavors, thicker consistency. I am not a huge fan of coconut flavor, but with the right amount of chili oil, this was perfect haha. The samosa rangoons had spicy kick with potatoes, goat cheese, and a sweet/sour flavor as well. Legit the description lives up to the taste! \n\nDrinks: Just had water! \n\nService: Quick and helpful! \n\nWould 100% come back.\n\nPro tip - they have wine and beer options\nPro tip #2 - They have happy hour every day!!

Fiance had this on his wish list for a while and after seeing a great show at Walnut Street Theatre we decided this would be our after show spot.  \n\nDownside to this place = cramped!  Small location but it has a lot of heart.  Luckily for us there were two seats at the bar area, but if not we would have either waited a while in an uncomfortable spot of the restaurant or would have had to move on.  However, I am glad we got to sit at the bar top because that is right where most of the kitchen crew are preparing dishes for both in house and take out.  \n\nWe arrived 30 minutes before happy hour ended so we enjoyed a delicious beverage special, wings, and pork dumplings. I would recommend either of these appetizers even when it is not part of a happy hour special.  For the mains we ordered the coconut curry noodles and cumin lamb mazeman.  I would recommend either one of these dishes, but I mainly ate the coconut curry noodles and it was fabulous.  Awesome amount of broth for someone like me who always likes extra broth.  If you have a peanut allergy I would stay away, but if you are a peanut junky this is a great dish.  Noodles were perfectly tender and the seasoning was phenomenal. \n\nI cannot wait to go back here!

They've definitely maximized spacial utilization - the space is simply tiny. The higher price per bowl (~$14) compared to its other ramen counterparts does not equate to superior quality. In fact, much of it was underwhelming. Coworker and I were excited to try their ramen but were disappointed by the lackluster broth/flavor - we ended up not finishing our bowls and each left $20 short & slightly unsatisfied. The open kitchen is cool to watch but at the end of the day doesn't compensate for the forgettable taste. \n\nThis place definitely seems to get a lot of foot traffic as I've seen lines out the door on weekends. Unfortunately I didn't quite get the hype and while Cheu stands out as the only ramen place in the vicinity, with more and more new places popping up that now offer Japanese ramen, the reason for giving it a second chance continues to fade."

I had the Brisket Ramen, which had a decently flavored broth, plenty of noodles, 2 pieces of what seemed to be half-smoked half-roasted brisket, and a very good matzo ball.  I think my issue with the food was that more authentic places just do it better.  Ramen is all about the broth, and the broth seemed to be missing something.  Also, the soy marinated egg did not have nearly as much flavor as other ramen joints.   3.5 stars for the food.  \n\nThe one thing that made me not want to come back was the service.  While the food came out quick (a little too quick if you ask me), when we were getting towards the end of our bowls, they brought the check without asking if we wanted anything else.  My fiance wanted some tea before we left, so they took the check back and brought her tea.  However, our waitress was then looking over our table constantly, waiting for my fiance to finish her tea.  I don't really care if you have people waiting.  This is a service industry; give proper service.  It's not my fault that your boss doesn't pay you a proper wage that you want to flip our table in 35 minutes so you can rush us out the door and get your next tip-givers to come in.  The servers here have seemingly forgotten the enjoyment of dining, and just want to get people fed as quickly as possible and get them out.  If this is what people think of as 4 star service, I feel bad for the future of dining."

The broth was rather salty, it felt like it was scooped from the bottom of the pot. I also had high hopes for the black garlic wings, but they were not very warm when they were served. The sauce was again too salty for my taste and the chicken didn't really have a crispy texture. \n\nLastly, my friend pointed out that there is only one real ramen on the menu."

Now, I would go back and try the ones I haven't tried yet. But, what I did have was the Brisket ramen with the Matzo ball. It sounds good in theory, but it just didn't have that much flavor. I really like the brisket, but I didn't see how the matzo ball really contributed anything other than being unusual. It could have soaked up flavor, but I didn't think there was that much in the broth to soak up. \n\nThe other dish I tried was the sechuan spicy noodles, which I don't remember that many details about since it was so long ago, but I think I liked them more than whatever my husband ordered, because I remember him eating my dish since his was not that tasty. \n\nI think I would go back, and just try some of the other things on the menu.

It is a great spot for a date or even a solo dining experience. Take out was easy to order and they gave the broth and meats/egg etc separately which helped preserve the quality of the dish by the time you got home to eat it. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because it's pretty expensive at $15+ for the misro ramen bowl, especially when the much cheaper Chinatown is not too far off with bigger portion sizes.

Perfect for a date spot or a dinner with a friend, but not for groups; be prepared to sit at the bar and not a table (this is the best seat in the house due to the open kitchen.)\n\nWe started off with a few apps: the black garlic chicken wings, complete with shishito peppers, lime and cilantro- the cheeseburger, pork belly and mushroom bun, and the roasted broccoli with Vietnamese sausage, peanuts and soy. \nThe chicken wings had the perfect crunch and flavor to them; the peppers that accompanied them were not spicy but packed with flavor and added a little extra flair to the dish. Each bun was perfectly seasoned- my favorite being the mushroom (the pork belly's texture was not for me, but the taste was rich and delectable// the cheeseburger was perfectly medium rare and the flakey crust enhanced a simple dish).\n\nWe each ordered a different noodle dish and I was lucky enough to try each one. I wanted a dry noodle dish (not a soupy one) and one with an abundance of vegetables so I opted for the yakisoba noodles. A poached egg lay on top of the mountain of pan fried noodles and when broken and mixed into the dish, enhanced not only the noodles but also the snow peas, asparagus and smoked tofu. I am not a tofu person as I am a raging carnivore BUT this was amazing.\n\nMy sister had the coconut curry noodle dish which had the perfect amount of spice and flavor. But the star of the evening was my sister's boyfriend's dish: the bolognasian. Think of an Asian version of an Italian meat bolognese. I wish I could eat this all day everyday. The hint of horseradish mixed in with the minced pork amplified this dish- took it to another level. The watercress was a refreshing touch and the thick flat noodles gave the dish a different texture compared to the thin ramen.\n\nDefinitely will be back again- I NEED that bolognasian."

That's fine by me, as long as Cheu's interpretation was tasty. However, I was disappointed, even with my bar low. \n\nThe Pork Belly Buns- were good, but a bit on the greasy side because they pan-fried the buns itself. Then you top the pork belly, and you get a the heaviest single bite you can get. Pork belly was good, but I've had better, at many places. I felt like the pork belly itself was lacking something. I added their house spicy sauce (on the table) to cut through some of the greasiness.\n\nThe Pork Belly Ramen (I love pork belly, can you tell?) broth was lacking depth. The noodles were a bit hard and gritty. The sea beans were CRAZY salty. The pork belly was the same as those in the buns- good, but nothing I haven't had before.\n\nIf I were to come back, I would try the other dishes because I do feel the menu items are inventive.

They waste no time and the place runs like a dream.  Generally when you eat somewhere you don't get a feel for what's happening in the kitchen.  I really appreciate being able to watch the magic happen and I have so much respect for the two women I watched pump out so many meals tonight, each more delicious than the last.  One chef in particular was paying attention to our pace for eating and sent our small plates out one at a time so nothing was ever sitting there getting cold.  This allowed us to fully enjoy each plate without feeling rushed.  \n\nWe ordered the following: Wings, 1 mushroom & 1 pork Belly Bun, Broccoli with Vietnamese sausage, Tuna Poke with watermelon, Hot oil dumplings and Spicy crab broth noodles.  Would get all of these time and time again with one exception.  Wasn't crazy about the hot oil dumplings (they reminded me of cheeseburgers) and I didn't taste any crab in the Spicy Crab broth noodles (was still delicious).

The brisket was really lovely and melt in your mouth, who had kimchi and a matzo ball in a savory broth- a weird combination, that actually worked this time around. The yakisoba was spicy and creamy with flat chewy noodles, bits of chorizo- really tasty! Also am glad I tried the fresh juice of the day, which was apple ginger, lemon. \nThe decor is super fun; service was pleasant."

Came here for a quick lunch, and was pleasantly surprised! \n\nIt's a cool atmosphere and definitely gets filled up fast for lunch and dinner as there are only a couple tables and a row of bar seats. \n\nWe got a lunch combo of char shui pork dumplings and the the brisket ramen and an order of miso ramen. I loved the dumplings! Shared them with a fried but next time I want all five haha. Both ramens were very good! I tasted the broth of both and both had such a mouthful of umami and were extremely rich velvety. The brisket ramen was interesting in that it comes with a matzo ball. The brisket was tender too and paired perfectly. \n\nDefinitely will be back to try the other noodle bowls or for take out!"

Outdoor seating was available, menu looked awesome, and the timing worked, so off we went. \n\n(When we sat down, we took off our masks to chat, but when the server came by, she asked that we put them back on as we'd be doing most of our talking then. All of us realized she was exactly right and appreciated the comment and concern. I report this only to emphasize how conscientious Cheu was being, and that we were appreciative.)\n\nAnyway. The food. Outstanding. Looked delicious, and tasted even better. Every bite of my dish (Cold Dragon Noodles, which I highly recommend) burst with flavor. The vegetables were fresh and crisp. The noodles were cooked to perfection (not mushy). I didn't try my kids' dishes (because Covid), which were the Sichuan Spicy Noodles and the Brisket Ramen, but I can report that they enjoyed every bite as well. I also had a maybe jasmine, maybe lavender, iced tea that was crisp and refreshing (and not too sweet). \n\nOn top of that, the service was perfect. I have a food allergy, and our server checked and came back with a list of foods I should avoid. I got to sample the iced tea before ordering. And our food came out probably within 10 minutes, so no waiting. We never felt rushed, and never felt ignored. Just right!\n\nBonus: Cheu isn't far from Old City/South Street, so we got to explore a nice area after our delicious meal. \n\nI'd come back here in a heartbeat. Super experience all around. Loved it."

I appreciate that they are housemade, and I understand they are not meant to replicate any form of \"authentic\" Asian noodles, but what happens is that they are a bit too hard to blend in together with the excellent broth. It's like the noodles and broth each do their own thing in your mouth. I've mostly ended up leaving the noodles and drinking the broth--which is excellent, just like the deep, delicious Korean broths my mom makes."

Much less brothy.\nBoth ramen dishes tasted good. Fresh noodles, but nothing was mind blowing. Nothing was worth $13 a bowl, especially the inattentive service. We went on a Sunday afternoon that was not busy (because usually this place is VERY packed since it's small).

I don't eat meat so I didn't try it, but I'm pretty sure it was good because he cleaned up the whole bowl!\n\nWould recommend this place if you're looking for a quick meal.

Pretty sure Shawn was my server part of the time, and he was super friendly.  I tried the dumplings in chili oil which were a brisket, onion, and date combination.  These were some of the best dumplings I've ever had.  They should do dim sum on the weekends.  I also tried the ramen which was a huge bowl of noodles, egg, pork belly, and sea beans.  I've been to Japan, and I know they aren't doing traditional food, but all I really care about is taste, and this was really good.  It didn't taste too salty either, although I got really thirsty in the afternoon so I suppose it was on the saltier side.  A lot of people around me had the brisket noodles, and someone ordered the BBQ pork and kimchi burrito which looked awesome.  The kitchen is totally open so you can watch everyone cooking.

Its a fusion restaurant so its got that intimate Japanese Noodle Bar feel, but twisted on its head so that its a lot more trendy and hip. The food is fantastic and actually blew me away the first time I had it and came back chronically. The only reason I give it 4 stars is due to the pricing, I feel like youre overpaying a bit for ramen, but alas TREAT YO SELF!\n\nFood Quality - The food is pretty spectacular at Cheu. Its an Asian fusion restaurant so if youre looking for some traditional noodles/ramen I would go elsewhere. I have yet to try something I havent liked, but my favorites go to the brussel sprouts, dumplings and the pork shoulder ramen. \n\nAmbiance - Cheu is a bit of a tight space and definitely has a trendy/hipster vibe to it. They have bar seating and a few tables and have all sorts of cool little trinkets laying about. I personally like sitting at the bar because you can see them preparing all the food. Fair warning, its usually packed unless you pick the right time or get lucky. i would limit yourself to small groups for this place. \n\nPrice - $$ - You can spend a lot of money pretty quickly at Cheu. All the dishes are about 10-15 dollars (including the appetizers), add a drink or two there and youre well on your way to a 50 dollar meal for two. \n\nService - The waiters were great and havent had a bad encounter yet. Ive actually gotten a couple complimentary dishes as well which is awesome! Honestly, Im not really sure why though, I dont go often enough for them to recognize me (unless theyre that good??). Either way, free food is always a bonus.\n\nPS - if you really like cheu, then you should try bing bing dim sum, another restaurant in south philly owned by the same owners!"

Absolutely not. I love food though. First time going and I was glad that we went during weekend happy hour. Yes for a couple hours on the weekend, they have a couple dollars off on apps and drinks. It is lovely. \n\nThe place is very intimate with a bar area that looks into the kitchen and no more than 8 tables. We were promptly greeted at the bar with a smile. They have two or three taps and of course to melt my heart they had Tired Hands on draft!! We also ordered the beef dumplings. It was a pleasure to watch the cooks prepare in house and to go orders. The dumplings had a uniquely seasoned flavor with kale chimichurri mixed with the succulent beef. The real deal was the miso ramen. The broth did not seem too salty and the charred corn with the pork shoulder was heavenly. I did not need to add any extra condiments to the ramen itself. Perfect temperature as well! My wife ordered the coconut curry noodles with shrimp. It was very good as well, but not sure if I could handle that intense, thick and rich curry flavor for a giant bowl. \n\nOverall pretty awesome. Will likely get miso ramen again when I come back. Also I need to try the black garlic wings. They looked so good! Beautiful place."

We also split the beef dumpling appetizers, which I think were pretty solid. \n\nAs far as the ramen (~$14 each), I thought the noodles were good and I could taste all the different things going on, which is a nice change of pace from ramen places where everything sort of melds together into mushiness.

Happy hour is Monday-Friday from 5-6:30, which is when I came to catch up with two friends over drinks and ramen. \n\nThere's limited seating, and you can't sit at the bar while waiting for a table to open up, as it is reserved for sit-down eating. No problem - we grabbed a drink and waited standing up! However, the one downside: there is very limited standing room. The three of us were against the wall, and had to dodge around waitresses every so often when they came out with new dishes. While waiting for ~40 minutes, this became a little irritating, and the reason I knocked the rating down. \n\nThe drinks were good! My favorite was the TEEN SPIRIT (tequila, aperol, lychee, & lime). \n\nWhile waiting, the kitchen accidentally made an extra order of the mojo dumplings, and we were lucky enough to be treated to those - which helped soothe our rumbling bellies. SCORE!\n\nFood: \nMOJO PORK DUMPLINGS ($7) // five dumplings filled with pork, and sitting in a flavorful, sweet & spicy sauce. I;m not sure what it was, but there was definitely a spice in the sauce that gave it its MOJO!\n\nBLACK GARLIC WINGS ($10) // Crispy coated wings bursting with flavors - there's cilantro, there's garlic, there's sesame. The wings are full of juicy & flavorful meat.\n\nMISO RAMEN ($14) // A classic take on Ramen. A warm bowl of broth & noodles, with shredded pork shoulder, a soy egg, black garlic, & mustard greens. The noodles were perfectly cooked without getting soggy, and the pork was tender. Definitely a good & hearty bowl of ramen perfect for a cold winter's eve.\n\nBRISKET RAMEN ($14) // Japanese food meets Jewish food, and births Jewanese ramen. This was a unique take on the classic dish - there were traditional ramen falvors (kimchi, sesame red chili broth), and then some unusual ones - brisket ramen & a large matzo ball. It was fun to see this twist on Ramen! \n\nOverall, the food was incredible. Cheu packs in plenty of flavor into each of their dishes. I'll definitely be back, but will probably go at a less popular time - to avoid the small waiting area!"

Very good and a tad spicy. The green beers and garlic wings are also pretty good. \n\nI rotate between two bowls of Ramen. First is the more traditional Miso Ramen which is very good and topped with pork shoulder and an egg. Second is the Brisket ramen which incorporates Jewish deli food, topped with beef brisket, an egg and a giant matzo ball. May sound crazy but it works perfectly. This Ramen dish is spicy so be aware. The ramen broth is amongst the best in Philadelphia in my opinion, rich, flavorful and not too salty. \n\nThe restaurant is very small so expect to wait. Service is always fast and friendly. It's not an appropriate place to sit for hours and chat. Love that they have rotating beer taps with local brews. \n\nMost of the time now I get takeout from Cheu. The food is always just as good as eating in the restaurant. Ramen is well suited for takeout. They do the takeout orders very quickly so never a long wait. A good way to skip the lines eating in. \n\nIf your a ramen traditionalist like me, give Cheu a try with an open mind, you won't be disappointed. \n\nRecommended\n\nBK"

Much better than the last time I had tried them. The sauce was a perfect mix of spicy and sour, and the cucumbers were crunchy and refreshing. But there was too little topping for the noodles and by the time I made it through half the bowl, I only had noodles and sauce.

Why go here when you can get the real deal (and a MUCH more angelic bowl) at Terakawa for way less dollar signs?\n\nMaybe it's not fair to compare the two: Cheu is very obviously going less for authenticity and more for playful experimentation and unique flavor marriages. But in my mind, Chinatown and other pockets of immigrant communities scattered throughout Philly will always do it better.\n\nAnyway!

They were definitely fall off the bone (not sure if I want that from a chicken wing vs. ribs).  The chicken wasn't crispy, but soft.  Good flavors, but I wouldn't say best in philly.  \n\nOrdered the miso ramen - it was ok for $14 bucks and wasn't full by the end of the meal. The broth is a bit too sweet for me.  The brisket was tender, soft egg was a good touch.  \n\nNot a bad place, but I don't see myself urging to come back here."

It's good, but I really hate waiting! But we're going with 5 stars because I think when you weigh the components: food, atmosphere, service, and price, it all makes sense and adds up to Cheu.\n\nLet's focus on the food first -- for vegan/vegetarian options, the menu is well marked for veg things and things that can be veg which is awesome. The food is very tasty and comes out fast.\n\nI've had the coconut curry noodles and the Sichuan fat noodles, and would recommend both -- possibly the fat noodles a bit more because I love those noodles.\n\nIt's got a good atmosphere, well done for a small space. While it's tight, once you're sitting down you really aren't encumbered by it (tables near the bar may disagree). The service is good, although I will say that the last time I went, our server forgot to put in our order, but the food comes out so fast that it didn't make a huge difference to us. Prices are pretty much what you'd expect, more expensive than say, Chinatown, but makes sense for this sort of place. Recommend!"

The visit was an overall nice experience, if not a bit disappointing.\n\nThe brisket ramen had a delicious flavor with the red chile broth, the matzo was perfect, but my brisket had a huge vein of fat in it and there were only two thin slices of it; for a steep $14+tax, I wasn't even full. \n\nSomeone else has it right that this is a dive bar meets ramen joint, which should turn out to be a good, charming thing. However, you typically feel good for that value you get for your money at a dive bar, yet most ramen joints are inherently overpriced.\n\nIt's a cute place, but the room here is tight, with very few tables; so you are probably going to sit at the bar, squeezed shoulder-to-shoulder while feeling cramped in an awkward situation with others. At least our visit was not in the middle of a mad rush of diners, and we could relax.\n\nCheu is \"A-OK\" (3 stars) for an occasional treat, but it's a stretch to be a \"huge fan\"."

I was excited by all the good comments about the pork belly.  \n\nThe place itself is pretty small and cozy.  I love the lamps over the bar!  My party of three were seated at the bar (and YES, there are coat hooks under the bar).\n\nI ordered a pork belly bun to start off with.  It is really tiny, like the size of a two bite brownie.  I wasn't really expecting such a fried and greasy \"bun\" or like some flat fried  dough.  There was a sauce inside along with cilantro and pickles with the pork belly.  Honestly, I couldn't taste the pork belly with all of that greasiness.  It was pretty disappointing.  \n\nWe also order the black wings.  While it was nicely crisp, the sauce was super potent while the actual chicken had no flavor.  We also ordered the brisket ramen and the pork ramen.  I didn't like the super super soft poached egg, borderline gross.  The broth had a nice kick but the noodles were chewy.  Brisket was tender but matzo ball was weird and unappetizing..like a wet sock.  Nothing special about the pork ramen broth.\n\nWhile the servers were really nice and the place is still a BYOB (for now), the food wasn't my cup of tea.

This is a reduction on value, rather than the quality of the broth and flavor.  I consider myself well-traveled in terms of ramen bowls.  I have gone to NYC (the king of ramen spots on the East Coast) and have been to several highly rated venues that charge you the same amount as a bowl at this spot and include a whole slew of additions in addition to the meat and broth. \n\nThis is a good spot but it leaves much to be desired.

Their pop-ups last year were apparently a smash success, with a line down the street, so we made a point of stopping by Cheu early on opening day to see what the excitement was all about.\n\nWe arrived exactly at opening (3PM), and were immediately seated at the counter with a few others (there are also several tables, for  total of ~30 seats).  It was mostly full by the time we left, but there was rarely a line, and we left before the dinner rush.\n\nBetween the two of us, we tried (see photos):\n\n~Complementary spiced crumbled instant ramen, fairly spicy, and something David Chang would appreciate (if you watched 'In the Mind of a Chef' on PBS).\n\n~Garlic black wings with shishito peppers ($8/4)--Actually we got 5, 3 drumettes and 2 wingettes, which were crispy, meaty, with a light dose of a sticky sweet soy sauce, and some mildly spicy peppers.  My favorite dish, I could make a meal out of these.  KILLER!\n\n~Pork belly and hamburger buns ($7/2)--We could choose any combination from 3 different buns (including the mung bean that we didn't try).  These are tiny two-biters that look smaller than the photos I've seen online, but are very tasty.  The Angus beef was topped with Wisconsin cheddar and house-made pickles.  The pork belly was also topped with pickles.  The buns are a bit strange, a bit like tiny English muffins, if that makes any sense, toasted in a skillet.  My favorite was the pork belly, which like the pork with ramen below was melt-in-your mouth.\n\n~Pork belly with house-made ramen noodles, egg, sea beans, greens ($12)--A very very intense broth (I suspect borderline too intense for some), but overall a very good dish.  The ramen was perfectly al dente and the egg appeared to be soft poached.  A good sized bowl, but not huge.  I added in some of the pho fixin's below.\n\n~Duck pho with foie gras meatballs, turnips, fixin's--I only tried a little of this, but it seemed like the pho was pretty similar to the ramen above.  Thinly sliced, very tender duck, and melt-in-your mouth meatballs, although I can't say I got any foie flavor.  The broth is much milder than than the pork belly's above.  Comes with the usual pho accompaniments of basil and mung beans, lime, and also pickled white radish (I think).  Of the two noodle dishes, I think I preferred the lighter broth of the duck pho.\n\nCheu's mish-mass of Chef Benny's whatever \"I think tastes best\" manages to avoid the ongoing 'Raman Wars', where ramen is stylistically divided into smaller and smaller subgroups and aficionados endlessly (and nonsensically) argue about which ramen shop more is more authentic.  Come on guys, who cares if it is 'authentic', if it tastes good?  And Cheu's noodles definitely taste great!\n\nOr maybe Cheu defines a new subgroup: 'Philly Style' ramen!\n\n[Speaking of 'Raman Wars', to reviewer #3, Ron N, who is apparently an expert on what is and is not ramen, that \"asparagus\" you didn't like is actually sea beans.  But it does kinda look like asparagus, which would be really weird, ramen or not.]\n\nCurrently BYOB (we brought some Guinness), with sodas, etc available, but planning to get a liquor license (big orange placard on the door).  Service was quick, friendly and efficient, with Shawn greeting customers at the front.  Parking is fairly easy in a few local lots.\n\nSome nice photos and background from Zagat:\n\nhttp://blog.zagat.com/2013/03/sneak-preview-cheu-noodle-bar.html\n\nCilantro!"

My mother was with us and doesn't usually venture too much out of her comfort zone for food so we asked for some recommendations and her and I shared the curry noodles with an egg.  My husband got the brisket noodles with an egg.  The brisket is noted as spicy but it wasn't really, but the curry was not labeled spicy and it was very spicy!  So that was the only thing, maybe put a spicy symbol next to the curry.  The waitress was a delight and I told her so.  Everyone was so friendly, it almost felt like I was at home!

I can't compare the food at Cheu to authentic ramen, but I really enjoyed all of the food that I ate here. The Brisket Ramen was my main course and it was delicious; the meat, the soft egg (I added for an additional $1), the noodles, the matzah ball, and the broth all combined for a perfect meal on a cold night. No complaints about the pork Pizza Dumplings or the Black Garlic Wings either, those were a really nice way to start our meal. I also tasted a bit of my friends' meals, the Miso Ramen was excellent, but the Crispy Pork Belly Rice Bowl, while not bad, had too much pineapple flavor for my liking. \n\nCheu had a really funky, laid back vibe that I was definitely into.

The black garlic wings are excellent, and things that sound odd on paper, like the sweet potato rangoon and pizza pork dumpling, work just fine on plate, the latter especially with the chili oil provided on all the tables (I would have liked the goat cheese on the former to have stood out a bit more). But it's the ramen bowls which the place obviously sinks or swims on, and they are pretty masterful. I particularly enjoy the way they so effortlessly incorporate things I don't like much on their own - cauliflower in the coconut curry soup, kimchi in the brisket - into delicious meals where they feel completely natural and necessary. As of now, the brisket with matzo ball edges out the coconut curry (with pork shoulder) as my favorite thing on the menu, but from what I've seen it's hard to go wrong here. The spicy stuff is never obnoxious - spice is always just an element, not a crutch, and all flavors pop wonderfully. Looking forward to trip #4."

Menu changes (bring back the hand torn!) but always yummy. Can be a bit of a wait cause it small and they don't do reservations, but that's just cause the food is awesome and they don't need to. Go on the early side or during the week and keep the party small and you won't have too much trouble."

They called us just as we were getting served to let us know our table was ready (15 min later). We explained the situation and drank as fast as we could to get the table...which they held for us. So nice! \n\nThe food was delicious!  I highly recommend the brussel sprouts and butternut rangoon as apps. The coconut curry noodle bowl was tasty too. Prompt service. Delicious cocktails. No complaints!"

Friendly staff, awesome decor, good prices, absolute gem. I've also had the Coconut Curry noodles and the Brisket Ramen, both excellent as well. Love Cheu!"

        "text": "I love noodles, but I'm not sure what all the hype is about here. 1 1/2 hour wait to get in. No exaggeration. Then when we got the call that our table was ready we had to settle our bill at the bar we were camped out at. Apparently we weren't fast enough. We got another call in a couple minutes to see if we were on our way.\n\nInside everyone was nice. I liked the mix of classic rock & classic hip-hop. The menu was straight forward. I enjoyed the pork & mushroom \"buns\" best. FYI: they're actually tiny sandwiches & if it was less crowded & easier to get a seat I'd come back just for beers & buns.\n\nI thought the dumplings were fine, but a bit too greasy. The brussel sprouts were nice in a 2014 kind of way. The miso ramen was also fine, but it wasn't breath-taking. \n\nTowards the end of meal I felt pretty rushed to get the rest of our food to go. I guess they have no choice w/ the huge wait. Oh, wait, they could take reservations."

I do wish there were more ramen options (last time I went there were 2 ramen options and everything else was some kind of noodle variation). I am not a fan of the miso broth. I know miso is the \"basic\" of all broths but the one here is a bit too basic. Overall, not my recommended place for ramen. \n\nI will say their black garlic chili lime wings are incomparable to anything else. They do get a gold star for that!"

I've only tried this place this one time so maybe other dishes are better but I bet the price is still unreasonably high for a cheap noodle dish."

        "text": "Another disappointing ramen outing on the East Coast. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the plethora of awesome Japanese restaurants out in Los Angeles, but alas I continue. \n\nCame here on a Saturday evening, perhaps 7:30. Come inside and the restaurant as pretty filled and busy, generally a good sign. Interesting atmosphere; a little hipster-esque but the music was an nice mix of genres which was appreciated (example: Dr. Dre - The Next Episode, a West Coast classic). Service was nice and friendly all night. My waiter at the bar was extremely charismatic. \n\nUnfortunately the food fell sort of expectation. I am a firm believer that good fusion is extremely difficult to do. Thankfully, I had a dining companion, a recent transplant from China who has never experienced this type of food, with me to discuss thoughts on said food.\n\nBlack Garlic Wings (2.5/5) - These wings were missing texture to them. The texture was equivalent to eating pre-cooked hot wings that were thrown into the oven for 45 minutes which was extremely off putting. Flavors were bold (and interesting to my friend) and the shishito pepper was a nice addition. Wish there could have been to crunch to these wings.\n\nShrimp Toast (1/5) - Shrimp toast is typically slightly sweet but the shrimp here was lacked flavor. It wasn't seasoned properly to exhume that inherent sweetness from the crustacean.The toast was burnt which led to a bitter, bland tasting small plate. The avocado was lost in the toast and didn't add much. I found the addition of the seaweed to be slightly off-putting as well. Friend agreed that it was a weird tasting dish.\n\nBrisket Ramen (2/5) - Noodles came out molto al dente but got better as the noodles sat in the dish. The amount of brisket in this dish is truly sad.Two slices, when combined, about equal the size of your typical business card. I know this is CC Philadelphia but c'mon. $13 for a noodle soup dish, there should be more meat. It's not as if the accompanying side dishes (matzoball, kimchi) were particularly expensive.The kimchi was a welcomed addition but the matzoball just seemed out of place.The base was just a sad salty/spicy dump. There was no essence in the soup. This didn't taste like a soup that was cooked with bones overnight. It tasted like that powdered shit you ate when you were in college.\n\nPork Belly Bowl (3.5/5) - The saving grace of the restaurant came last. It's really hard to go wrong with pork belly. Served here was the breaded and fried version; the first of this type that I've encountered. The piece we received was decent in size and had a fair amount of fat which gave it great flavor. The sauce, which tasted exactly like hoisin, was at times overwhelming with it's sweet flavor and viscosity, but it paired well with the included sliced cucumber (a classic combination). My dining companion thoroughly enjoyed this dish as well. We both agreed it was the strongest of the night. \n\nFor me, fusion generally comes off as food that I would have made in college when I was high. Here at Cheu, it's unfortunately not too far off. I'll be back to give it another shot when the menu changes up."

I started with the Black Garlic wings, and I could have just sat there and kept ordering wings and made a meal out of it. They were nice and crispy, and delicious!\nThe TV show featured their Brisket Ramen, which is a very unique take on ramen, with brisket, a Matzo ball, and Korean Kimchi. It was A-MAZ-ING! The brisket was fall-apart tender, and tasted great! The kimchi added a nice little zing to it, and the broth had a little bit of a kick, and was also full of flavor. Definitely a must-try.\nGreat service, friendly staff, and awesome food! I'll be back!"
