I'm a vegetarian so I can only personally comment on the donuts and coffee; however, my husband is obsessed with the chicken. His favorite is the buttermilk ranch.\n\nThe donuts are pretty amazing. Paired with an iced coffee and it doesn't get any better. The staff couldn't be nicer- even when they're busy."

Too much of a cake donut taste (which I don't particularly care for).\n\nI can't possibly rate this spot any higher than 3 stars when the greatest donuts on the planet  (Beiler's Donuts) are merely a few blocks away in the Reading Terminal Market."

Neither of which really makes truly great donuts.  So after waiting for the crowds to die down a little, I traveled over to see for myself last Saturday.\n\nIt's a small shop that blends into the surrounding neighborhood. Inside there are a couple of seats at the counter and a wide window well that two people could sit in. I ordered my donuts. I went with the Indian Cinnamon, the caramel banana, the pina colada, and the halva pistachio. The ladies behind the counter worked as fast as they could given the decent sized collection of people waiting for orders and bopping in. My order was processed quickly, and I got my coffee right after I ordered it. The coffee was one of the only things that was a disappointment besides the lack of seating.\n\n Since there was no room to sit, much less stand I took my donuts and coffee out to a park just off of Federal between 3rd and 4th St.\nThe donuts were truly transcendant.  Each donut was a symphony of flavors on my tongue.\n\nThe Indian Cinnamon-Very light on the cinnamon, coated with sugar. Hot, fresh, and so moist that it pinched in half when I started to eat it.\n\nThe caramel banana-A delicious meld of flavors with something added to the banana chips that made them more tasty than I\"d imagined.\n\nThe pina colada-The donut I though I'd enjoy the least. However it tasted like the Rach 3 and Beethoven's 9th all rolled up. A complex mix of flavors that together was truly amazing. And unlike the current generations, I don't use that term lightly.\n\nThe halva and pistachio-the final movement. More subtle flavors that nevertheless worked well. I'd never had halva before, but I liked it.\n\nBelieve the hype. Believe the NY Times article. Federal Donuts makes some of the best donuts I've had."

I ordered the ranch fried chicken and the indian cinnamon donut and both were very good. I also had what I would call their plain donut and it was delicious. The donuts were moist and warm and extremely tasty and were probably the best I have ever had. The chicken was tender and moist and also delicious.\nThe only downside to this place is the size. The restaurant is very small and there is very little seating. The seating is diner style, stools at a counter. This would be a great place for takeout, which they do.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend going here. I would also recommend going early as they tend to sell out fairly quickly in the mornings."

After hear one raving review after another, I said enough is enough and took a walk over...and I was not disappointed (except for one minor factor).\n\nUpon walking in the women behind the counter were so sweet and patient. I told them it was my first time and they were more than happy to work with me while I surveyed the entire menu. Eventually I ended up ordering for my dad and I two chicken sandwiches and two cinnamon sugar \"fresh and hot\" donuts, and a cold brew coffee for myself. This is where the one bad part of my experience comes in: the price. These five items came to $21.60, which I believe is quite expensive.\n\nThe cold brew coffee is soooo good. I feel like most places try to nail it down and can never get it right, but Federal Donuts sure did! It had a very robust coffee flavor.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious; the chicken was juicy with a crispy battered outside, the seasoning was nice and balanced, the touch of sauce was just right, and the potato bun was very fresh.\n\nThe cinnamon sugar donut...just, wow. These people don't lie when they say it's \"hot and fresh.\" It was warm, soft, moist, and loaded with cinnamon sugar. I could easily eat 3-4 of those things in one sitting. At $1.50 a piece you are paying a premium for quality. \n\nDespite the price being a little high, I will definitely be back to try their other varieties of donuts and chicken. 10/10 (or 5/5, according to Yelp)."

A bit messy but that's what wet naps are for. Had a bite of the buttermilk ranch chicken as well. It's like the southern version of Korean fried chicken. Loved the vanilla lavender and Indian cinnamon donuts. When you first break apart that first piece, you can just watch the steam seep out and breathe in that lovely scent. It's a moment... so slow down and enjoy it. There's also cold brewed coffee that's perfect with the donuts. Can't wait to try the fancy donuts!"

But, it was still busy, it can get crowded very quickly with a very small interior. They have five counter seats, and that is about it. While we were there, most of them were there to purchase the food to go, so the seats were not in high demand.\n\nEven though this is mainly a donut shop, they also offer enticing fried chicken. We ordered their very popular Fried Chicken Sandwich, available from 11am. It was smaller than I thought it would be, but I always take quality over quantity. It was juicy, tasty, with a nice little kick to it. We really enjoyed it!\n\nWe couldn't just order chicken from a donuts shop, so we got a couple of donuts from their Hot Donuts selections. We chose Cookies & Cream and Strawberry Lavender. We both liked the strawberry one better, since it had better, stronger flavor. Cookies & Cream was good but didn't have much flavor. \n\nDefinitely a place to visit if you are visiting Philly!"

The \"fancy\" donuts were not particularly interesting to me.  The consistency was ok and the flavors were not very prominent.  I tried each flavor; the caramel banana was the best.  The donuts here are better than chains but not nearly as delicious as I had hoped.\n\nUltimately, to me, this is not a donut destination.

The blueberry was prominent as was the mascarpone was creamy yummy, and i felt that it was the best executed.\n\nChocolate Mint: This was my second favorite as it reminded me of an andes mint.

But then again, maybe not, because I probably would have gone here once a week and put on the Freshman 20 instead of the Freshman 15.\n\nI've only tried the hot cinnamon sugar donut and it lived up to the hype. There's not many donuts that are better than a piping hot one out of the fryer. I can't speak to the other donuts that they have since I've only tried one, but they have 3 flavors of hot donuts: Vanilla Spice, Strawberry Lavender, and Cinnamon Brown Sugar. Get one, get two, or just get them all. I could've probably eaten 2 by myself, and wished I was with more people so that I could have shared more. The hot donuts are pretty inexpensive at $1.50, which is what you'd pay for a non-fresh, stale donut at a grocery store.\n\nThey have fancy donuts for $2.50, which is also affordable since in San Francisco, you get price gouged and end up paying ~$3.50 for special donut. They have maybe 6-8 different flavors.\n\nThey also have fried chicken with different seasonings and glazes, but I didn't get to try it when I visited.\n\nWill definitely be back when I'm in Philly again.

Maybe I should've tried one of the weirder flavors, like razzbery[sic] balsamic or halva pistachio. Or the plainer donuts, like lavender vanilla.\n\nHowever, the chicken was quite good, particularly the dry-rub za'atar. I think the dry-rubs are the way to go, because they really showcase the perfectly-crisp crunchiness of the fried chicken. The chicken breast was juicy and not dry at all, which was great. The chile garlic was tasty too, but it seemed like they were trying to copy Korean fried chicken places and failed to execute it quite as well. The chile was a bit overwhelming in terms of flavor (spice level was fine though), and the fried outer shell didn't hold up quite so well to the glazed coating. They came with a tiny container of Japanese-tasting pickles, and honey-glazed donuts that were not-too-sweet and perfect with the chicken (think chicken and waffles). \n\nOverall though, I was bit surprised about the value we got from this place. I expected to spend a lot of money for not a whole lot of food, but the portion sizes were pretty decent for the price, and the chicken came out hot, fresh, and tasty."

However, I can't give it quite 5 stars despite the hype and my repeat appearances.  The chicken is great quality but I think the seasonings need to be a little stronger.  Harissa is a spice I'm into but the harissa chicken seems too weak on this flavoring. And in a way I feel the same about the donuts.  Again great quality but today I got the vanilla lavendar hot donut and couldn't really taste much of any flavoring.  If I didn't know what is was, I couldn't have told you for a million dollars if it had any flavoring or not or what the flavoring was.

My God.\"  We (my boo and I) pre-ordered 9 fancies and a 1/2 honey-ginger chicken to celebrate Superbowl Sunday.  Pre-ordering is KEY as we went in at 1pm and they had run out of fancies at 9am!  We pre-gamed our fancy donuts & chicken with some hot donuts - 1 of each kind:  Lavender-Honey, Indian Cinnamon, and Appolianaro (or something that sounds Apollo-y).  These 3 kinds were the sugar-coated, sparkle in your mouth type.  They all tasted similar, but the Apollo one was a darker, stronger cinnamon, the Indian Cinnamon reminded me of fall festivals, and the Lavender Honey had a nice clean taste, but you had to look for it.\n\nNow the fancies that we're currently binge-ing on are freaking amazing.  I'm not one to order a dozen donuts every Sunday...I'm no donut seeker...but I'd seek these.  Every single one is so unique from any donut I've ever had and they're unique from each other.  The balsamic-raspberry is in my top 3...it's not artificially sweet and the balsamic cuts the sweetness with a nice tang...the \"halva pistachio\" holds on to the flavor of the nut and would be my #2, #3 would be a tie between the pina colada and the grapefruit with brown sugar.  We also got the caramel-banana and the smore's donuts which were definitely good but those fruity flavors aren't found in your everyday donut and the flavor keeps standing out no matter how many donuts I eat.  I keep eating more.  I'm still eating.  \n\nWe blew through the 1/2 chicken pretty quickly (the donuts are still lingering on the counter) and I'm not a fried chicken seeker either.  The glazed version wasn't sticky but thin & savory/sweet and the chicken inside the crispy coating kept the sweetness of the glaze.  After this chicken I loooooooooove fried chicken.  Well, maybe only Federal's.\n\nI have to credit the boo for finding and ordering from this place.

The chicken wings were moist, but insanely salty...  and I love my food salty, so for me to notice it is saying something.  I ordered half plain and half chili, and the chili sauce made the wings really slimy and they completely lost their crunch (good Korean style fried chicken can still stay crunchy under the sauce).\n\nTheir hot donuts are pretty darn tasty, I'd choose them over the specialty ones.  If I were to pick one donut of theirs that was stellar, it would be the strawberry lavender (had it at their Rittenhouse location).  Hot out of the fryer and bursting with flavor, it was a nice snack.  I'd have that again.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving them 2 stars is because the staff are super nice.

While I loved the Zatar spices best (made me nostalgic for my first zatar exposure in Israel years ago), I think the glazed chickens are just so much more delicious. I can't wait to go back to try the Chile-Garlic glazed or whatever else they have on the menu.\n\nAlso, this review would be incomplete if I didn't mention the donuts. I will say that I'm generally not a big donut person - I love them, they're fabulous, but to me however good they are, they're generally just not worth how bad they are for you. I'd rather have another piece of fried chicken. Ah, but here... the honey donut that comes with all the chicken is so good you can't not have it. And the Halvah donut I tried -- also delicious but nowhere near as good as the honey donut. I need to try the hot donuts which sound amazing -- or maybe I'll just have more chicken instead."

Orange Creamsicle?  Good coffee.  I hear the chicken is wonderful but we were never there in the morning.  They sell out of flavors of donuts, supposedly, so get here early.  Unique, and a staple of any trip to South Philly for the rest of my life, so I'll be eating a ton of donuts."

Since all the fancy donuts had been sold for the day, I settled on a fried-to-order vanilla lavender donut and a black cherry soda.  Both really hit the spot; not to mention I ran into someone I met while I was a first-year student at Arcadia whom I hadn't seen in years!  Nothing better than reuniting and bonding over great donuts and feeling like you're in your friend's kitchen!  I wasn't in the mood for chicken that day, but I am eager to come back and try it, as well as their fancy donuts.  At the rate it's going now, Federal Donuts has great things on the horizon and is well on its way to becoming the next Cheers...where everybody knows your name."

        "text": "Not sure what I can say about this place that hasn't already been said in a few hundred 5 star reviews so I'll just tell two stories:\n\n1.  My first visit to Fed Nuts was last year.  I was talking to one of the owners outside who is a friend of mine.  I was hungry and chicken sounded perfect.  I walked in and ordered a spicy chicken from the super awesome Blake F.... this is how it went down\n\nI pushed open the screen door and my senses were overloaded in fried goodness. My life seemed rather dull and lusterless before inhaling the medley of donuts and chicken.  A familiar face was at the counter and beaming her winning smile.  \n\n\"Hey buddy, good to see you!\" I said.\n\"Hey there, welcome!\" she replied.\nI could barely contain my hunger at this point. If I wouldn't look insane for licking the sweet air, I would have.\n\"Can I get the spicy chicken?\" I said.  God knows I love everything spicy and fortunately, luck was on my side.\n\"You bet, 1 spicy\" she commanded.\n\nI paid and waited for my chicken.  As I was admiring the simple establishment that has nailed the adage, \"Do a few things VERY well instead of a lot of things crappily,\" an old timer walked up and adjusted his worn cover.  He ordered chicken but his fortune was not as mine.\n\n\"Sorry, we just ran out, he got the last one.\"  \nThe seasoned Philadelphian turned to me with a mired glare that said \"you gotta be shittin me.\"  I really wondered if he would wait idly in on a wooden stool and leap for the box of chicken as it offered to me, only to run out the door with a super villain cackle.  Didn't happen though, he left with a donut and I ate the chicken.\n\n2. I ran an experiment where I brought them in to work and let a bunch of people try them.  Invariably, every person would take a bite and say, \"This is like the best donut I've ever had.\""

Not super spicy, but the chicken was moist and juicy - exactly as described. We also got the za'atar chicken, which was great. The crispy chicken kept better than the glazed chicken in case you're going to eat some later.\n\nWe went overboard on the donuts, but the pina colada donut (which I wouldn't have predicted I'd like) was incredible. It tastes like coconut and pineapple - nothing like the cloying sweetness of the drink. The smores and caramel banana donut were only okay (I was expecting a lot I guess), and the pistachio halwa was a bit too much but I should have predicted that given my dislike for halwa. If you like it I think this donut will knock your socks off. The standouts were the hot donuts. All three were super delicious. Its hard to dislike a hot donut, but even still - amazing."

I asked for a fork and the counter associate picked up a plastic fork from under the sink. It was covered in dust and actual dirt.

In fact, I could just order their za'tar dry rub skin and be happy. While the chicken is also good, it's really just fried chicken, and when you order a \"half chicken\" you're not actually getting a half a chicken.

Yes they are small and pricey, but they are also quite rich and made with great ingredients.  The cashier patiently explained the chicken process over and over as each person came in and remained all smiles.  For chicken go at 11:45, get a ticket and wait a little while for your chicken.  The ticket ensures you will get chicken.  We will be back to check out the chicken soon.  It seems this place is doing two things really well."

If the humble donut could aspire to attain artisanal status, they would no doubt be those you'd find at Federal Donuts. The donuts are uniformly delicious, served  warm by the friendly (and occasionally hilarious) staff. They are in fact so delicious, that you'll probably find that far fewer of them make it home than your doctor would recommend. I'd advice you to pace yourself.\n\nThe fried chicken is also really good with a ample portions (and a donut!) in a couple of zesty flavors. Make sure that you have access to a lot of napkins - the chicken is as greasy (in the best possible way) as it is good."

Mine was super banana, chocolate was more of an aftertaste\nCreamsicle Donut~ it tasted like sugary creamsicle if you had on in the 80s.\nDr Brown's Cream Soda~ was really watered down for my liking.\n\nOverall very pleased with this fancy donut establishment. I wouldn't go there all the time, but a really nice change of pace. I believe its $1.50 for the cinnamon, $2 for the fancy. So it was about what we expected.

Haven't tried the fried chicken yet.\n\nTaking a few extra miles and minutes out of an early morning trip to NYC for the day, me and my friends decided we would try the much hyped Federal Donuts. I had been following the opening and rave reviews of this donut, coffee and fried chicken joint with much glee as it seemed like everyone was overjoyed by their experience.... my reaction was, well, pretty so-so. It was about a 20-30 minute wait as this is still the new buzzy eatery for early morning bites, but in the end this treat isn't worth venturing out of the way for. The \"fancy\" donuts are premade and left sitting on trays with no warming light to keep them soft and tasty so the end result of my chocolate raspberry order was a pretty cold offering. Don't get me wrong, it tasted good, but nobody really goes out of their way for cold donuts. On the other hand, if I do return I will stick to the \"fresh\" offerings on the menu that are hot and coated with their respective toppings when ordered. So overall there was enough of a mixed feeling that while I'd say you should try this place if you've been thinking about it, I wouldn't tell anyone to go out of their way for the donuts..... now, on to the chicken!"

I was intrigued by the concept of a place that specializes in DONUTS and CHICKEN....not really two items you generally would put together, but certainly two of many peoples, myself included, favorites!  \n\nThis place ended up offering the exact opposite in my opinion; GREAT chicken, and GOOD donuts.  We got a half order of the Buttermilk Ranch seasoned \"twice fried korean style\" chicken, and I swear...I'm not like a chicken connoisseur or anything, and I haven't traveled the world 'round looking for the best chicken, but in my 30 years of life on this planet, it was the BEST I've ever tasted.  Perfect crispiness on the outside, just the right amount of seasoning without being too much, and the actual chicken itself was nice and hot, and flavorful.  Incredible!!\n\nThe donuts we got were a Sticky Bun, Chocolate Sea Salt and Cookies & Cream.  My fav was the Cookies & Cream, the Sea Salt was damn good, and the Sticky Bun was really good too.  These are the \"Fancy Donuts\" and you better just HOPE they have them left, you gotta get there at the right time (I forget the time exactly, but read other reviews to get a sense), otherwise you're SOL and are stuck with whatever they got left.  The donuts were really good, soft enough and a good texture.  MUCH better than places like Dunkin Donuts (though i'm fond of them...) but not quite as good as a place like Duck Donuts (if you've ever made it to the FAMOUS OBX spots, you're missing out on life).\n\nService was very friendly despite being very busy, which as much as I love philly, i'm unaccustomed to (ever been to Pats/Genos? YEA - opposite of this), and it was a very pleasant surprise to have very nice people behind the counter.\n\nParking was easy enough, there's about 6-8 spots right out front in a little \"lot\" and street/curb parking.  Despite a picture somewhere else from someone, it is NOT \"sketch\" at all.\n\nGreat place overall, and we'll definitely be coming back!!"

The flavors are rich and the freshness of the doughnut holds up pretty well the next day in case you get too many to eat in one sitting. Although more expensive, these are a great occasional treat.\n\nThe sugar doughnuts were tasty, but they were not shockingly delicious in comparison to the region's signature apple cider doughnut. However, they did give me a fresh, warm 6 pack with three varieties. Warm sugar doughnuts are always well appreciated."

Always a fan of breakfasts and baked goods, particularly from a chef who went out of his way to stop by my table to chat when I ordered (er, 'devoured like a viking') the pork shoulder at Zahav, Federal Donuts had been on my 'to visit' list for a while and although my eating plans for the day were substantial I knew walking in the door that I had co-diners throughout the day with whom I'd happily be able to share.\n\nA small space to be sure and not yet busy on a Tuesday morning parking was a cinch and with two bakers plus a young clerk I asked what was best with a typical response, \"everything,\" and sizing up the donuts and realizing them to be small I went with the theme ordering a half-dozen fancy options and one of the made to order hot sugared donuts plus a cup of Federal Blend coffee plus a plastic knife with which to divide the selections.\n\nMaking my way to the street and sipping the vibrant coffee with earthy cinnamon tones throughout I started first with the hot \"Vanilla Lavender\" selection and was instantly quite impressed as the exterior was a bit crunchy while the interior was soft and dense, the floral notes understated while mellow vanilla notes came to the fore.  Moving next to the daily selections of $2 fancies it was a mixed bag (or box) with the same high quality textures as the hot donuts but the flavors far more bold - and sometimes a bit strange.\n\nStarting with the selections I expected to work nicely, Creamsicle, Strawberry Rhubarb Pie, and Chocolate Banana each choice was a pleasant blend of flavors with the same cake body simply wrapped in a different glaze - a fan of cake donuts over yeasted 'raised/glazed' things were off to a good start.  Moving next to the more aggressive flavors, Chili Mango and Pomegranate Nutella both proved to be quite bold and interesting - the former with a bit of heat and the later somewhat akin to a peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwich in flavor.  Far less successful, the Mandarin Coffee was simply not my style - far too much acid with the smoky coffee notes providing little balance.  Overall a really interesting spot with a good vibe and prices far less than many 'designer' donut shops I unfortunately never did make it back for the fried chicken.....though I guess there is always next time."

I like to judge a place on how good they can do simple things before sampling anything else. The donut was good and hearty. What I mean by that is that when I bit into it there was content and I could taste the bread as compared to Krispy Kreme donut which is very airy to me. The chicken was good and came out hot as I got there ten minutes before they started cooking chicken (they start serving chicken at 11). I went with the zsatara. Ok not sure how it is spelled but it was a dry rub of various tasting much like a Mediterranean spice rub used on lamb. It was very good and on my next trip I really want to try their honey garlic."

This small corner-sized store owned by Michael Solomonov (Zahav, Percy St BBQ, Bodhi Coffee), is the latest addition to a series of local eateries that challenges the restaurant empires built by Stephen Starr and Jose Garces.\n\nWe went on a Sunday morning around 1230.  There were no lines, and there was plenty of the famous chicken available.  The BF and I split a vanilla lavender donut and a pomegranate nutella donut.  I got a half order of the Harissa Chicken, and he opted for the Chili Garlic.  We also got coffee, therefore trying each of the menu's three featured items: donuts, chicken, and coffee.  A small wait after we got our food and we sat down at one of the five counter seats inside.\n\nThe donuts are perfect: moist and cake like without being too heavy.  They're also sweet but not too sugary.  The chicken is also outstanding.  The outside is crisp and flavorful without being too crunchy, and the chicken on the inside is warm and juicy, with all of the flavor sealed in.  The coffee is also pretty terrific, but plays second fiddle to the donuts and chicken.\n\nIf you can go when there's not a serious line, it makes the experience all the more enjoyable.  The staff is super friendly and genuine; interested in making you feel comfortable and delivering to you a quality product.  The food is fantastic and it's a great neighborhood spot.

The chicken wings tend to sell out first for some reason.  The frying style tries to copy that of Korean Bonchan chicken with a double fried style.\n\nDonuts: not your fluffy 90% air filled donut like you see @ Dunkin, a donut came included with each half order of chicken and they were the plan kind (kinda sweet+sour) and had a solid consistency to it.  Definitely a unique taste.  They didn't have the fancy donuts during our Saturday dinner visit.\n\nService: friendly and plan on waiting 15-20 minutes for your order.

So a few weekends back when we happened to be in the neighborhood, we finally had our chance! \n\nWe walked into the small storefront and were greeted by a warm smile behind the counter. We settled on a half order of the buttermilk ranch chicken and six chili garlic style wings (which we were told were excellent choices btw.) The lovely lady behind the counter told us she'd cut us a break and just charge us for the whole chicken instead of two halves to save a buck. \n\nThen of course, we needed to decide on donuts. Lots of their specialty donuts were sold-out so we stuck with the classics. I ordered the Indian Cinnamon and Bry went with the Apollonia Spice, then as if our day couldn't get any better, the sweet lady behind the counter told us she would throw in the Vanilla Lavendar for free, just so we could try it! Bam! They just earned themselves a lifelong customer. The inside of the store is minimalist and charming, there are about six seats at the counter so if there is an open spot, snatch it up quick!\n\nThe buttermilk ranch was my absolute favorite. I loved the flavor and crispiness of the outside and the chicken was crazy moist on the inside. I've had dreams about it every night since I first got my hands on it. \n\nPlease note: and we were newbies so we had no idea, with every order of chicken you get a tasty honey lemon donut to go along (pictured below.)

        "text": "Long trip for minimal satisfaction. To start... Federal sells two of my favorite foods. I LOVE donuts. I LOVE fried chicken. How could this be any less enjoyable than a free trip to DisneyWorld?\n\nMy six year old nephew was off from school for some unknown occasion, so we decided to go on an adventure. It was my understanding that chicken tickets were given out beginning at 10:45 (which made sense to me since the normal lunch rush is between 11am and 1pm), so we arrived around 10:30, appetites whetted.\n\nFail. \n\nChicken tickets aren't available until 11:45.\n\nI was slightly turned off by the very matter of fact \"chicken's not til 11:45\" response I received, rather than a mildly apologetic & explanatory \"I'm sorry but our chicken isn't ready until noon,\" but I didn't come all that way for nothing (nephew lives in Cheltenham), so, we decided to order donuts.\n\nDouble fail.\n\nFederal Donuts are fancy.\n\nI had no prior knowledge of the menu, and came in with visions of some fantastically hefty, \"old fashioned,\" \"authentic\" boston cream doughnut (yes, what i envisioned was a doughnut, not a donut) blessing my mouth and belly, and nephew just wanted a simple chocolate donut.\n\nWe sat down to eat our donuts (Appolonia Spice for me, chocolate raspberry for the little one), as I debated in my head whether or not I was willing to wait an hour for the chance to buy chicken.\n\nThe decision was made for me, as we were in the way of the people trying to put cream and sugar in their coffee, plus it began to get uncomfortable in the small space as more people trickled in to wait for chicken tickets. (You try hanging out in a silent room full of people with a 6yo.)\n\nUltimately, I thought my donut was pretty tasty, but after one bite, nephew decided to put his away \"for later.\" He never even thought about that donut again, except to decline it when I offered it as an afternoon snack. I can't offer an opinion because I am repulsed by all things raspberry and didn't taste it.\n\nAs much as I wanted to love Federal Donuts, and wanted to adore the experience, the highlight of the day was nephew's excitement at seeing the NBCPhiladelphia van outside because we arrived as the Ten Show was wrapping.\n\nStill mad I missed the chicken."

The crunchiness of the chicken is lost in the glaze- kind of like my dignity while i waited in line.  The dude was giving out numbers and said i could only order one whole or a half portion per person- that's it. He said he had to be \"fair.\"  Since when is capitalism \"fair?\" Sell me the freakin' chicken. However, now that i've had a taste, I realize he actually did me a favor. Im not saying it tastes bad- because it doesnt. Im saying that it's not bad fried chicken for 2nd and Federal/South Philly.  There are MUCH better fried chicken places in the city that dont come with the hype, the wait, and the little post-it notes with numbers. You cant just fry chicken and call it good \"fried chicken.\" There is an expectation when someone says, \"you want some fried chicken?\"  And that expectation includes... a nice textured coating, some fundamental seasonings, the perfect amount of juiciness in every bite... and it most definitely includes a biscuit, some cornbread and a side of anything (Federal doesnt serve collards, yams, biscuits- just chicken and donuts).  So overall, I recommend you try it. It'll make you appreciate some West Philly joints a lot better. Try Roost in University City- now that is some nice friend chicken- and it comes with a biscuit."

I did not arrive there until 2pm in the afternoon, which led to anticipation and anxiety.  Both of these emotions were from hoping they were open, not sold out of donuts or Fried Chicken, and hoping that the line would not be too long.   They were sold out of their Fancy donuts, but they had plenty of their Hot Fresh donuts, which come in three flavors: Appollonia, Indian Cinnamon, and Vanilla-Lavender.  I was super geeked that they still had chicken.   \n\nI ordered each flavor of the Hot Fresh donuts and I ordered a half of chicken, which consist of a breast split in half, one drumstick, and one thigh.  You have the option of putting a dry rub or a wet rub on your chicken.  Torn between the dry rub and the wet rub, I went with my first inclination and ordered the harrissa dry rub. \n\nOn the surface, chicken and donuts seem like an odd combination, but they pair together well, just like chicken and waffles.   The fried chicken is Korean-style, which made it super crunchy, and the donuts were warm and delicious.  I can see why this place is so popular.  They serve up donuts and chicken that is different from the norm."

A forty-block drive and some sweaty palms later, we managed to score a few boxes of chicken, bags of donuts, and several smiles from the counter staff.

An hour later, work productivity went completely down the toilet.  Blame it on the amazingly crispy skin, the tenderness of the chicken, or the honey-glazed donut and Japanese pickles that accompany the lunch.  The za'atar chicken sent us out of work mode and into a serious food coma for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the donuts.

I'm not good in crowds so I tried to time my arrival accordingly(around 10:30am). SUBURBAN COMMUTER NOTE: I parked on the far side of Washington, thinking there would be no space available, but upon my trek over, noticed ample spots, just a block away.\n\nUpon my arrival, there was already a small group present. Those last vestiges of the morning rush combined with the early chicken go getters and I , in my arrogance, considered myself an equal member of both camps. I immediately took in the familiar and inviting faces of Blake and Felicia. They were busy but I couldn't help but think that they considered this their \" down time\". \n\nHere's the part of every one of my reviews, where I make an ass of myself. I was invited to take a seat at the counter. When I got there, there was counter space but no seat. I stood (happily) and watched the goings on. After a few minutes, Felicia came out to gently explain to me that the stools pull out and she\" pulled out my stool \" (sorry). You'd think someone who grew up with transformers would have figured it out, but ill blame the fact that I had been up since 4am.\n\nOnce properly seated, I was able to enjoy the best coffee and donuts the city (world) has to offer. I advise anyone to skip their usual cream and sugar and experience the flavor of that coffee raw. really good stuff. Granted, I was a little late to get the donuts fresh from the fryer, but damn, were they still the best I'd had and as a baker, Ive eaten cake donuts right out of the fryer before.\n\nI may have missed the hot donuts but my arrival meant I was one of the first to get a golden ticket for chicken. I was also lucky enough to have an eating companion there, who offered a mix and match scenario with the chicken so I was able to try both the Chili Garlic and the other (whose name I forget but it was the dry rub one). Both rocked my world and were just as good leftover later that night.\n\nIn my time at FD, I witnessed a staff that was  amazing. Blake was a fountain of donutcoffeechicken information, Felicia was the perfect \"face\" of the Front of the house and the BOH staff were a grim lesson in startling efficiency and ingenuity. The magic that they work in that small space was impressive. Unfortunately, there was a computer malfunction, that threatened to bring down the store's mojo. Skynet is truly taking over. Yet I watched these heroes, power through the hurdle like pros as the patient masses accepted the situation with quiet reverence, knowing that they have a good thing going here and to complain would kill it.\n\nI will cop to being a personal friend to a few of the staff here, but that should take nothing away from my great experience. There's a simplicity to Federal Donuts that will keep this endeavor afloat for as long as it wants to be. I propose to all national sports coverage, that henceforth, you can quit the cloying shots of louts making cheesesteaks in your cutaway shots and get a camera in FD, to show the real working class spirit of Philadelphia and foods that are actually appetizing.

The creativity and presentation of these donuts are amazing. I liked the grapefruit donut in the way it looked and  tasted it Citrus-y and sweet and not as tart as you would imagine a grapefruit would have been. Many donuts to choose from and different glazes but the grapefruit one stood out the most to me which is why I remember it so vividly.\n\nWent to this place last year in July as it was on Carrie's bookmarks.I doubt it was the fried chicken with many different flavors to choose from was the reason for our visit. Besides the GPS directions being called out, all we get is Federal Donuts. Who knew anything about fried chicken besides the locals who come here all the time. There's only four seats so take your food outside. There's a long red bench to share but you don't have to share your donuts. Forget about trying to find parking. You can always park in front of the fire hydrant like this lady did. She walked in like a boss, ordered, waited, grabbed her order, walked out, hopped in her car and left. Just make sure you carpool, one hops out and one waits in the car or circle the blocks. Just share your chicken so you can have more donuts. \n\nHappy National Donuts Day!! #NationalDonutsDay"

I've always heard about how great this place is, and it was not a disappointment. The donuts came out hot, which made them even more enjoyable. Overall the donut was good, but it could have been better with less sugar and more strawberry lavender flavor. The chicken was delicious. The skin was crispy and had just enough flavoring. It was also cooked perfectly as well. One thing that did bother me was the amount of chicken feathers left on the chicken wings. \n\nThere is inside seating, although it is limited. The staff there is very nice and attentive. One thing to note is that there is no bathroom, only a sink to wash your hands!"

I love!\n\nI have worked at Dunkin before, so I have sampled a lot of donuts but I have never had a fresh hot one in my life. You can see the staff prepare them freshly in the back, fried in the machine and then roll them into lavender-vanilla sugar while they are still hot. Super yummy and reasonably priced. My only regret is that I don't live down the street or like waking up early.\n\nFancy donuts doesn't come warm. (duh!) And they are pricier but well worth it. My favorites are the french toast donut and the turkish coffee one. Basically if it sounds good to you, try it. I'm sure you won't regret it. I bought a few dozens for my office and everyone loves them. \n\nOne thing though: the fancy donuts might run out before the day ends, so make sure you get here early. the regular donuts may last until early afternoon."

Not only is it delicious but the aroma from the spices is so inviting. The Vanilla Lavender is automatic but not overpowering with the lavender. All other doughnuts now seem sub-par.\n  The discussion of best fried chicken brings up all kinds of arguments but hands down, their Za'atar fried chicken is, for me, the best.  The skin is super crispy and the flavor packs a punch. I think the skin almost shields the chicken from getting dry. The chicken is super juicy and moist.. I can't get enough. The plain honey doughnut that comes with the chicken is sweet but not overly so, and it compliments the crispy, juicy chicken. \nI now live on the West Coast and I really need them to start shipping."

I guess it gets the advantage of unique flavors, but the true sign of good donuts is when the basic plain ones taste outstanding, which does not happen here. But I guess this day in age, where the nearest donut competitor is Dunkin Donuts, anything seems great.

Both were delicious and heavy on the rub and flavoring. The meat was juicy, and I think they achieved what they intended. \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, though, this is Korean-style chicken, and I have to admit I prefer the traditional approach with the buttermilk flavor. The pickles weren't up my alley so much, which is not to say that they weren't good for those who like the sweet and strongly flavored. Though the plain honey donut was as good as you could hope.\n\nFor the flavored donuts, we tried the strawberry-rhubarb, pomegranate-Nutella, Appollonia, and Indian cinnamon (I think! They disappeared rather quickly.). All were good, though my favorite was the Appollonia--the perfect mix of sugar and spice (cocoa, spices, orange?). They were consistently moist and fresh, with a perfect cake-like texture and donut-level chewiness. Definitely wished that this place was closer for the morning donut pick-me-up!\n\nFour stars instead of five since the fancy donuts aren't cheap (for donuts--$2 each--which is not to say the quality's not worth it) and the Southern girl in me doesn't find fried chicken completely satisfactory without some kind of traditional side.

But here's what I've tried, categorized into the yum, the meh, and the oops:\nYUM (strong flavors, light, tasty): cookies and cream, sticky bun, blueberry, cinnamon, and vanilla lavender (there was an actual stick of lavender sticking out from one of the donuts lol cute)\nMEH (weak flavors, okay): banana, peanut butter chocolate (couldn't taste the pb at all)\nOOPS (interesting but it just didn't work): strawberry ginger, lucky peach\n\nAs for the actual place, it's small and there really isn't a lot of seating.

FD staff is bend-over-backwards kind though at busier times of day, they know how to get the job done.\n\nI've sampled too many Federal donuts, if there is such a thing as \"too many.\"  Favorite include hot donuts Apollonia and Vanilla-Lavendar and fancy donuts S'mores and Raspberry Vanilla.  Raspberry Vanilla made a brief appearance one sweet day, and I have, sadly, not seen it since..  The hot donuts have the texture of those delicious apple cider donuts you can buy in outdoor markets and on farms, but the taste of Federal's hot donuts is completely different, in a good way.  I wasn't a fan of the Caramel Banana fancy donut, finding its caramel way too sweet to constitute this donut as anything but a dessert.\n\nFor those concerned with peanut allergies, the hot donuts are peanut-free, but Federal cannot guarantee the fancy donuts have not come in contact with peanuts.\n\nThe chicken at Federal is to die for delicious - just the right amount of skin with a perfect crisp that sucks up all the flavor of its seasoning and just below, melt-in-your-mouth moist chicken.  This chicken is addictive; you've been warned.  Please also note that Federal is sometimes out of flavors of donuts and/or chicken.\n\nA half or whole order of chicken comes in one of a variety of dry and wet seasonings.  The Harissa (dry) and Chile Garlic (wet) are two of my absolute favorites, and all chicken orders come with a complimentary lemon-y donut and Japanese pickles which I could eat by the bucketful.  Really.  The Buttermilk Ranch is  excessively salty, but if you're a lover of Ranch dressing, this may be for you.\n\nFederal Donuts also serves PT's coffee.

I was sad they didn't have any more wings by the time I went in (mind you I was there at 12:30!) so I guess they're a hot ticket item and we'll have to come back to try those out next time.  They served some kind of pickled condiment along with the chicken and I was not impressed. They tasted old and were soft instead of crunchy.  I like pickled veggies, especially with something heavy like fried chicken so I applaud the thought but their execution at least of the ones i got just missed.

I'm a big fattycakes and I'm down with whatever food that will proportionally kick my lifespan down a few notches for how good it sounds. That, and an admiration of the most spectacular Felicia whose smile is known to make hearts skip beats. We also can't forget Mike Solo, one of the best chefs that our city has to offer (Zahav is still one of my favorite restaurants), and the Bodhi Coffee folks.\n\nDespite my bias, being a fan of all the respective robot cats that form this sensational restaurant Voltron I can objectively admit that this place blows my mind. I admire the creativity in each one of their products. I will stand by every item I've taken a bite out of. I will even defend the sometimes absurd wait times or unavailability of products at unexpectedly early hours.\n\nIt's that good.\n\nThe donuts are dense, delicious. I've only had the pomegranate nutella tehina, key lime and indian cinnamon, all of which rocked. The pomnutehina is perhaps my favorite, followed closely by by the indian cinnamon.\n\nLast weekend my girlfriend and I arrived at 11:20-something in order to get a ticket to buy fried chicken at 11:45. We didn't actually walk out of there until 12:00 or so. That's at least a 40min wait for some fried chicken. Worth it? Hell yeah it was. They even came with some plain honey donuts, which were dense and delicious as the others.\n\nWe had the harissa and chile-garlic fried chicken. Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had? Yes. Perhaps the best in the city? Could be.\n\nAnyhow, lucky for me (unlucky for my waistband) I live within walking distance. I'm a fan, to say the least."

The ordering process was easy & went smoothly once we got the hang of it. Two of us split a half chicken with chili-garlic glaze.  The chicken was juicy and tender and the seasoning was tasty.  Note: the glazed is VERY messy.  We were lucky enough to grab seats at the counter. Wet naps would have been helpful. The chicken comes with a honey donut (good but nothing special) and Japanese pickles.  We also split an Indian Cinnamon hot donut and then immediately each ordered another one to eat.  The donuts are so warm and fragrant and taste as good as they smell. \n\nI'm still on a chicken & donuts high hours later.  I'll be back to sample the different chicken & donut varieties."

        "text": "I've absolutely had it with this place. I live right around the corner from Federal Donuts and while their products are A+, 100%, top shelf donuts - chicken - coffee, THE SERVICE IS AWFUL!!!!! It's like if Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast decided to make donuts and wanted to treat customers even more like schmucks than they already do.but it's not that they're being jerks...it's that they are totally and utterly incompetent.  \n\nThey pack you into this sardine can they call a shop and sort you out by a numbers system which really means 30 people are stuffed into a 15 person room with hot coffee in their hands and bumping into one another. Not to mention the time you're waiting is always way too long. It's like a good 15 minutes of standing there waiting before ordering and then who knows how long after that. \n\nTHEY RUN OUT all the time. If anything they think it's awesome to \"SELL OUT\". How about not selling out...how about actually providing the products you sell? CRAZY RIGHT?!?!?  Not to mention the hours are total crap...so not only do they run out of food but they close early. They can't even keep the amount of food for the small amount of hours they're open. Figure out how much you sell and supply it.\n\n\"Can I get a chocolate covered banana donut?\"\n\"No, we ran out. Actually we only have  Oatmeal raisin and S'mores\"\n\"There's six types of donuts on the menu and you only have two? It's only 11:50am!!\"\n\nAnd forget about chicken. It's awesome, which is even more frustrating because you better be ready to schedule your entire morning around it. Everyone waits and waits and waits while trays upon trays of chicken sit behind the counter. They only have one line/cashier so they call a number for chicken then see if anyone just wants donuts....\nwhy not try two cashiers/lines?\nwhy not take orders over the phone so people can just pick it up?\nwhy not actually have enough product on site or another site to go to when you run out?\nwhy not treat people with respect and courtesy? \nMaybe these aren't the solutions but try SOMETHING!\n\nI was actually told that they ran out of \"fancy\" donuts...so I ordered a two hot ones and then a worker walks up to the cashier and told him to stop taking orders. STOP TAKING ORDERS? You're a donut shop with 20 people inside and you're not taking donut orders? I left and didn't go back for a good two months. I wanted to give it another go and AGAIN, they ran out of fancy donuts and the numbers for the chicken were in the high twenties with low numbers being called. So forget about chicken if you have anything else planned. It's never been so hard to get a business's product. \n\nFederal Donuts needs to pay less attention to they're sarcastic facebook posts and more on treating customers with respect. They're not rude locals slinging cheesesteaks with an attitude justified from years of dealing with obnoxious city folk, they're little hipster kids that should be grateful for the business. What happened to the days when businesses actually appreciated their customers?\n\nI gave them one star because no matter how good their food is, it's not even close to the effort that needs to be put in and I live around the corner.\n\nFederal Donuts....PLEASE STOP MAKING IT SO HARD TO BUY YOUR FOOD! Especially when your donuts are $2 a pop as it is."

But, I've had 2/3's of what Federal Donuts is known for so take it or leave it.\n\nThe coffee... top notch in my opinion if you're a black coffee drinker.  It's not harsh like some Starbucks brews but it's balanced, smooth, sensual, sexy, funny at times, likes long walks on the beach, into skinny dipping... the whole 9 yards.\n\nIf coffee isn't your fancy and donuts are, then you're in for a real treat.  The flavor combinations are wild but they all work together in harmony.  In the era of wild creations like Little Baby's Ice Cream and Pizza Brain, Federal Donuts holds a special spot in my heart because they're doing the same thing; crazy combinations that make you question your taste buds.  Point-in-case... I hate peanut butter and jelly.  My mom would make it for me every day as a kid and I'd toss it in the trash or feed it to the dog (Mom if you're reading this, that's not why Walter died).  However, Federal Donuts makes a spiced peanut butter and jelly donut... I can't explain it, but I love it... probably because it's fried.\n\nReally excited to try the chicken.  I hear amazing things but can never get down there at 11:30 during the week.  I'm not alive at 11:30 am on the weekends, so I need to figure something out."

I have had 8-10 of their types of donuts and I still have yet to find one better than the classic cinnamon sugar. At $1.5 a donut, or $6 for a half dozen, they are on the expensive end but you definitely get quality for what you spend. We also had the cookies & cream and the strawberry lavender, and they were both absolutely delicious, especially the strawberry. The fried chicken is also amazing. We had the spicy middle eastern rub and ordered a 3 piece. The 3 piece chicken and 1.5 donuts each were more than to fill us up for hours. \n\nStaff is always great and willing to answer any questions. Line is never super long even at peak times, and it is always a health mix of locals and tourists checking it out."

The coffee and mandarin really went well together. If I had to have one right now with a coffee, this would be my go to.\n\nI think the place really does live up to expectations mainly because of the uniqueness of the different flavors. Some of the flavors, I ask myself \"really\"? but then they end up being fantastic.  Although it's not a place I will go to every weekend (pricey), I will definitely keep up with the new flavors and maybe dabble more into the chicken (the honey ginger was really good). Keep it interesting FedNuts!"

        "text": "Donuts and fried chicken. This is one of my favorites places ever.\n\nNot only do they serve two of the finest foods known to man, but they happen to be so incredibly good, and the service is also outstanding.\n\nMy only problem here is that they sell out of everything too quickly. Make sure you get here earlier in the day to avoid disappointment (or don't, so that I won't be disappointed).\n\nThis time I was here, by about 1:30, they only had 2 out of 6 of their Fancy Donut flavors left. This was actually a good thing though, as I probably never would have ordered these flavors, and they were both excellent. We tried the Blackberry Anise and the Mango Coconut. At $2 each, these are an absolute steal.\n\nEven cheaper, and just as delicious, are the Fresh Donuts, which are available in 3 different rotating flavors. These are only $1.25 each, and they fry them fresh on the spot for you, so you get them piping hot. There are few foods better than a fresh, hot donut, so you must make sure to try at least one of these. We tried the Vanilla Lavender on this visit, and it was really great.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, they also make some outstanding fried chicken. You can get a half chicken ($9) or a whole chicken ($17), which consists of breasts, thighs and drumsticks, or you can get wings ($9 for half a dozen). You can also choose from a ton of rotating dry or glazed preparations as well, which have all been great so far in my few visits. I've tried the Buttermilk Ranch and Za'atar here, both dry toppings, and both great. Like everything else, it all tasted so fresh. The chicken was incredibly juicy and tasty.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, they also give you a free, simple Honey Glazed donut with every order of fried chicken.\n\nThe service here is great. Every single worker is super friendly and is very helpful with suggestions. They are very talkative and frequently chat with customers, as the few seats in the small place are lined up at the counter.\n\nI've been to more than my fair share of this new thing of Fried Chicken & Donut restaurants, and this one is by far the best. I  will keep on returning also because of the great variety. I came a year ago, and the entire selection of donuts was completely different. Any time I'm in Philly now, this is a must."

I haven't had chicken like that in years. It reminds me of the south actually. The reason why I gave it four stars is because I thought it was a little too salty, but otherwise it is pretty amazing chicken. \n\nThe donuts were okay, but I didn't go there for donuts, I went there for the chicken and I was pleased.

Maybe I took my prior to visiting description a little too far... These are hands down the best donuts that I've had to date... I was looking forward to being disappointed that I waited til I got home to try them. I didn't want anyone to hear me cursing about wasting my $2 per donut money on just flour, yeast, and some watered down sugar icing.... Anyway, my favorite was the caramel banana. I don't think that I've ever taken the time before to identify every ingredient that I tasted in a donut. This was one awesome donut. Soft and pillow-like. The only thing missing was the banana peel and the caramel wrapper. I guess my favorite Amish fried donuts have been kicked down to #2..."

I will share with you one thing I've had to come to terms with - do not walk into this place mid to late morning dreaming of a particular fancy donut. \n\nThe hot made-to-order donuts are always there...waiting, but there are only a limited amount of fancy donuts available each day - the diminishing availability making the fancies that much more appealing.\n\nInevitably, the person in line in front of you will get the last [insert the name of your favorite donut here] and you will feel an immediate intense hatred for that person as you glare heatedly at the back of their head - willing the person to change their mind at the last minute. \n\nThat person leaves with your donut - no doubt feeling the prickle of your glare boring into them as they exit. You realize you are holding up the line with your glare and hastily glance up at the board at the remaining donut choices. You're so thrown off that you choose whatever one your eyes register first - not even thinking. Barely registering which (non-favorite) fancy donut is now resting in the bag in your hand. \n\nYou pout - still thinking about your favorite donut - the crumbs of which that person in front of you in line is now licking off their fingers somewhere close by. You find a seat, open the bag and pull out the donut, frowning slightly, and take a bite.  \n\nAnd it's beyond delicious. Your new favorite. \n\n[Repeat]"

The hardest part was deciding which donuts and which flavor of fried chicken. Ended up ordering 2 donuts (Appolonia, Vanilla-Lavender), but the girl behind the counter was so sweet and she gave us a free Indian Cinnamon - pretty awesome. As for the chicken we opted for half the chicken (since they were out of wings) with the dry seasoning of Za'atar. \n\nWe (boyfriend and friend) had the donuts right away. It was insanely fresh. I actually didn't expect this from donuts but it was so pillow-y soft, actually it tasted like cake. Warm, moist and soft donuts. The best out of the 3 donuts was the cinnamon one.\n\nA good few hours past and we were able to dig into the chicken. It got cold. The dry seasoning started to taste heavy. The combination of flavor was kind of weird, it's like a cross of old bay seasoning and some citrus flavor - oh and the chicken pieces were small. Even though this was a bit of a disappointment, we saw another donut laying there! Apparently the chicken came with a honey donut, and this donut won me over. It was simple and plain but the sweetness of the honey stood out from the donut. I can eat a whole box of this.\n\nFederal Donuts is a must stop if you're in Philly. They just don't make anything like this in NYC."

The dry rub lends impeccable flavor to a crisp, salty crust. The chicken was exceptionally cooked, moist, and greasy in a good way. \n\nMy boyfriend's order of glazed chili garlic was reminiscent of Korean fried chicken, ala Cafe Soho. A crisp outer shell, anointed with hot/sweet glaze with visible chili flakes and a less-heavy feel than some similar Korean-fried styles. But I still preferred the dry rub.\n\nWe arrived around 11:20 a.m. on Saturday, waited patiently with other customers milling about, made chit chat with neighbors and other poultry-hungry strangers.

Some like it hot, and also for the paper bag that carried the donuts home to be translucent leaning transparent as it sucked up some fry oil.  That isn't to say they're oily or greasy.

Service was friendly. \n\nThey only serve 80 chickens a day starting at noon. Suposedly their limiting factor is how many chickens they can brine overnight, but this problem could be served by just getting kosher chicken, which is already brined. I suspect that they have just realized that the fake scarcity increases the value of the product. \n\nNow, the food.\n\nDonuts:  If you like cake donuts, the simple $1.25 ones are better than most, especially when hot. However, they lack the snappy texture of a truly great cake donut and the fancy $2 donuts compound thje problem with heavy glazes and fillings. The coffee was first rate\n\nChicken: First of all, this chicken is actually overbrined. A bonus of overbrining your chicken is that you can cook it fall-off-the-bone tender without drying it out. The downside is that it can begin to take on the texture of lunchmeat. This was right on the edge. Being Korean style, this chicken is not breaded with a secret blend of 11 herbs and spices. It's more like Buffalo wings which at most might be dusted with flour. Cooked fresh to order in hot oil, there is not a hint of grease clinging to the bird. \n\nI had mine tossed with Za'atar seasoning blend, which could have used some salt. And something about the dry spices just tasted like...dry spices. It didn't meld. I suspect the glazes work better.\n\nBottom Line: I've had better Korean fried chicken and I prefer American fried chicken anyway. However, this  chicken is unique in Philly and they do a good job with it. I might go back to try the glaze."

Other than the Pina Colada and Pistachio-Halvah (the fancier $2 ones) I couldn't taste a substantial difference between the other 3. To read the reviews here, I expected more than what I got. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I just don't see what all the hype is about. It's just a friggin donut! I could go to any good bakery and find better.

You also get a side of these interesting pickle-like veggies, which I really liked because I'm a sucker for pickled anything. Also I really liked their coffee and this is someone who is usually very sensitive to coffee. A few side notes:\n\n-You really need to get there early (11:15am-ish) to get your chicken by a decent time. If you get here too late, forget about the wait time, be concerned if there are any chicken left. Which leads me to the second point...\n-This place knows what its doing since they set a specific amount of donuts and chicken to make a day. Instead of pumping out items all day long, they have a set limit and when they run out, they run out. \n\nSo the question is, do you need them more than they need you?

Temperature is not an issue, as I love getting a still warm red velvet doughnut at Peter Pan on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint (which is actually way cheaper), it is flavor.

I waited anxiously until the hype died down but I couldn't wait to taste the chicken and donuts that would forever ruin my diet. Hey, if you're going to cheat, go all out!  I arrived on a wet and cold Tuesday morning at 11:00 a.m. It should be noted that I huffed it on my bike because I wanted to make sure I was in line to taste some of that delicious chicken. When I walked in, the first words out of my mouth was hi.. Chicken! Wait, sorry.. that was really direct. \"Are you serving chicken yet?\" No, we don't serve until 11:45 a.m. but you're welcome to try some of our chicken wings. Yes!!! They served them up with a ginger glaze and a few seconds later, I don't remember if they were even bones left. As I swayed from side to side waiting for the chicken, I was soon joined by a crowd of people who kept popping in and out to wait for the clock to hit 45 and I was first in line.. Yay me! The chicken comes in halves and I took the recommendation of fellow yelper Mikey I and got the Harissa flavored chicken and pomegranate donut. My sweaty palms wanted to tear up my box but it was too crowded to enjoy this fine delicacy. After arriving in a safe and quiet location (aka. my apartment) I tore into the fried chicken. Wow. What a party of flavors. Crunchy and juicy. I know those 2 words don't often go together but they certainly found a happy marriage here. Although I'm not much for sweets, the flavors of the pomegranate tickled my tongue and had me yearning for more. But alas, I was without any \"Federal goodness.\" I have no shame in admitting that if the donuts and chicken were served on a plate, I would go and lick it clean. \n\nThank you."

Yeah the hot donuts are good... but the speciality donuts is what will make your brain happy. Just do yourself a favor-- get one of each and grab two friends, split the donuts in thirds and have a sampling party like we did. Call it education.\n\nPS. The chicken ain't no back-up quarterback-- i's running it's own team. Curry spiced fried chicken. Beautiful."

James Beard award winner Mike Solo and foodie/Yelper Felicia D, that's who. \n\nThough I haven't been able to try the fried chicken yet, this opening morning's coffee and donuts were exceptional. With 10 varieties of \"fresh\" or \"fancy\" donuts, you'll have to choose wisely. Fresh sugar glazed 'nuts are fried to order in flavors like chili-lime and Indian cinnamon. \n\nI chose the fancy nutella tehina donut, topped with pomegranate glaze and sesame seeds. One of the most interesting combinations of flavors I've had: there's barely a hint of nutella, as the fruity pom juice dominates, followed by the slightly nutty taste of sesame paste.\n\nFederal Donuts (or FedNuts, as the kids are calling it) is a corner spot on S. 2nd street, just past the Mummers museum. The bright blue awnings will draw you into this cozy space, with its sunny wooden counters and swirly glass coffee contraptions (which look to me like props from a scientist's lair, but it makes a damn good brew). \n\nThere isn't much space to hang out inside, but service is friendly and quick, manned this morning by the lovely Felicia D herself. Would love to see a cafe table or two in the spring, and a more mobile/user-friendly website once things get rolling.\n\n\nEDIT: Finally got a chance to try all the donut varieties, since my boss brought in a dozen this morning. The Indian Cinnamon is by far the best of the bunch, with a warm, spiced flavor. What is that extra spice? Cardamom? Delicious. Many of the filled cake varieties err on cloying at times, but I'm a sugar/dessert lover. The key lime, with graham cracker crumb toppings, is my favorite \"fancy flavor\" after the Pomegranate Tehina. If you're not a big sweets person, stick to the fresh-fried and maybe ask them to dust with less sugar...just not when there's a line."

I've never seen such a concentration of loud, rude, angry, foul-smelling, poorly-dressed shit-eaters in my entire life.  \n\nWhen you've lived here long enough, you actually stop noticing it  - even BECOMING it - until you visit another city, and everyone there seems as if they're 3/5ths into a serious narcotic high: friendly, happy, talkative, relaxed.  When you visit that other city, people might say \"HI!\" to you on the street or at a bar, and it makes you feel suspicious - but then you realize: you've become a Philadelphia asshole.\n\nI was recently browsing WIKIPEDIA.COM and learned that the French invented the term \"d\u00e9class\u00e9\" when they first visited the original settlement of Philadelphia in 1524.  I learned that we put the \"phil\" in \"philistine\".  Worse yet, I learned that many years ago corruption was almost eradicated from the collective human consciousness, but we Philadelphians kept it alive during this time much like the Arabs kept the Greek classics alive during the Middle Ages.  \n\nThis shittyness all seems to fade away when you visit Federal Donuts.  It's like walking into an alternate reality where Good Things actually happen in Philadelphia, and everyone is super elated about it.  For that brief moment when you first bite into a hot Indian cinnamon donut, we actually live in a first-rate city, with first-rate sports teams, first-rate city planning, and first-rate career opportunities.  For a split second, everyone is suddenly very attractive and has an interesting and articulate worldview.   You even think that, at long last, you might not run the risk of getting your ass kicked or your throat slashed if you walk home alone in the middle of the night. \n\nEvery customer of Federal Donuts is happy beyond reason.   Adorable, rosy-cheeked citizens cup steaming envelopes of hot donuts in their hands and hold them to their noses, smiling like they just won the lottery.   At lunchtime as the line winds out the door for fried chicken, truck drivers hold hands with be-mohawked feminists who hold hands with Mummers who hold hands with hipsters who hold hands with the guys who used to beat them up in highschool - and they sing.\n\nEveryone knows that the donuts and fried chicken are fucking delicious, but I give Federal Donuts five stars and tons of credit purely for the fact that they've created an oasis of joy and civility in this otherwise bleak tundra of disappointment, violence, and despair."

Federal Donut chicken was fried to a nice crisp. The sauce wasn't too spicy. Every component of the sandwich really stood out. Chick Fil A has some competition. The price point was a bit steep.

So, if you don't have a car and aren't running or biking to South Philly (about 1 mile south of south street),don't bother going or go to their other location.  BUT, if you have a car and have a 2nd person to sit in the car while you go into to pick up your order... you're golden.  Parking's lousy in the area so you need the 2nd person to sit in your car while you double park at the hydrant next door.\n\nThe chicken is pieces like split breasts, thighs or legs (wings are a separate item).  The chicken either comes plain or with one of two dry rubs, or one or two \"glazes\" which are wet sauces put on.  We tried one dry rub and tried one glaze; both were terrific.\n\nDonuts come plain, simple, or fancy (Simple is $1.25, fancy are $2.00 each).  Simple are basically flavored sugared- I had Vanilla Jasmine) and fancy are fancy iced ($2.00 each- we had one oreo, toffee, pB chocolate, and others).  \n\nThe simple are simply sugared donuts which are terrific... They come served hot, and are probably a better deal than the fancy, which are also terrific, although not served warm. Take 'em home and nuke 'em for 15 minutes.  If you like iced donuts than the fancy ones are for you.\n\nIf you are leaving town and need a breakfast fix (really good anytime) or want chicken to go...then definitely stop by.\n\nYou can eat at this sparsely decorated, tiny restaurant, but I would recommend it for takeout.  Since the place is so small, the people waiting to take food ended up standing over the shoulder of the few diners.\n\nStaff was very helpful with the options.  Really loved it here.

Both will fill you up.\n\nJudging on Federal Donuts' popularity, I mistakenly thought that service would be pretentious, but the one girl holding down the fort at the counter was helpful in explaining the menu, patient when we were indecisive (although, let's admit, we just got all the flavors), and made us chuckle by calling out our order with \"Team Ryan!!\".\n\n5 stars for creativity and good execution and being unpretentious at the same time."

I'm so glad they're open for dinner on the weekends now!! It wasn't crowded and the wait was minimal. The chicken came with yummy Japanese pickles and a donut, plus I got a fancy donut so that I can give them my entire $20 (it only seemed fair!). This place is worth all the raving about. Can't wait to try more rubs!\n\nSpecial Note: They've added a few more stools, so I'd say 6 seats altogether? Not bad! I bet they open up for dinner during the week if business takes off!"

I know cake doughnuts are a whole different ball-game from yeast doughnuts but...I did expect a little more. This is strictly on the doughnuts, I didn't get any chicken so another review could lift it to five.\n\nAll the wishy-wash aside, I am so happy I made it to Federal Donuts this morning. I ordered the Indian Cinnamon and the Orange-glazed Pistachio and found both to be just perfect. Not too sweet or fattening, just right. I am thankful that it is only a three minute bike ride down Washington Avenue from my spot in the Italian Market.\n\nI really like the space that they found as it is in the middle of a very residential neighborhood, and who knows what could follow Federal Donuts as the next establishment in the steadily gentrifying section of South Philly (Pennsport). I also loved that Aloe Blacc was playing in the background, nice touch guys.\n\nFor those who want to take a walk around, definitely stop by Grindcore House on 4th & Dickinson, not too far away from Federal Donuts for vegan fare and great coffee as well. There are two parks in walking distance: Jefferson and Dickinson Squares, respectively.\n\nCan't wait to try the house blend (amazing that they have one already!) or the cold brewed coffee, and of course the fried chicken! I am coming back next week and hopefully they will have some chicken left around dinner time next Tuesday. Dr. Brown's too? Gotta give them props for catering to the Jewish deli lovers too.\n\nLast note: for those biking, be aware that there is NO PLACE to lock your bike up in the immediate vicinity, so we just had to leave them unlocked in plain sight. Something to keep in mind...!"

I look forward to more fancy donuts.  I just want them to bring back the delightful Lemon Meringue, but I guess not all good things can last forever.\n\nTheir chicken is a whole other animal, duh.  The sandwich is a classic.  I'm frequently tempted to snag one before work.  It's portable, hot and packed with flavor.

I (accidentally) opted for two premade ones: a peanut butter malt and a pastelito (guava and cream cheese) one. The pastelito was a little too sour for me, although it did a nice job of cutting through the sweetness. The peanut butter malt one was simultaneously rich and tender and I adored it.

Earlier this summer, I opted for one each of the fancy donuts which included: cookies & cream, blueberry muffin, sticky bun, chocolate peanut butter, banana cream pie, and white chocolate peach.  My tastebuds were in heaven with every bite of each donut.  The banana cream pie donut may actually be the best donut I have ever had.  \n\nWith the high bar the delectable donuts set, I was amazed at how the chicken was just as good.  I've tried the buttermilk ranch and chili-garlic chicken thus far and both were the best chicken I have ever had.  If I could only pick one, I would go with the chili-garlic because of the spicy kick of the glaze.  Overall, Federal Donuts would be the one culinary spot in Philadelphia I would recommend all visitors go to."

Sometimes, after a night shift, I will drive out of the way for the Vanilla-Lavender. That and the Indian Cinnamon are my favorite. Nothing beats a warm, soft, aromatic treat. The fancy flavors don't rate as high on my list because I'm a fan of keeping it simple and flavors like Pina Colada are usually more than my tastebuds want to handle early in the morning. \n\nThe service is remarkably cheery and snappy even at 8am on a Saturday morning which is when you had better get there lest you want to miss out. Doughnuts are continually cranked in perfect form right behind the counter. It's rather mesmerizing. The coffee is good and strong but I do wish they had tea and hot chocolate as well. \n\nPerhaps someday I will try the chicken, but to tell the truth - I hate meat on bones."

I couldn't make up my mind about what ones to get so I decided to get one of each donut and try them all! I didn't like the \"hot\" donuts. I thought they all tasted the same, and i couldn't tell which was which. The fancies on the other hand were sooooooo good! I didn't care for the Raspberry balsamic at 1st but as I kept eating it the taste grew on me. I think the best one out of all the fancies was the Pina Colada. It was like I just bit into a piece of pineapple (it was full of flavor!) I also got a small coffee (they sell large too) and it was one of the best coffee that I ever had! I was kicking my self because I got a small and I wasn't sure I was going to like it (should of got a large) The one (and when I say 1 I really do mean it ) complaint is (and why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars) is the floor in the main are was SO sticky that my feet were kind of sticking to the floor.

The online buzz surrounding the grand opening resulted in a depletion of donuts by 9am and chickens by 12:15pm.  However, I had more luck the last three times I have visited.\n\nThe donuts are all great, especially the fresh, hot options (my wife says the Vanilla Lavender is the best...hard to argue).  But the chickens are, soundly, the best I have ever eaten.  The chile-garlic glazed was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy and perfectly tender.  Its reign as the best chicken I had ever tasted lasted for about four minutes, when I tasted the Harissa.  Slightly smokey with just the right amount of spice, and the crispiest skin!  Perfection!\n\nFringe benefit: when you order a chicken, they serve it broken down in to parts so you do not have to tear at it like a savage."

Federal rotates their flavors on a daily basis. Their doughnuts are all cooked fresh and come out hot and delicious. Our favorite of the 3 was the  Indian Cinnamon. They were out of the fancy doughnuts, it was almost 3:00 PM. I would like to go back and try the fried chicken.

Great donuts. My wife and I had the: key lime, chocolate raspberry, pomegranate nutella, all fancy. All of the fancy have one of the flavors laced in the middle of the donut. Very good but the fancy are cold. If hot they would be heavenly. The one hot one we had was the Indian cinnamon which was fantastic. Must say best donuts we've ever had. Coffee was ok, best to grab a Starbucks on the way. Can't wait to try the fried chicken! Three negatives: they sell out of donuts early, the fried chicken goes even quicker and lastly, Federal is located in a neighborhood with absolutely no parking. I made the mistake of turning on the side street where they're located, nothing all the way down which results in about a 6+ block circle back and still ended up parking 2 blocks away.

The coffee was rich and flavorful.  A great start to my Saturday! Highly recommended.\n\nI'm saving the fifth star for when I get to try the chicken next time I'm in the neighborhood.

The fancy donuts will sell out, so if you go in craving one - go in early so you will not get disappointed! \n\nThe fried chicken, oh the fried chicken. It is so gd good. Unreal good. The za'tar and the chili garlic are my go-to flavors (usually a half of each to split with someone). Also, you get a free hot donut (just regular ol' cake style) with your chicken! And free japanese pickles! SO MUCH FREE STUFF HOW CAN THIS NOT BE GOOD? \n\nLastly, the coffee at Federal Donuts is some of the best coffee I have had in the city - extra bold, nutty and delicious! It also makes a great gift for people - just make sure to get it ground if the person you are buying the gift for does not have a coffee grinder!\n\nI took one star off because sometimes the person working the front register is rude, it is usually just the one staff member, but it upsets me that Federal Donuts continues to employ such a sour puss."

I've had much better from other independent donut shops throughout the U.S.\n\nBut what really struck me was that the \"interesting\" flavors of donuts were not that interesting...the flavoring struck me as mild, dominated by the overall donut flavor.  Contrast this with the now closed Burnside donuts of Lancaster, PA, which featured things that actually tasted unique and interesting, such as a maple-iced cinnamon swirl bun, that definitively tasted maple-y and cinnamon-y.\n\nLike many others, I think this place has been over-hyped.

It wasn't the flavoring or anything, I felt like they just used low quality chicken but who knows, maybe it was an off day or something or maybe that piece just had a lot of dark meat which I don't like.

I ended up ordering half a dozen for some co-workers, and wished I ordered another half a dozen more for myself haha! Each doughnut can definitely feed two (though why would you want to share?!), and taste definitely matches the size. \n\nThis place also has a small lunch/chicken menu (explaining their logo) but I didn't really go in for that so not sure how they deliver on that front. \n\nThere are a few spots peppered throughout the city of this brand and they do have an online presence with pre ordering options (for quantities for a dozen or more) which is always a plus!

Crispy and juicy and incredibly flavorful, covered in a flavor-punch of ranch powder... incredible.\n\nChili Garlic:  Absolutely delicious.

I decided to go for three different flavors, since I heard rave reviews for the chili-garlic got a whole chicken with that and then i got a half coconut curry and half of  harissa.  \n\nThe trek back home was brutal because I just wanted to dig in and eat it on spot but I had my family waiting for me.  Out of the three I got I would say that the coconut curry flavor was the best.  The harissa kinda reminded me of the old bay seasoning and the chili-garlic reminded me of the chicken i get at the korean grocery store.  I think if I had eaten the chili-garlic on spot it would have been better but since I had to drive home the batter got soggy and was not crispy.  The dry ones were very crispy.  I also think next time I will get the wings.  The piece are kinda too big and you can't really enjoy the batter, plus I thought it was kinda dry.  They also give you a honey donut with the chicken which is a very nice compliment. I enjoyed it and the donut was very tasty.\n\nOverall my experience was nice but I guess I was expecting more because of the hype. I would much other go to soho and enjoy their chicken which is a tad bit better."

I am one of them.\n\nI've been dying to try this place since it opened its doors. When I was recovering after surgery all social media was a buzz with FedNuts. All I wanted was a donut, I would have settled for just one little morsel, but I knew I had to wait until I was better. Yesterday I finally got the chance to indulge! Normally places don't live up to the hype, but FedNuts has surpassed all of the hype! It is one righteous establishment! \n\nQuick Summery of the deliciousness I've tried:\nHot\nThe Appollonia was the first donut I tried from FedNuts and I made sure to savor every bite. Warm and delicious you can't go wrong.\n\nFancies\nPina Colada- it's oh so tropical, it made me feel like I was on vacation\nCaramel-Banana ,Love this combo, simple yet delicious\nPassionfruit Poppy Very unique and I just had a passionfruit last week, and the taste is spot on.  This may be my favorite. Shh don't tell the others.\nChocolate-Spicy Peanut, amazing, I want this to be offered as a bar snack at every bar in the city! Spicy, salty, peanuts and chocolate, but a donut at the same time? Someone figured out the key to my heart...\n\nI love them all so much, I'm so happy I don't live in South Philly because I'd be eating there way too often!"

        "text": "So much hype...\n\n...and so much success! Federal Donuts is an experience. Philly and Twitter are on fire with it and as I discovered this morning, with good reason. The line out the door at 7. The cashier so friendly and seamlessly processing multiple orders demanding infinite combinations of coffee and donuts before sunrise on a Saturday. The counters made of recycled surfboards. Beneath them, fold-out stools cleverly tucked away. I've seen complaints of limited seating. It is, but not as bad as its been made out to be. There are seven to ten fold-out stools and a very spartan concrete bench in the window.\n\nThe donuts are great but lets start with what's epic: the coffee! Wow! It has this unforgettable sweet delicious flavor. I decided against interfering with it by adding milk or sugar. \n\nAs for the donuts, let's start with the fresh:\n\nThey take a little while. I didn't mind as I sipped my coffee and enjoyed watching people mixing real donut batter, a sight far too rare in America circa 2011. I started with a vanilla-lavender. Great combination of sweet flavors. The Appollonia and Indian Cinamon are OK but I would rather just have a plain donut out of the fryer. I will probably ask for one next time. Perhaps this will be the start of the Federal Donuts secret menu. \n\nAs for the fancy:\n\nThey are stacked in racks behind the counter just like cupcakes at Magnolia Bakery in New York. If you are in a hurry, I would just order them as they are ready to go. The best of the bunch is the honey almond. Its just a bit wet and has perfect sweetness and taste. The key lime is another top notch winner. The filling is great and the graham cracker crumbs on top are the perfect finish. The nutella-tehina-pomegranate was my third favorite. Just like with the key lime, the filling is great. The orange blossom pistachio is good and I would probably kvell over it, but it is hard to impress after bites of the others. When I tasted the coconut pineapple, I wished they stuck to just coconut. The most meh of the bunch was the chocolate raspberry. It looks beautiful but I was hoping for a chocolate cake instead of a chocolate coating. I'm sure its multiple times better than a Dunkin Donut but it was a low point at Federal Donuts. \n\nOne day I will try the chicken. For now I hope they open at 5:30 so I can get some and still be at work but 7:30. Opening a second location on Easton Road in Glenside would also be appreciated."

And being a smart ass when a customer does review is especially intuitive of your whole operation. Opening a restaurant is a risk because you have to cater to the public...you've instead taken the risk out by trying to have the public cater to you. Which annoys people. You don't have to have run a successful donut shop or be Fred the Baker to figure that out.\n\nAnd I called you hipsters (or at least the ones I saw, hipsters) because you fit the definition.

We woke up early one Saturday and upon arrival there were several people in their small shop waiting for donuts. Luckily we got there around 8am and they still had all their flavors available. We got a half dozen assortment of cookies and creme, chocolate sea salt, vanilla lavender, indian spice, cranberry, and some other one. The donuts themselves were like $1.75 each for hot and $2 something for cold. Crazy expensive. They were put in bags instead of a box and the two women at the counter seemed too busy talking amongst themselves then being friendly to their customers. My husband also got coffee and was semi disappointed. His comment was it \"was good and hot\" but considering it was 8am on a November morning, that's not saying much. The donuts were absolutely nothing to write home about. I don't understand the hype at all. Maybe we should have tried the chicken, but after trying 2 out of the 3 things they do with no satisfaction, it wasn't worth the risk. I mean seriously, they only do 3 things: donuts, coffee and chicken... get it right.\nIf you want some seriously AMAZING donuts, head over to Beilers at Reading Terminal Market. Donuts are .90Cents each and there are about 40 different varieties."

Skip the \"fancy\" donuts because they're soggy and way too sweet. The fresh donuts from the other side of the menu are better and cheaper. Maybe they'll iron things out after they're open a little longer, but I doubt I'll bother going back to check. If you liked cupcakes or bacon-peanut butter cookies 2-3 years ago, you'll probably flip out over this place. Maybe I'm old school, but for my $$, I'd rather have 1/2 dozen sour cream donuts from Jack's in Laurel Springs. Or the cream-filled donuts at Frangelli's where they actually pump the cream into the donuts after you buy them.

Honestly, I prefer the former. I haven't tried any of the recent fancy flavors, but the last dozen I got months ago were kind of disappointing. None of them were all that special: just super sweet and kind of overpriced cake donuts.

And the donuts are cake based.  Coffee by PT's Roasters & a Strawberry Lavender Donut is a super respectable b'fast...but if you stopped here for a coffee & donut in the  morning you will be missing out on the chicken experience so it's best to go around 11 for lunch - you beat the crowd, it's not too late for coffee and you can grab lunch w/ a donut to go for that late afternoon boost that you may want.  The wings are the full 2 part jointed kind so 1/2 dozen is plenty for one person.  The Shabazzi dry rub style turned out to be my fave but the chili garlic  glaze was delicious as well - just messier.  You get some sliced pickles & a regular donut w/ 1/2 dozen wings and boy does that go well together....must be the sweet / savory thing kinda like chicken n waffles.

In the realm of fancy doughnut shops its a 3/5 but in the realm of doughnut shops as a whole it's a 2/5 when you factor in taste, price, wait, etc. \n\nI came here on a visit back home from Brooklyn. I've had my fair share of fancy doughnut places in NY like Dough and the Doughnut Plant but have never been really impressed so my expectations coming in weren't high. People usually over hype them and I finally taste them for myself with the \"meh\" reaction. \n\nFederal Donuts has a good variety, small store and friendly staff. The prices are hefty and I feel like I pay the same amount in hipster Brooklyn. Just take the free honey doughnut that comes with the chicken unless you're coming for just fancy doughnuts. The free one is hot, quality, light and fluffy. Great for $0.00! \n\nMy family and I got buttermilk ranch 4 piece chicken and honey ginger 4 piece chicken ($16...-__-) and Indian cinnamon, Apollonia, blueberry mascarpone, double chocolate, lemon poppyseed and an extra honey doughnut because I like honey. I wanted mixed chicken flavors but they have to do a whole batch of each flavor since it's made to order. So prepare to buy a lot of chicken at a premium if you're visiting town and can't just come back next week for a different flavor. \n\nThe chicken was a bit under cooked and had some of the feather tips still attached so it can be cooked and cleaned better. The flavors were fine. The honey ginger is way better and could be stronger but that's because I love ginger so I expected more kick.  \n\nI didn't really like the doughnut base for the blueberry and cinnamon. I liked the toppings but the actual doughnut tasted a bit burnt/wheat? Not sure but the actual dough flavor wasn't great to me. My friend and my mom liked it though so its a matter of personal preference. I liked all the toppings though and loved the lemon poppyseed and honey. \n\nThe pickles are awesome and I would buy just those. Zesty and flavorful and fresh. \n\nWould I come back? Maybe to try the harissa chicken or some super crazy doughnut combination but I wouldn't go out of my way. I would be happy with warm crispy creme and popeyes for cheaper."

The vanilla lavender donuts are scrumptious. I didn't realize just how much of a treat piping hot donuts are in comparison to donuts that have sat on a rack for god-knows-how-long at dunkin donuts.

It's sauced in a Korean-style Gotchujang-type paste, so if you're familiar with that, you'll be a fan of this.  Also, you're getting 6 wholes wings which is really 12 drums and flats.  And you get Asian style pickles.  And you get an awesome old-fashioned donut - not rolled in sugar!  All this for 9 bucks, which if you think about it, is not a bad deal at all.

On the dry one, the skin was nice and crisp, but it was way over-seasoned, and the meat was almost dry. On the wet one, the wet sauce had turned the crispy skin into unpalatable mush. It was also almost dry. The chicken itself was not flavorful, and not especially tender.\n\nThat's it, mediocre chicken, even if you were checking out Modest Mouse in tiny venues fifteen years ago, the chicken is still not that good. Get over yourself.\n\nNever trust a fried chicken place filled only with white people.\n\nYeah, but anyway, like I said, the donuts were fine."

Unfortunately they were all out of fancies when I arrived, so I was not able to sample one of them.  Perhaps if I did I would be more impressed.\nSince they had chicken readily available when I was there, I had to order it to find out what all the fuss is about.  I'm still trying to figure that out unfortunately. I ordered the dry curry rub, and was completely unimpressed.  Maybe I got the wrong flavor, but it was just alright. \nLike I said,if I ever happen upon Federal Donuts at a time when they have some fancies available I will certainly try one, but I won't go out of my way again for it."

The cinnamon was one of the standard donuts and they made it while I waited. The chocolate sea salt was a special flavor and I got the last one of the day. I was going to say it was \"good\", but I definitely scarfed it down in less time than it took for them to make my cinnamon donut, so I guess that should be a grade of \"good plus\". In the quick minute it took for me to gobble the first donut, the second was made. The cashier handed me the donut and it was warm and steamy in the bag. I was going to save it for later, but one whiff and I was done for. I ate it with even more graceless flair than the first and, I kid you not, it melted in my mouth.

Tried three of the donuts: the indian cinnamon which was reminiscent of fall festival cider donuts, the appollonia -- similar but upped a notch in terms of the flavor profiles, and the blueberry lemon pie -- tart and sweet. The appollonia is definitely my favorite, but they were all really good.

The bf and I both preferred the hots over the fancies just because it was a tad too sweet for our tooth.  But they were oh so tasty. My fave was the vanilla lavender, the scent was intoxicating.  Make sure you at least get\n2 each of the hots.  It was great that they did come out hot and fresh. It was about a 2 minute wait to get our order. The coffee was great as well.

Note this establishment is NOT for the anxious. We waited well over an hour (#43) for a half chicken and 3 donuts in a cramped space. We ordered the Za'tar which is one of their dry chickens. It was quite good but most definitely not worth that kind of wait. I for surely will never make the trip to Federal Donuts again, send someone else in for the dirty work."

I hope I never figure out how they make this donut, because the mystery makes it all the more alluring.\n\nOf course, the chicken is juicy, well-seasoned, and perfectly tender.  \n\nOne of the best parts is that they have these AMAZING PICKLES!!!!

I read an article about Federal Donutes in either T+L or AFAR... one of those online travel magz, and jasflksdjflaj it looked delicious, so I attested to not leave Philly without eating a fancy shmancy donut. \n\nWomp womp. Mission= failed. We first attempted a visit to the Sansom St. location and upon walking in, was greeted with the horror of a sign that read \"Sorry, we are out of fancies.\" That would just NOT do. I can get a regular ol' donut at a plethora of shops and restaurants anywhere on the map, and I was not wasting precious calories on something other than a creative hand-crafted rainbow-frosted sparkly fancy pants donut concoction. So, left store numbero uno, and made our way over to this location, crossing our fingers for some fancies (at this point, it was mid afternoon on Monday).\n\nWomp womp part deux. The same horrid \"Sorry, we are our of fancies\" sign was prominently displayed as we walked in. FFFF. At this point, we could have driven to one of the other locations (I didn't realize FDs was a chain?) but the outlook on any of the other stores having fancies was grim. We settled on ordering one of all three of the options available: vanilla lavender, chocolate (with a fancy name), and cinnamon (also with a fancy name). They were fresh, they were warm, but they were a let down. And actually, all three tasted really similar despite being totally differentiated flavors. I haven't had a donut in multiple years and I'm kind of disappointed that those were the ones that broke my streak. Don't get me wrong, they were sugary fried dough and there's nothing to hate about that - they tasted yummy and all, but they weren't the blueberry marscapone I had my sights set on. \n\nDidn't have the fried chicken. Didn't have the fancies. Wouldn't return (if I ever come back to Phily) unless calling before hand to ensure they weren't sold out of the good stuff which is probably what anyone who frequents a Federal Donuts has long since caught on to. Oh and FYI they don't have a restroom. PS FYI the girl working will chat your ear off."

We ordered 6 hot donuts, 6 fancy donuts, and 6 pieces of fried chicken. A little ambitious for three, but our eyes were bigger than our stomach after that long drive. On top of the donuts we ordered the cashier was super nice and gave us an extra hot donut, PLUS there were two honey donuts that came with the chicken!\n\nThe hot donuts were SO GOOD fresh from the fryer. They were soft and warm, but the sugar was a little messy. Ordered: strawberry lavender, milk n cookies (or was it cookies n creme...), cinnamon sugar\n\nThe fancy donuts had the texture of cake with frosting. We saved a few for the drive back and the fancy donuts still tasted good after a day. Ordered: Blueberry pancake, strawberry cheesecake, churro, tres leche\n\nI wanted to order one flavor per chicken but they only sell one flavor per 3 piece order. We got the dry rubs of buttermilk ranch and coconut curry. The crust was so crunchy! The rubs were good, but they tasted like the flavoring in a bag of chips. The 3 piece order came with 1 drumstick, 1 thigh, 1 breast - and the best part, the HONEY DONUT! \n\nOrdered a cold brew to go, just so we could try everything Federal had to offer.

Crispy, juicy fried chicken, tangy rooster sauce and crunchy, salty dill pickles on a fresh pillowy bun create a perfect flavor amalgamation. The blueberry pancake donut is amazeballs. Put it in a microwave for a few seconds and you're in for a real treat. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because not all of the donuts are that great - some tend to crumble away before you get them to your mouth- and the prices are a touch higher than they really need to be.

I also could not believe how much meat there was on each piece! The free doughnuts were not the hot or fancy kinds, just two regular doughnuts, but don't let that fool you-- they were DELICIOUS. We will be going back sometime soon to try the fancy ones-- Smores, Pina Colada, and Oatmeal Raisin are just a few of the flavors I saw.\n\nThe place is very small, so don't always count on there being space to eat there.

I ordered the half fried chicken  ($9.25) and a lemon ricotta doughnut  ($2.50). I didn't know that the chicken order comes with an old fashioned cake doughnut.  Wings are not listed on the menu but are available in an order of five for $9.25. Select a dry rub or a glaze to accompany the chicken but it is hot, juicy and delicious without adding to it. This business was featured on msn.com among the top 50 fried chicken places in America. They were spot on. For those of you doubting if a doughnut shack can get chicken right, I'm here to tell you that this twice fried chicken was golden brown, juicy and paired well with the doughnut.\nThis location is pretty quaint with a few pull down stools at the counter.

We ate in the car like all classy folks do.\n\nThis chicken is amazing.  Coming from a very southern, fry everything family, I was impressed.  My glazed wings were reminiscent of buffalo wings but with a much more complex flavor spectrum.

        "text": "There are a few indisputable facts about me.  I am not a fan of fried chicken.  I do not like donuts.  Hipsters make me itch.  So, what the hell was I doing at the long-awaited opening of Federal Donuts?  Standing on the sidewalk in front of the coffee/chicken/donut eatery this morning, I wondered the same thing.  I normally don't patronize restaurants on opening day as inaugural menus and service are usually as successful as the maiden voyage of the Titanic, but like most of the city, I was seduced by the hype.  After all, Federal Donuts has been the highly anticipated darling of Philly food editors for quite some time-with City Paper, Foobooz, and uwishunu keeping the buzz alive with numerous write-ups.\n \nIn my extreme na\u00efvet\u00e9, I thought my 11 AM arrival would give all the ironically cool hipsters time to get their coffee and donuts and get back to whatever hipsters do.  I was right-sort of.  I avoided the huge swell of people that one of the owners told me hit at 7 AM, but my fashionably late arrival was the culprit behind me not getting my hands on any of the fancy donuts.  Anticipating demand, the FedDo crew doubled their initial batch and, even though people were banned from ordering by the dozen, they sold out by 8:30.  A quick-thinking Michael Solomonov (of Percy St. Barbecue and Zahav fame and co-owner of Federal Donuts) ran out to get ingredients for another batch which-surprise-sold out as soon as they came out of the fryer.\n \nUndeterred, I decided to stick it out.  Forty-five minutes of waiting in the tiny space and I was rewarded with a sticky box that was near collapse from the dripping honey glaze of what turned out to be a pretty amazing meal.  (You'd be well-advised to shamelessly lick your fingers should this happen to you-completely worth it.)  The Korean style fried chicken had a beautifully crispy skin with deep nooks and crannies that caught the rivulets of sweet glaze and made it addictively good, but a serving of pickled veggies was unimpressive.  If, like me, you encounter a donut sell-out (of which I suspect there will be many), order the honey ginger chicken because it's the only bird that comes with a donut.  The donut, painted with a thinned-out honey mixture, was akin to a beignet which I considered a small miracle because I hate dense, cakey donuts.  Korean fried chicken and donuts may be the new Southern chicken and biscuits and guess what?  It works.\n \nIt may be too early to call, but I predict Federal Donuts will be a game changer-it's that good.  Chicken joints and donut chains should be nervous-very nervous.\n\n**UPDATE: I was informed by a sharp, hawk-eyed Federal Donuts employee that every chicken order comes with a donut.  I stand corrected.**"

Sunday morning has always had a spot in my heart for donuts because that's what I always did as a kid--got donuts on Sunday. \n\nI've followed Federal Donuts on twitter for quite a while now; I've read about their donut robot, their dilemmas, triumphs and their sell-outs. I needed to try this place. Little did I know that a donut trip at 11am on a Sunday morning would result in delicious food for the rest of the afternoon. \n\nThe donuts were delicious.  The pomegranate-nutella to the obscure creamsicle donut were the two 'fancy donuts' we tried, I was a huge fan of both. I was more of a fan of their simple 'hot fresh' selection, appollonia and indian cinnamon. The 'hot fresh' donuts are where it's at, simple, hot and fluffy, yet very solid--probably great for dunkin' in coffee, but I'm not 75 years old. \n\nOn to the real stuff, the chicken. The fried chicken was out-of-control. We opted to get one dry and one glazed order. Our dry order was the buttermilk ranch, which had a great balance of flavor, I was worried it would be too 'ranchy', that wasn't the case, it was a perfect ratio of buttermilk batter to ranch seasoning. The real flavor was the chile-garlic. This has to be my favorite glaze of absolutely anything that has been in my mouth, whether it be ribs, a burger, a friggin salad or even calamari, this glaze would be perfect on almost anything. The spice-to-sweetness ratio was near perfect, a little on the spicy side, so, if you're sensitive don't get it. \n\nI'm going to stop writing now because it's making me too damn hungry. Oh yeah, they sell out really fast so get there ASAP. \n\nFYI, they will be opening a new spot in center city soon. I also took off one star because it's too damn small in their current store front and they also ran out of iced coffee at 1130 am on a Sunday. A few kinks to work out in regards to fulfilling demand and this place will be a fried chicken and donut dynasty."

A patron asked the gentleman serving the food and working the register what \"type\" he liked best, as an assortment of dry seasonings and wet glazes are available for your chicken, though you can also order them \"naked.\"  He responded, \"They're all phenomenal, but Chile Garlic is my favorite.\"  That was all the persuasion I needed to reorder my favorite glaze.  As I waited for my number to be called, the two cooks in the kitchen looked up at me, on separate occasions, and smiled.  There's something really nice, almost indescribable even, about individuals working in a lightning fast-paced environment but still taking a second to greet the customer.  Likewise, the cashier made quick side conversation with me when I asked for something additional to my order though he was clearly swamped.  Such friendly folks here!!  When I got my order, I raced home, spread the contents on my coffee table, and basked in the aroma of Chile Garlic.  As usual, the wings were impossibly juicy and tender, the skin crisp despite a wet glaze, and the glaze itself - as good as it gets.  Note: Chile Garlic implies both spice and garlic breath.  Each chicken wing was actually a combination of the V-shaped wing and the drumstick-like portion you usually get in an order of wings but still connected.  In other words, each FedNut wing is really a combo of 2 wings still unseparated - and when you order 6, you're getting 12.  Beautiful.  I think you should all run, or rent a jet, and get yourselves to Federal Donuts a.s.a.p.  This place never disappoints."

So I figured that Sunday after Thanksgiving would be a good time to check out FD because lots of people would still be eating leftovers, and I think I was right.  I got there a little after 11:45 and was informed that they were just doing wings either 6 or 12.  I love bonchon chicken in NYC so the wings were a perfect option for me.  I got number 32 and ordered 6.  Total wait time was probably about an hour, but it was a nice day so brought my yelp book club book, and sat outside for awhile.  \n\nI went with the honey ginger which was really tasty.  I'm not sure how they do it, but the wings really weren't sticky, yet I could taste the sauce.  Some kind of magic.  The batter is light and super crispy, and the wings were really good quality, with lots of meat on them.  6 is def enough for one person.  I think the plan is for them to have wings every Sunday so I'll definitely be back to try the other sauces.  Bonus: you get a honey donut with the wings."

The double marshmallow doughnut was the first thing I bit into and was so delicious that I should've cancelled the rest of the order and got a half dozen of them and just ate and cried tears of joy from the flavors dancing on my taste buds. The other two doughnuts would've made for better spiced tea. I wasn't impressed, and the fried chicken was good but not great. I definitely recommend trying this place out for the double marshmallow doughnut and a coffee, but don't bother with the fried chicken or the spiced hot doughnuts."

How could I say no? \n\nWe walked in about 11:15 on Sunday, and there was basically no wait, and all the donuts were available. Since I'm allergic to dairy, I unfortunately had to skip the donuts. But I had a delicious cold-brew coffee as we waited for the fried chicken at 11:45. Even though they've been open for a while, there still were at least 20 people waiting for chicken orders at 11:45, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. \n\nI got the Harissa half chicken-you get about 4 generous pieces of deliciously seasoned chicken and a plain donut for $9. I only give four stars because it is kind of a shack...I guess I was expecting more of a fancy sit-down coffee shop atmosphere, but there's only about four benches (two inside and two outside) for sitting-and these are more for people waiting to order than to eat. There's about a park a few streets away, which is definitely better to eat your chicken in (especially if you're messy-who wants to be judged as they eat fried chicken?!!)"

Early in the morning when they open (sometimes) or an hour before they close is the best time to avoid the lines... the weekends good luck. \n\n I agree with Steve M. on this , fried chicken and donuts , oh mama could there even be a better combination than this?  I'll wait for a comparison ... ( Jeopardy theme song being played in the back) What is NOTHING compares to Federal Donuts in the donut realm.. nothing.  You are correct Nando, now lets see what you wagered, everything.. you are the champion . \n\nNow that I have wiped the tears of joy from my eyes, my sense of smell is in donut heaven with everything being made fresh it was time to order. I went with the  butter milk ranch fried chicken, an order of a 4 piece please instead of an 8 piece. I wasn't going to be greedy here, I do  want those donuts also, I could always get an 8 piece and bring it home for  the wifey and I. Who am I kidding if it even makes it that far, that 8 might turn into 1 by the time I get to the Walt Whitman. \n\nButtermilk ranch or the Glazed Chile -Garlic  for the win people, for the WIN! This is a twice fried over chicken which makes this delicious, they fry it first , then once you order they fry it again with whatever you choose. Every bite I had taken I could taste the ranch seasoning with nothing but delicious juicy chicken. Licking my fingers from the residue of that buttermilk ranch.\n\n I also enjoyed the glazed chile-garlic, Oh momma !  This perfectly spiced, not overbearing  where you can't enjoy it , nothing but perfect. I have just gone into cave man mode and started stuffing my face with this. Residue left over in my beard and upper lip is there serving a purpose which is. \n\n1) The drive home where I can lick my upper lip to remind me of heaven. \n\n2) As I kiss my wife I can make her jealous as she tastes and smell the residue of either buttermilk ranch, or the chile garlic on my upper lip and sides of my mouth . Sometime a beard is good, certain parts can be considered a flavor savor, not so sexy or appealing on women though . .\n\nWhat makes this an even better treat is they give you a complementary donut with your order, a delicious honey glazed. I am seeing a pattern here with the word \"Delicious\" 3 syllables 1 word could easily describe everything. De-Li-Cious.. Delicious. While I was enjoying every bite of perfection in front of me,  I was washing it down with some Dr. Browns cream soda.  Also they give a complimentary side of Japanese style pickles (I think it was) which were damn tasty \n\nNow here we go , this is the moment of truth, the donuts, their hot fresh donuts. AMAZING cake style donuts, that is deep fried for you right there. They do make specialty donuts also , but once they sell for the day I believe Porky Pig said it best \"That's all folks \" until the following morning.  I had the pleasure to try  the Chocolate peanut butter donut, along with the Indian Cinnamon, Apollonia spice and Vanilla lavender. \n\nWords can not be expressed , just sounds of pure bliss...  small moans or enjoyment with every bite of  mmmhh oh my god this is  hot and fresh and mmm. I don't think there is an adjective to describe this other than .. right still can't think of one, just eat one and you will see. I will bet you moan a little.\n \nRebecca is money behind the counter with the orders she was receiving. While I was wiping my mouth after annihilating this perfect blend of fried chicken and donuts , Rebecca made me an extra donut for free  for my travels. A  POMEGRANATE NUTELLA !! MY OH, OH MY! (In a George Takei voice)  This was fabulous , and I do have an infatuation with Nutella. \n\nGreat meal, great  service, I will be coming back more just to try more different flavors of fried chicken. Now what are you waiting for.. be gone and feast upon chicken and donuts.\n\nSide note. They will be opening up a Fednut in the ballpark this season. Phillies.. donuts... fried chicken, that is a homerun right there. \n\nDonut rankings in my opinion:\n#1 Federal Donuts  (King )\n# 2 Suzy Jo              (Queen)\n# 3 I don't care for, go and fight it out"

The chicken is moist, breaded perfectly along with the right seasonings.  As if that's not enough, the chicken is set off nicely with a slice of American cheese, a hint of spiciness from their \"rooster sauce\", and a slight tang from pickles atop it.  Finally, the potato roll finishes a great sandwich off with some sweetness.  Its not a very large sandwich so make sure you follow it up with one of their donuts.  I got the cinnamon brown sugar donut-- they're served hot and right out of the fryer I'm assuming.  The donuts are as good as it gets here.  They're a little pricey, but well worth it!"

I know this sounds bizarre but I eat a lot of chicken and the chicken I've gotten from federal donuts has a strange texture. It's more, I don't know... processed perhaps?? It looks compressed inside and it's always a bit pinkish. I've tried cooking it extra in our toaster oven but it still seems like bad turkey cold cut meat packed onto a chicken carcass.

Hot cakey donuts covered in crunchy flavored sugar. Also, their coffee is pretty good. If you want fancy donuts, go there early; I like a lot of them, but some are misses (I had a surprise half-dozen and didn't know any of the flavors but one of them was covered in a deep-red glaze, and that was the only one I didn't like).\nOnto fried chicken...also try that.

As you can see from my reviews I am not a nay sayer and give my honest opinion, based on my experience and preference. I know that I was expecting more from this place then it delievered on. I will give one disclaimer: I LOVE and adore Doughnut Plant up in NYC, and I do believe I measured this place, both in my imagination and experience up against DP, which may or may not be fair. Let me break down my experience for you:\n\nWe arrived early, just after 8am on Sunday morning on our way out of town to pick up a half dozen assortment for the trip. Just a few people were inside waiting for their orders. I placed my rather quickly and stood and waited for 10 minutes before the three \"hot\" donuts were made and added to the three other \"fancy\" donuts already waiting in a bag. I also ordered a cup of coffee too, knowing that they are getting a lot of props for coffee and wanted to check it out for myself. They mixed up the orders becuase they didn't take anyone's name when we ordered so it took a few seconds to right the mistake and off I went with my white paper bag of donuts and hot coffee in hand. By the time we were ready to partake in the donuts, all of the fancy donuts which had an icing were smushed and molded together and against the wax paper I am guessing because of the heat that came off the hot donuts. This is just a logistics issue that FD can figure out easily--offer a box if people are ordering a variety of fancy/hot donuts! I know they do have boxes because i saw them stacked and ready to go. It makes me wonder why weren't mine put into a box? \n\nOk, now onto taste. I was just not all that impressed with the consistency of the yeast and cake donuts. The cake donuts were too light and not cakey/dense enough for my taste. Also, by the time we ate them none of us could tell the difference between the flavors because of the problem I mentioned above. This, to me, is just an unfortunate and totally avoidable problem that can be easily remidied with more care and attention paid to their presentation and packaging. The fancy donuts were all yeast and each of them had icing. We got the pomegranite/nutella, banana/chocolate, mango/chili. The icing was just too sweet for me and the flavor was just overall lacking. If I had to choose one I liked the best I'd choose the banana because I could actually taste banana. The pomegranite/nutella could have been anything and the mango/chili was way too sweet and not spicy at all. Ugh. such a disappointement. And to top it all off, the coffee was just OK. I agree with other reviewers who say they have a very smooth, drinkable coffee. But, honestly, I wanted a bolder taste to cut through all that sweetness.\n\nSo overall, I would not say these donuts are bad, but they have not made a loyal customer out of this picky/high expectation donut seeker. Sorry FD! Donuts are one of those unneccesary treats and I would much rather spend my yearly donut quota on Doughnut Plant donuts any day over FDs."

And Federal Donuts does them both exceptionally well.  \n\nOn their second day, the donuts were sold out by 10 am. The menu lists nine varieties.  At 12:45, I was lucky to get a leftover honey donut.  I was also lucky to get the last half of a chicken, sold simply as a half chicken or whole chicken.  \n\nThe chicken is moist and tender and crispy without a hint of greasiness.  It is fried and  then served coated in you choice of three dry spices (za'atar, buttermilk ranch or harissa) or two glazes (chili-garlic or honey-ginger).\n\nSimply put, this is the best fried chicken I have ever eaten.  So good it could make you cry, mainly when you think about all of the time spent eating greasy, bland fried chicken.\n\nThe restaurant is small with limited counter seating.  They are clearly geared for take out.  And for $8, a box of half a chicken is a good lunch price point.  And the food way better than you'd expect for an $8 lunch.\n\nJust to emphasize how well this place is run, after selling out of chicken at 12:45, the owner and his team continued to line the counter with whatever pieces of chicken were left, and gave whole pieces away to anyone that stopped in.  This focus on the customer and a nice thank you for stopping in is a sure path to success.  Great start, Federal Donuts - I wish you much success."

I think they must have upped their supply, cause he suggested that selling out of chicken by 5 pm on a weekend was early.  It belies what the reviews say, and what the NYT article said, about the demand for chicken, but alas, I got my chicken.\n\nHalf Za'atar; half chile garlic. Oh em gee.  Amazing!  The chili garlic tasted a little like buffalo wings, and a little like general tso's chicken, but not quite...and was obviously 100 million times better than either of the two.  The za'atar was dry rubbed, and also amazing.  The lemon flavor really stood out.  Although fried, neither was overpowered with breading; you got a lot of meat.  And the meat was moist as ever, at that.  I couldn't decide which was my favorite, so I guess I'll have to come back for a second taste test.\n\nWe also tried two of the three regular donuts - appolonia spice and the cinnamon one.  They threw in a lavendar for free!  Win.  All were delicious, and as everyone has said, the donut itself is light, fluffy, moist, but also substantive, dense...and when served piping hot, it just melts in your mouth.\n\nThey also threw in two plain donuts with our chickens...

If a business only does 3 things, they better be on point and pretty much perfect.\nSo going down Federal Donuts' list.... \n\nCheck, check, check. Mission accomplished.\n\nYour next breakfast mission: get a little bit everything. The menu changes up so get whatever strikes your fancy. If you're getting donuts, coffee is required with the donuts. I couldn't care less if you're a tea person. Coffee is required. \n\nYour next mission impossible: Chicken is available after 11am, so keep begging the morning crew until the bosses hear about all the gluttons that want chicken sandwiches for breakfast. Cuz who wants fried chicken for breakfast? ME!!! Who else? Eeeeeeverybody. Even the vegetarians that don't know better."

I'm sure they'll get it together as time rolls on and they have a better idea of volume.\n\nNow, to the delicious, cakey donuts. I got a half dozen ($6 for 6 of the hot sugared donuts) to take to work- Indian Cinnamon, Appolonia Spice, and Vanilla Lavendar. Not surprsingly, they taste like hot sugared donuts (note the category they fall under, people). For fancier donuts, they have twice as many options and so far they do not disappoint. We've had the Chocolate Raspberry, Key Lime, and Pomegranate Nutella Tehina and they were spot-on. You may not taste every flavor they boast, but they are delicious nonetheless. \n\nOther fancy choices are Coconut Pineapple, Orange Blossom Pistachio and Honey Almond. As for the fried chicken, am I sick for wanting that for breakfast? I suppose so. I also suppose I'll have to venture out after work in hopes that they haven't sold out yet! I feel kinda sorry for the folks who live nearby. Not only do they have these delicious donuts (i.e. serious temptation) to contend with, but the smell of fried chicken lingers in the air as far as a two-block radius. Now that would require some serious withholding on our household's part!\n\nSpecial Note: There's three seats in the whole place. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are reasonable."

Served in a box, making you feel like you're grabbing your boxed lunch, it's always hot, fresh, and seasoned to perfection! The skin has the perfect crunch and the meat is always tender and juicy. You have a choice of several different dry seasonings and then you can pair it with a wet glaze. My favorite combination is the buttermilk ranch with the sweet soy garlic\n.\n.\nThe order always comes with one of their signature honey cake donuts although simple in nature, it's a perfect accompaniment to the chicken.

One of them doesn't even like pizza, for pete's sake - I can never take them anywhere.

We ordered, sat down at the counter, and  the wait wasn't long at all.  About 5 minutes later, our donuts were ready, and they looked and smelled so amazing we jumped on them. They lasted about 30 seconds, and then we got the buttermilk fried chicken - seriously, the best I've ever had.  \n\nThen, as if all that goodness weren't enough (a whole chicken, extra donuts and drinks for 3 of us was about $22!) the guy behind the counter said, \"ok, you each need an extra donut.  What'll it be?  It's on me.\"  He recommended the Strawberry Rhubarb special donut and it was the best donut in the world.  Delicious, cake-y, light, and the glaze was ... well, it was Scrumptious!

Donuts.\n\nBad news first: you probably don't live near there, and making the trek to Federal can be a pain if you're aren't someone who loves to walk (like yours truly). They make the donuts early in the morning, and they're often gone by the afternoon, especially if you go on a weekend. The chicken disappears just as fast. They have a small dining space, about a third of the size of the bar at your local diner.\n\nBut I'll be a monkey's great uncle if these aren't the best donuts and chicken you have EVER had.\n\nMandarin Coffee. S'mores. Vanilla-Lavender. These are just a few of the sophisticated flavors of donut you can experience. They had a Pomegranate Nutella donut a while back and I'm pretty sure I went in some kind of food trance when I tried it. At 1.25-2 dollars a piece, they're 2-3 times the cost of a Dunkin Donut but let me assure you the splurge is well worth it.\n\nNot to be outdone, the chicken is equally delicious and amazingly crispy. They've added a couple more seasonings to the roster since I've been there, but my favorite is still the Honey Ginger glaze. The messier the better, I say. If you want chicken, get here at 11 and WAIT. You'll be given a ticket, and you'll have to hang out for a while (with a donut and coffee, hopefully) but you'll have some of the freshest, crispiest, most scrumptious chicken you've ever had. I cannot stress this enough: it does NOT last long.\n\nI'd love to see this place get bigger: more seating and more chicken served per day couldn't hurt.

Standing in line or waiting for an order creates a sense that time has slowed down, and even the dust in the sunbeams may have danced for our forefathers. The combination of Korean style double fried chicken and deep dive dough balls is a natural fit for preparation, but I am not yet comfortable eating both at the same seating. The double dose of fats challenges my guilt. \n\nWhen we arrived mid-Saturday afternoon, all of the fancies were gone, but the 3 daily offerings were available.  Folks were gnawing on their chicken bones at the counter, blissful in their enjoyment.  We ordered a half doz mix of Vanilla Spice, Maple Brown Sugar and Strawberry Lavender to take with us on the drive home.  They were individually bagged while hot, and placed in a larger paper bag, and ultimately triple bagged in a plastic take out carrier.  \n\nOpening the package, the heat and moisture has made the paper sacks damp, but still held in plenty of the essence of the dough wheels. We tried a Vanilla Spice.  It was covered in sugar and cinnamon, cake-like, and uber sweet. The bite and chew was pleasant, but there was no crispness due to the water vapors.  Very tasty.  A very good donut.  Over the next day, the rest were devoured, and although the taste varied with content, the general experience was the same.  A nice round piece of cake with a hole in the middle. \n\nFederal Donuts deserves another house call earlier in the day when the fancies are in stock, and again for a unique fried chicken experience, which seems as varied as the sweet fat tires. \nAfter those ingestions, an update will be in order. \n\nUntil then, the consumed donuts themselves were not life altering, but were certain A-Okay!"

The parking here is hard enough for us who live here and paying high taxes is bad enough, getting a spot is next to impossible with the constant flow of these people who trash our block with chicken boxes & bags, leaving their trash on or in front of our homes. The owner should encourage his customers not to come into our neighborhood and make trouble for him by disrespecting the neighborhood like that, we didn't invite him here, the least that he can do is inform his customers to dispose of their trash in his disposal can and not our sidewalks and steps. There's talk of getting a petition together to get him out because of the problems that his establishment has bought. He doesn't live here, so he doesn't care about the block, but we do, there are families that have been here on this block for over 60 years, mine being one of them, we don't need this type of problem, why didn't he go to Society Hill and open a chicken place, he wouldn't because those people wouldn't stand for it, and we won't either. This is no Ghetto, and we don't appreciate this business trying to turn it into one. For those of you who patronize this business, I would ask you to respect our block, don't trash it, you wouldn't want anyone trashing where you live, so don't trash where I live !!"

Arrive well before that to enjoy counter seating and some of the non-fancy donuts, which are only available early in the day. Next time, that chicken is mine."

No good for dieting but oh so good in my mouth. I'm a little obsessed with the ranch wings with a side of the spicy chili sauce. And the honey donut that comes with the wings just goes perfectly together.

Not so much for this gut I'm trying to get rid of but I walk out extremely happy every time."

The meat inside remains juicy, but definitely cooked. Definitely some of the best fried chicken I have had.  A half chicken is cut up into four pieces but they way they cut it up you really do not recognize the pieces other than the drumstick.  Along with the chicken you also get a honey donut, as wel as some delicious Asian style pickles.\n\nPrice is not cheap, but quality never is.

I tried a donut for the first time- a fancy limited one: rose lemonade, which was fantastic and full of spot-on flavor. We ordered two chicken sandwiches to eat at the restaurant and then asked for 5 to-go, and for the buns, seasoning, sauce, cheese, chicken, and pickles to be packed separately. I had to bring some sandwiches back to my family in the burgh, as they were just as obsessed as us when they tried one last year.

        "text": "This place is getting a lot of love, and I can see why.  I applaud what they are trying to do.  But I'm going to be a little tough on them.  But just a little.  \n\nBeing a Delco guy, coming here means a 20 minute ride, and a minor struggle to find parking.  So this review will be based on whether it is worth it for a guy like me to make the trip.  I will admit that I made a special trip here on a day off just to try this place based on all the Yelp love.  Yes, you Philly peeps influence us Delco Yelpers on our trips into town.  \n\nI won't go into too many details on the serving experience.  I'll save details for the food.  But the people at the counter were very nice, and even cut up some donuts for sampling since it wasn't busy.  So kudos to them.  \n\nBut the issue is I showed up at noon, and from what I understand it's a much different experience then.  So I did not get to sample the hot donuts everyone raves about.  But I did try several of the fancy donuts and the chicken.  I think that's enough to give a fair review.  Now the play by play on the grub...\n\nThe chicken is decent, but not great.  The dry seasoning helps it taste better.  I suspect it might be better if you get it glazed.  For 9 bucks, they don't really give you a half chicken.  For instance, my order did not include a wing.  Half chickens include the wing, right?  I got a leg, a small thigh, and a breast cut into two pieces.  So I consider that a bit of a short change.  Bottom line is that although it isn't bad, I wouldn't give up KFC for it.  The honey glazed donut they give you is more fun to eat than a biscuit though.  \n\nThe rundown of what I sampled of the fancy donuts goes like this..,.\n\nChocolate-spicy peanut... it didn't work for me.  And the main reason it didn't work is that it's not completely chocolate.  It's one of the plain donuts with a chocolate coating and the spicy peanut just doesn't work as the topping.  This one was a letdown.  I say if you call it chocolate, the cake part should be chocolate as well.  Sorry guys... fail.  \n\nGrapefruit-brown sugar... this was a little more interesting.  Tangy and sweet.  Not their best in my mind.  But definitely worth the bites.  \n\nCaramel-banana... now we're getting somewhere.  This one hit the mark.  But at the same time, I didn't consider it memorable.  \n\nApple-walnut... this was the winner!  This is the donut I will consider driving into town for.  The apple taste was just perfect on this one.  Win!\n\nSo unfortunately, the verdict on whether or not a Delco person should make the 20 minute trip into town just for this place is \"not so much\".  But, if you happen to be in the area at the time it is open, it's worth a swing over there.  For a few interesting donuts and a good cup of coffee, it is a winner. \n\nBut while we are at it here, I'm certain that I would have rated this place more favorably if I could have tried the hot donuts.  This whole thing about only serving them until 11, and then serving something different after that is a problem to me.  It's two different experiences, and one is not as good as the other from what I can tell.  I consider this tactic more annoying and pretentious than anything.  But that's just me.  Thankfully, I know where Krispy Kreme is located."

        "text": "I went to Federal Donuts on the first day they were open. I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The fresh donuts were incredible, with a dusting of sugar not overwhelming the deliciously crumbly cake donut. The fancy filled donuts are a whole 'nother level, with creative frostings and fillings unlike you have seen at a chain. Neither the donuts nor the coffee survived my drive to work. \n\nI loved the space, just a small corner shop with lots of light, and a few clever fold-out stools at the counter. That first morning crowd gave me hope that they'd found a good business model. Little did I know that it was the calm before the storm.\n\nI'd been back several times for donuts, and never being disappointed, except to find that the perfect honey donut I'd had that first day was now being reserved for the afternoon's fried chicken orders. Getting a taste of that chicken would prove a challenge. There's a very narrow window with which you can obtain it.\n\nI finally did yesterday. I got there at the prescribed 11:45, and found the tiny space packed with people. I got to the counter and got my number: 43. The wait was somewhat torturous, nearly an hour outside, with the tantalising smell of the fryer emerging from the exhaust, and people digging in to their chicken on sidewalks and tailgates just outside.\n\nMy turn came and I ordered a half in honey ginger. Heading home with it, it took a great deal of willpower not to tear the box to shreds for 5 minutes. And then I regretted not doing so. The chicken was amazing, moist and crisp and sweetened perfectly by the glaze. It was expertly tender, with the meat pulling readily from the bone. The honey donut made for a nice compliment to the chicken, but the side of pickles didn't really do it for me, just something off about the flavor.\n\nWhile I wish them the best, hopefully the current furor abates somewhat. Selling out in the early afternoon helps build buzz, but it's frustrating to have to deal with the crowd and wait for the food. I'm not big on crowds so I waited outside, that's going to become increasingly difficult with the cold weather. Or if the demand stays strong, I have to wonder when a second location might be in the cards.\n\nBut really, if you're reading this in the morning, just run there now. Get the last of the donuts, or be first in line for the chicken. You won't regret it."

The chocolate and sea salt was my favorite (I tried a bite of my roomie's donut). \n\nThey have coffee and soda, which is great because some of us aren't big coffee drinkers and prefer cold and refreshing beverages with our donuts. The actual place is pretty small, just a counter with stools that fold out.

Parking was a bit of a pain, but we found parking without too much trouble. We were only going to get one donut for him, but when I saw the sign and read the description for the chicken sandwich- I knew I had to try one. \n\nI will say, I was a little disappointed in the small selection of donuts. I am a lover of all foodie things, but my favorite donut of all time, is glazed. Boring, I know- but I just love the classic glazed donut, and was sad that this place didn't have one. My boyfriend had the cinnamon sugar one and I had some bites- it was very good and fluffy and delicious. The chicken sandwich was OUT OF THIS WORLD. The cheese, the ranch, the sauce, the freshly battered chicken, the potato roll.. wow. I wish I would have ordered 5 of them.

Seats are a unique old style that you have to pull out from under the counter.  Have to see to believe.  \n\nIt was packed with people waiting for takeout at about 11:30 in the AM on a Sunday.  Only two counter people working as efficiently as they could to fill orders.  Two cooks in the back,; one on doughnuts and the other at the chicken.  No matter what I write you have to go to see this operation.\n\nJust like at the famous Philly Cheese Steak places this place is intimidating when trying to place an order.  Thankfully not because of the attitude, but more because we had not been there before and they were so busy that you did not want to take up a lot of their time.  Thankfully the waitress was very helpful when she realized we were new.  Took time to explain.\n\nOrdered a few types of doughnuts and a half chicken.  Chicken is small, but very tasty.  Got plain and then ordered a second with buttermilk ranch.  Buttermilk Ranch was disappointing. Seemed like powdered Ranch dressing was sprinkled over after cooking.  The four of us agreed on that.  Plain chicken is very good and I will keep to it when we go back.\n\nAll fancy doughnuts sold out so we got some plain and cinnamon brown sugar.  They were good, but would like to get there earlier to try the fancy one.\n\nWe were extremely lucky that the only four seats on the one side of the counter became available and we did get to sit down.  Also got to talk to counter people during a lull in business.Very pleasant people and took time to talk.\n\nWe will return to try the other doughnuts and get some more chicken.  It will fill you up for the day.  Not sure if it's the healthiest meal, but once or twice, may be three or four times a year will not hurt.  Another location near Center City and will have to try."

I will never set foot in one of your establishments again, rude before coffee never works for me. And I might add at this particular location while the very nice man in the back that make the donuts look professional the help at the front Often looks disgusting, pierced tattooed dirty and immature...

So we stop in, but it's around 1 pm and there are several menu items missing. No chicken wings....certain doughnuts are gone....the place is losing it's luster. However, I order some random doughnuts and get a whole chicken. The flavors are really creative and the combinations of flavor are truly unique. For the record never been a cake doughnut fan (love Krispy Kreme, hate dunkin), but their doughnuts are really really good. The chicken had some kind of ranch seasoning that was pretty good. I don't like to give in to racial stereotypes, but as a black man, I consider myself a fried chicken aficionado. It's some pretty good chicken. Good texture, juicy, but not greasy. So I'm in a tough spot. If the food was not good, they would have plenty and would never run out.

Fried chicken \n\nSince I don't eat chicken that mean it's donuts. And when it comes to donuts I want the fancy ones. My mouth was watering with the days flavors, lemon meringue, churro, chocolate eclair, butter pecan and guava poppy seed.  My friend and I had a couple cups of coffee before we even left the house and another pit stop for iced coffee before arriving. We were caffeinated enough as is. They have their own coffee brand at this joint too. What they don't have which is a huge pet peeve with me is a b-a-t-h-r-o-o-m!?! How can one serve coffee and food and not have facilities. Alright, I'm done with my rant. \n\nWhen we walked in and I ran over some people to be informed the door lead to the basement and not a bathroom, I embarrassingly crawled over said people and back to the front. The place seats maybe like 6 people around the counter a couple people on a bench in the back and a couple more on the outside bench. I noticed there was one last Lemon Meringue. I have a weakness for lemon desserts. But just like that the person in front of us ordered the last one and away it went. So like I said come early so your donut dreams aren't crushed. We were still able to get some fancy donuts like guava poppyseed and butter pecan but everything else was sold out. They had their fried donuts, cinnamon brown sugar, strawberry and lavender and vanilla spice. We got a half dozen, half fancy and half freshly fried. \n\nWe sat on the outside bench and the heat from the fried donuts melted our fancy donuts a little. The guava poppyseed was glistening! I had my first bite and it was just like guava! The taste was extremely fresh and bright! Sometimes cake donuts can get heavy or dry but these still had some fluffiness to them. And I had a bite of my friend's butter pecan and it wasn't too sweet. Everything was well balanced and also not to heavy or dense. \n\nI will be back but it might be just as the door is unlocked and Federal Donuts is open for business. \n\nI also heard there were David Lynch donuts here and that the cherry pie donut was too die for. I adore Twin Peaks and if they happen to be around when I'm back in town, I will surely be here right off the NY bus!"

But to only have 3 flavors left at 11AM?!\n\nI did a sticky bun - Not really impressed. It was dry, and wasn't too tasty. My wife got the Banana Cream. It was better, and between the two of us we finished that one off.\n\nMaybe the customer service made the donuts less desirable. When you start off feeling like the staff doesn't care I think it drastically damages the experience."

Honestly, it might be the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. My boyfriend said the same thing. It's just perfect. The bun is so fresh, the breading on the chicken is so tasty with the ranch seasoning and the crunchy flaky batter, the sauce packs just the right amount of heat, the melty cheese adds that creamy taste, and the thick slices of pickle is what you need to tie everything together. We loved this sandwich and wished we could have bought more to bring back to Pittsburgh with us. Mhmmmmmmmm."

The dude who helped me must have been having a really bad morning because he was not friendly at all. They had 4 fancy donuts available, but I only chose 2, the cookies and cream and the gingerbread flavors. I wanted to try them all, but that would be bad for new years resolution! All joking aside, the donuts were awesome! Upon inspection, it looked like it was just glaze over the donut which distinguished the flavors, but they really tasted like the flavors describe! The donuts are soft and moist. They are definitely worth the calories! Now I must come back to try the chicken!"

Sadly I was only able to get here around lunch time, so they only had a few of the 'Fancy Donuts' available. I was able to try their Chocolate Sea Salt, Pumpkin Spice Latte, and the three 'Hot Donuts': Apollonia, Indian Cinnamon, and Vanilla Lavender. I highly recommend the Indian Cinnamon and the Chocolate Sea Salt. The Pumpkin Spice Latte held up to its name, although I don't think it's as good as the Chocolate Sea Salt. The Vanilla-Lavender was very subtle which I liked and the Apollonia to me was just your normal sugar donut. Unbeknownst to me, all of their donuts are cake donuts and not yeast based. I'm more a yeast based donut lover but these were just as excellent. The donuts were not greasy, not too sweet, and the cake texture was moist.\n\nI wasn't really interested in getting the fried chicken at the time, but by the looks of the trays, there was still plenty to keep them open to 3pm."

When you were assigned a number as you walked through the door to enusre you were guranteed a few pieces of that fried goodness before the limited supply ran out. Do, I think it is the best fried chicken on the planet? Of course not, but it damn sure borders and is quickly encroaching on the top spot.\n\nOn my first visit here, my friend suggested that I  try the buttermilk ranch. It was different but it was ok. It took me sometime before I made my second trip due to a weight lost competition at the office.  On my second visit I was told to try the chili-garlic; \"ok now we are starting to push the envelope\" I said to my friend and coworker. I was a little apprhensive about eating my fried chicken in wet glaze. I want crispy friend chicken not a soggy mess. My friend tried to ease my fears by telling me to just think of it as a giant buffalo wings. If you go in there feeling the same way I did, leave your fears at the door because the chili-garlic chicken was, excuse me...is amazing. \n\nEarlier this week I finally had the opportunity to visit Fednuts for some morning coffee and doughnuts. The coffee is pretty decent. The doughnuts tasted exactly what everyone has been raving about. I ordered a creamsicle and a chocolate coconut doughnut. I was only able to finish the creamsicle. The doughnuts are way too sweet for this pancakes, eggs, and bacon guy in the morning. I am sticking with croissants, bear-claws, and bagels if I want pastries in the morning. \n\nP.S.

Later that night, after a lot of drinks, someone turns to Chef Solomonov. \"Yo, dude, you know what you should do? You should totally open a restaurant inspired by that sign. You would serve three things: coffee, donuts, and chicken.\" And he would reply, \"man, I could totally make that work.\" Then one of his friends turns to him. \"OK, Mike, you think you're all that?

The half-chicken order came as four pieces -- a leg, a thigh, and two breasts, each covered in a crispy, spiced exterior and a well-cooked, toothsome, and succulent interior.  They were, truly, finger-licking good.  The order also came with a free doughnut side, which was nice.  Speaking of donut (a)sides, FedNut's doughnuts are tasty, but they really don't amaze me like they seem to amaze many others; something about their texture doesn't appeal to my palate and they're not worth the journey out to 2nd and Federal (but the fried chicken is). \n\nThe chicken seems reasonably priced, all things considered.  If you want traditional sides, you'll have to get them elsewhere -- no mashed potatoes or biscuits here.  The seating is limited to a few spots around the counter, where the seats are a unique swinging I-beam thing; check'em out.  There's also coffee here, made in several cool-looking drip devices."

        "text": "I now know that Federal Donuts is the absolute bees' knees for locals who swear by their outstanding donut creations.  However, I did not know this fact until right before our planned weekend getaway to Philly, when a foodie friend of ours (who also happens to be an editor at a swanky food mag), posted a message about feening to return to Philly just for Federal Donuts' Pomegranate-Nutella treat.  And what do you know, this gal loves Nutella!!!  Call it then, serendipitous that I made it a point to come to this S 2nd street location to explore the reasons why this place came with such high recommendation(s).\n\nWhat I like about Federal Donuts far outweigh what I don't like about it.  So I'll start with a few negatives.  \n\nTHE NOT-SO-GOOD:\nThe shop is situated on a somewhat seedy stretch of neighborhood.  It's nice that it's right on the corner of the street, and in a low-key, residential area, but at the same time, I'd probably feel a cold sweat running through my body if I had to walk around these parts at night.  Naturally then, you should try your best to come here early before it gets dark, or before the shop gets hounded with customers.  Because even in a relatively remote location, Federal Donuts packs in their devotees quite early in the day and you can certainly expect crowds to swell until they run out of donuts (and fried chicken) to sell.  We thought we had come early enough (shortly before noon), but we were mistaken.  I must have waited on line for 30-40 mins to order two donuts and some wings.  And the donut that I came here for (pomegranate-nutella) was all SOLD OUT by the time we ordered.  Pooey.  \n\nAnother downside, is their strange ordering system.  It's a bit confusing if you've never gone here and have no idea what the drill is, but apparently, there's a two-part process if you want to get donuts and wings.  It's not as seamless as you'd wish, and I'm not exactly sure if this system they've drummed up actually helps the line go by faster, or if it is causing a lot of stalling and waiting.  To me, it seemed inefficient.\n\nTHE VERY GOOD:\nBelieve the hype.  These donuts are amazing!  Texture wise, they are ever so gently crisp on the outside, yet incredibly soft and cake-y on the inside.  And you simply can't beat the inventive and fun variety they have on offer.  You have a choice between their \"FANCY\" donuts (Creamsicle . Chocolate Covered Banana . Mandarin-Coffee . Strawberry-Rhubarb Pie . Pomegranate-Nutella . Mango-ChileHot), or their \"HOT FRESH\" donuts (Appollonia . Indian Cinnamon . Vanilla-Lavender).  They are nice enough to cut up some samples of the hot donuts while you wait in line to place your order.  The donuts are favorably priced (there's a premium for the Fancy donuts, of course).\n\nFancy pricing:\n$2 each $12 half dozen $20 dozen\n\nHot Fresh pricing:\n$1.25 each $6 half dozen $11 dozen\n\nAnother main draw to Federal Donuts is their FRIED CHICKEN.  I would have to say THIS was the utter surprise of our trip to Federal Donuts and stole the show for me and the bf, as we were not expecting to have such tasty wings from a donut shop in Philly.  They were out of this world, from another dimension of deliciousness and would easily best some of the finest Korean Fried Chicken you'd find in New York.  \n\nWe had an order of 6 wings, wet glazed with honey-ginger.  Since there was no space to devour our wings at the shop, we decided to eat them in the car (keeping things classy is what we do), while they were still nice and hot.  Let me tell you, these wings were phenomenal... so tender, flavorful, and juicy.  It was no surprise to me that boxes upon boxes of their fried chicken were flying out of the Federal Donut kitchen.  An added treat is the fact that you have OPTIONS, and can choose amongst six different flavors (4 dry seasonings, and 2 wet glaze flavors).  Btw, you can't mix.\n\nTo top off all this goodness, the folks at FD manning the operation, are all so nice and patient, and quite friendly.  \n\nThe popularity of this place is no doubt gaining more and more momentum and will hopefully lead to further expansion, and quite possibly an empire....?!  Let's hope by the sheer Federal Donut fan volition, the craze spreads to New York!!!"

I'm starting to think you don't actually have chicken but pay people to line up outside and talk about how awesome it is.  If you do actually have chicken you must be seeking clientele that have nothing better to do than wait outside for hours to get a ticket to get mediocre chicken.  Then you can spend the rest of the afternoon drinking PBR.  \n\nIf you only serve chicken for 15 minutes from 11:30-11:45 before you run out, at least have the decency to take down your chicken sign, and start serving gin in spaghetti cans the rest of the time."

We picked up a dozen of the fancy donuts (4 different flavors) and we were blown away! Didn't try the fresh hot donuts, but we'll be back to give them a shot too. The ice coffee was also incredibly good!\nA little crowded on a Saturday morning, but with amazing donuts like this, I can definitely see why!\nI was a little disappointed that they don't start serving the chicken until 11:00, because we wanted to try it too. I guess that means I'll have to go back for that!"

Today I decided to order a whole meal from here since it was in the middle of the afternoon and my girlfriend and I haven't eaten yet. The service is friendly and patient as I asked the cashier for recommendations. \n\nWe ordered our usual half dozen hot and fresh donuts, half cinnamon brown sugar and half cookies and cream. We ate one donut as we waited for the rest of our order which didn't take long. It was delicious as always. \n\nThe fried chicken, sandwich, and fries didn't take much longer and we were on our way home to enjoy this meal. My girlfriend's sandwich was very good, the chicken was fried well and the potato roll was perfect for this sandwich. However, it was very small and probably wouldn't fill me up. I was very disappointed in my chicken. For $10 I got 3 small pieces of chicken. One of the thighs was undercooked as it was very pink inside. The undercooked chicken even had someone's hair in it. So for $10 I was only able to eat 2 pieces of chicken. The chili garlic glaze was sort of underwhelming. The glaze wasn't spicy it wasn't garlicky, it wasn't much. I enjoyed the fries more than the chicken, unfortunately. \n\nI would still go to Federal Donuts, but only for their donuts."

And when you do, here are some things to keep in mind:\n\n1. It's small and it's busy. So there's that. If you're not into that, maybe skip it.\n\n2. If you're ordering chicken, you have to take a number TO ORDER. You get the number. You wait. They call your number. You order. You pay. You wait. Then you get your chicken. This is an unfamiliar ordering process for most of us. It can be upsetting to have routine disrupted and expectations unfulfilled; however, it's important to remain calm. You will eventually get chicken. The people helping you are very nice and would really like to furnish you with some chicken. Please don't be a dick. You're not going to change anything and everyone in there will just dislike you and who wants that? No one, that's who.\n\n3. They very often run out of the fancy donuts early. Preparing oneself for this possibility may make it easier to accept if and when this occurs. \n\n4. The chicken is ok. It's not life-changing. Honestly, is any food stuff life-changing? I mean, unless it's like wheat or milk or beef or you're starving or something. But it's pretty damn good. I liked Resurrection's better."

        "text": "Fantastic!\n\nThis is a review from a donut snob. Seriously. I've eaten a lot of donuts in my travels and most are disappointing. I have a single, favorite donut shop in California, but living on the East Coast now, that's rather moot. \n\nI saw a review of Federal Donuts a while back and have followed them on Facebook for several years. However, we live about five hours away so it was never really practical to visit. In a stroke of luck, I happened to attend a meeting that took me near Philadelphia, so I decided to drive out of the way and stop by the closest Federal Donuts.\n\nThis location is literally a hole in the wall...I would never have known the location was there unless my nav system said it was. Purely a residential neighborhood; I didn't see another business anywhere. I thought it was closed at first, but I parked, knocked on the window, and sure enough - I was in luck! They were open and the rest is history.\n\nBecause I wanted to try everything, I ordered a half dozen of their hot and fresh, a half dozen of their fancy, and two chicken sandwiches (I had a couple of my kids with me - I'm not as much of a glutton as I appear! LOL) \n\nSo how were they? We tried the hot and fresh donuts while they were still hot. I have to say - they were really, really good. Unfortunately, I didn't get a photo of their menu, but the donut with the cinnamon sugar coating was the best of the three, even though all of them were great. I really liked the texture, the flavor, the amount of sugar coating. Overall, they were really, really great. Better than any other donut I've had on the East Coast, hands down.\n\nI then went on to try the chicken sandwich. I loved the crunch of the fried batter. I've seen a couple of complaints that the chicken seemed dry; it didn't seem that way to me. My only complaint was that it did seem quite salty - and I'm typically one who likes extra salt! Would I eat another one, absolutely! Would I recommend cutting back on the salt a bit? Yep, I think that would help. I did eat part of the second sandwich and it seemed less salty, so maybe the first one was a bit of a fluke. Still...would I eat another? You bet!\n\nWe waited till we got home to try the fancy donuts. The snowball was by far the favorite by both taste and texture. It was a hands-down winner. The rest were really good. The donuts disappeared in this order: snowball, peanut butter cup (that was really good), banana (surprisingly good!), apple pie, blueberry (I liked it; my teenagers didn't as much), and then the chocolate cream one. I think that's the name...it was chocolate coated with a yellow dollop in the middle. The texture was great; the flavor was lacking, in my opinion (my kids liked it though). \n\nOverall, I really think these are the best donuts on the East Coast. Or at least the best donuts I've had an opportunity to try. The texture is amazing, and for the most part, the flavors are really fantastic. The chicken sandwich was a bit salty for my taste, but I'd definitely eat it again for certain. \n\nMy recommendation: if you haven't tried Federal Donuts, you need to! I most highly recommend them and support them as a non-chain local business too. I really wish they'd open a shop closer to me because I'd be there as a regular (then again...my waistline might not appreciate that...LOL). Anyway, the bottom line is this: I most highly recommend Federal Donuts and if I'm within an hour or two of Philly in the future, I'll make the drive and pick up some!"

So they literally sell just drinks and a few hot donuts for 4 additional hours (website says they close at 6pm) but dont bother to make any more fancy donuts? We have been going here for years and this has never been a problem and spare me the Covid excuses because we ordered pickup in the middle of the pandemic several times without any problems.

But my husband, a donut enthusiast, was not overwhelmed by them back then. \n\nThis time we decided to go back and give the chicken a try. We got a donut as well, just in case we caught them on a bad day on our previous visit. \n\nThe donut was just fine; husband would eat them again but they aren't his favorite. But the Vietnamese iced coffee was delicious. I'd return for that alone. \n\nHowever, the chicken was the real reason I'll be back. Husband's chicken sandwich was good. But the 3-piece fried chicken with coconut curry spices was excellent. Crispy, juicy, tender, and not at all greasy. I took one piece home for a later 2nd meal. \n\nHenceforth, I shall refer to this place as Federal Fried Chicken, as that is why I go there."

Pretty much like eating in your favorite relative's kitchen.\n\nFederal Donuts has three selections - donuts, coffee, and fried chicken.  Food aside, I love the concept of restaurateurs with successful full-service concepts (Zahav and Percy Street BBQ) adding a casual, inexpensive option, hyper-focused on a limited menu items to their portfolio.  I think this is a trend we'll see more of in Philly.\n\nI visited on a morning so I missed out on the chicken (just my luck!)  so I can only speak on the donuts and coffee.\n\nI tried the vanilla-lavendar and a spicy chocolate with nuts, the latter of which isn't currently on the menu.  Suffice to say you won't find innovations like these at Dunkin' or even Krispy Kreme.  Both were really good.  And the coffee was smooth.\n\nI can't wait for my next visit - so many more donuts to try and, yes, the chicken!  I'm salivating already.  A fifth star is a no-brainer."

My friends and I split the vanilla lavender, Apollina spice, Indian cinnamon, key lime, chocolate raspberry. When we tore into them we were super pleased. They were delicious. The vanilla lavender was a little stronger than I'd like, and the key lime / chocolate raspberry have fillings in them / are more like pastries. But all of them were delightful.

Finally give in to my curiosity and drove all the way from KOP to give it a try.\n\nThe store is at a residential neighborhood,  so street parking only.  I got there at 8am on a Saturday, found the parking couple blocks away.  There were already 15 or so people waiting in line.   The store is not big, most people are ordering take out, there are 3-4 seats inside, nothing fancy.  The ordering is pretty efficient; a young lady on the register, one other boxing the donuts; there are couple more working in the back. \n\nHot donuts are prepared as you order; fancy ones are ready made. $1.25 for hot ones; $2 for fancy ($20 for a dozen).  They also have their own coffee.
