The Koreancini (fried rice and corn balls) were crisp and sweet and salted to perfection. The Kale Salad was big but not overwhelming and the dressing is perfection. We also got the stone pot bibimbap with tofu. The tofu was expertly cooked and the entire dolsat was flavorful but not too spicy. The relish on the BBQ tofu tacos was pickled heaven. \n\nThe white and red sangria were both excellent as well. My friend doesn't even like white sangria and she loved mine. There were also beers, wine, and cocktails that we still have yet to try!\n\nCannot wait to return!"

Fast forward to Sunday, we were looking for a quick place to grab brunch and I suggested we try Southgate. We were able to find street parking nearby for free . When we got inside we were immediately seated and were able to identify several menu items that looked really yummy  the prices were all pretty decent (a meal and a mimosa will run you about $20). When the food came out everything tasted great (the fries are AMAZING). And last but certainly not least, our server Dan was super attentive and helpful. Overall it's a nice option for a casual weekend brunch if you're not trying to do a boozy brunch but still want a little booze."

Compared to other bibimbaps I've had in the past, the one I had at Southgate wasn't too heavy on the sauce.

That being said, with all of the hard surfaces, it is hard to hear yourself think when the place is busy, let alone have a conversation at the table.  They are still developing the menu, so I wasn't able to see the full range of offerings they have.  I had the salad with the sushi tuna and rice.  It was a wonderful combination of tuna, daikon, fennel, pickled ginger and rice.  I found the chili sauce a bit too hot for my personal taste, but would not fault the restaurant for that.  Servers were anxious to please.  The biggest downer was the noise level.  When I mentioned it to our waiter he said that sometimes it's more relaxed and quiet (like when nobody is there?).  Some sound-absorbing materials would help to quiet the place down.  I don't want to have to yell across a tiny talbe for dinner or yell at the waitstaff to order.

But check the menu before you visit. It is not like other Korean or Korean inspired restaurants I've experienced in the Philadelphia, NYC  and  Baltimore area. In my experience, the side dishes (Banchan) accompany the bibimbap and other main courses and aren't usually a la carte.  There are usually several accompanying little delicious dishes plus kimchee with most entree choices. This is not like those restaurants and the prices and the a la carte sides were a surprise. I recommend going there to enjoy the drinks and wonderful  service the waitstaff provides. But in the Center City area, I recommend going to Washington Avenue, 10th Street, or Chinatown for a less expensive and more authentic Korean (U.S) dining experience. \n\nMy friend loved the burger option which was well seasoned, spicy and flavorful. He loves spicy food and was happy with his choice. Our waiter, the hostess, the bartender as well as the cooking staff were lovely, friendly and anticipated all of our needs."

The tacos were the best, the burger next, and the Korean Fried Chicken was good but not amazing. I don't have much comments on the tacos and burger other than that they were good, tender meat, and very flavorful. I loved the gochujang-ketchup sauce given for the fries (included side to the burger). For the Korean Fried Chicken we tried both the spicy and soy; I love spicy food but think the soy had slightly more depth of flavor. We agreed that we actually slightly prefer the trashiness of BonChon Korean Fried Chicken (and their spicy wings are spicier!), so if you're a big fan of BonChon, I'm not certain you'd enjoy the KFC they have here--but try for yourself and see!\n\nIn the future, I think we would order just the Tacos and Burger between us, which would be a very reasonable price and leave us feeling comfortably full.

Food/drink selection wasn't as expected. Where's the pajeon and ddeokbokki?? No makgeolli either and the soju is muddled in a fancy cocktail priced at $12 (with that price I could buy 3 bottles of plain soju a few blocks down at Wine and Spirits!) I guess I was hoping too much that it would be a like Hongdae bar. The location of the bar should have been a dead give away that it would be catering to a different crowd and taste. Actually it's my fault for not reading articles regarding this place beforehand--they did say it was going to offer \"Korean inspired flavors\". Oh, so you are one of those places that add kimchi to food and call it Korean.\n\nI'd probably come back for the wings and sweet potato fritters on a late Sunday night when it's not so noisy. Defintely not going to have the bulgogi burger or spicy pulled pork sandwich again because they were just ehhh.

Seating was a little tight, but that's probably due to the fact that it's a pretty small space. They also have seating outside but it was pretty warm that day.\n\nOnto the food, we ordered the coconut and cardamom infused soju, the  \"KFC\" wings, fried rice, the poke bowl (can't remember the name), the bibimbop, and the matcha fruit tart.\n\nI liked all the food, it was freshly made, however, it didn't wow me. The Soju tasted more like cardamom than coconut but it was pretty strong. The wings were good, but I think I'm one of those rare people who are not impressed with Korean fried chicken wings (don't hurt me, I like buffalo wings). My favorite part of the meal was the fried rice it had sausage, kimchi and all that good umami flavor. The poke bowl was just ok, the flavor was good, but it had very little fish. And my dinner partner had the bibimbop which I did not try but he enjoyed it.

Honestly, if you don't eat Korean food EVER then this place will be AMAZING to you. The place is clean and sleek, the chicken wings are bomb, and bibimbap is not an item that is easily accessible in center city. But if you are like me and regularly eat Korean food, $2 per wing, $3 for fermented cabbage that usually comes free, and ~$15 for a bowl of rice and veggies in a stone bowl are just not worth it.\nOn the plus side, at least this place is helping Korean food become more mainstream."

        "text": "I only knew about Southgate from a video about their brunch menu and how they make delicious korean fusion dishes. Typically I'm hesitant when trying korean fusion dishes as I often feel like the flavors aren't handled properly when trying to americanize or change traditional korean foods (or maybe I'm just a korean food snob? or both??) but I must say... I loved my experience at Southgate this past weekend! \n\nI started brunch off with their kimchi blood mary, which was spicy! I was actually very happy with the spice level but also how they use kimchi to elevate the bloody mary. I didn't think it was too overwhelming which was what I was embracing for. I enjoyed the spicy house-made soju shot that it was paired with as well. It was like a nice little cool down break from the kimchi Bloody Mary :)\n\nMy friends and I decided to do tapas style for brunch so we could taste as many things as possible. Best idea ever! We started with the kimchi deviled eggs which were tasty. Again, I am pleased that they were able to subtly infused the kimchi within the dish, which wasn't overwhelming or overbearing by any means. But it also wasn't just adding kimchi on top of a traditional deviled egg. I believe they blended the kimchi and some sesame oil in the egg mixture which really just made the mixture smooth with a hint of sweet and spicy. They had four pieces so it's easy to share.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the kimchi poutine, short rib and korean fried chicken (KFC) and green tea waffles. It is hard for me to choose one clear favorite, mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. The kimchi poutine was delicious and I loved that the fries and cheese on the stone bowl continued to cook and get crispy even at our table. They don't have any gravy on this dish (like traditional poutine), but it works out very well. Very easy to share. The KFC and green tea waffles were a huge surprise to me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the waffles that much, mostly because I wasn't too sure about green tea waffles... but it was very good! And paired with super crispy KFC was like icing on the cake. I wish the chicken was spicy though, that would have definitely put it over the top for me and been a favorite. Lastly, the short rib dish was good though it doesn't stick out as much as the other two. My friends really enjoyed the short rib itself, but I was under the impression it was suppose to be like galbi so that let me down a bit--still good but just not what I had been expecting. The short rib was placed in a huge bowl with rice, two eggs and jalape\u00f1os. The nice surprise was the sweet soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl, where the rice was soaking it up--it really brought the dish together.\n\nOverall, Southgate is a wonderful place to experiment with Korean fusion dishes. One of my friends had never had korean food before and really enjoyed our dining experience here. I like that they offer a variety of things outside what you'd expect. I will most definitely come back here for brunch the next time I'm in Center City! Especially for the spicy kimchi Bloody Mary :)"

The bartender was lovely and attentive and happy to sell us more slightly overpriced drinks.\n\nWe tried the Korean fried chicken wings, which were delicious and way overshadowed the potato fritter/dumpling thing we also got. The vibe is clean and modern, but also dark and intimate. They fit seating in practically every square inch of the place, which is probably a good thing, since it was pretty crowded even at the soft opening. I LOVED the wallpaper in the bathrooms.

After tax and tip, that's $31 for BI BIM BAP AND A 10 OZ IPA.\n\nOof."

After going3 for happy hour, drinks, and dinner multiple times I decided to have my birthday here. The staff made it a wonderful night. Lisa and Juan at the bar are among the friendliest not to mention skilled bartenders out there whose signature drinks (especially the hot toddy) are delicious and beautifully presented. Our waitress, Lyndsie was very attentive and made us feel at home. \n\nWhile the drinks here are phenomenal, the real treat is the food. No trip to Southgate is complete without indulging in the Korean Fried Chicken, the double fried, crispy perfection topped off with either a soy garlic (my favorite) or spicy gochujang sauce. The chicken katsu is another favorite of mine. This tender, breaded chicken is topped with a Korean bbq type sauce served with a side of rice and a little cabbage salad. I love this dish for the variety of flavor and the portion is huge!\n\nI tried the bibimbap for the first time during my birthday dinner, choosing the hot stone pot option which I highly recommend!  While the presentation of this dish is marvelous, its encouraged that you mix it up before eating. The contents of your bowl continue to cook while you eat and the rice gets nice and crispy. The beef served with this dish was tender and flavorful and the spicy sauce was a perfect way to top it all off.\n\nOverall I recommend Southgate very highly. This is a great place to grab some drinks, snacks or a full meal. My mouth is watering just writing this."

Like the tofu tacos - tofu and some mayonnaise for $12? The drinks are good, but they're nearly Franklin Mortgage prices for small, above average cocktails. \n\nDefinitely worth a try, but two apps and three drinks set us back almost $75 with tip, so it's just not a place we can really frequent. Definitely stop by for the wings though."

As a main dish I had the burger - just voted Best of Philly - and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was pretty awesome.

But, sharing in case you're a Korean food fan!\n\nKorean is my favorite cuisine to go out and eat. I've yet to find any Korean food here in Philly that compares to the yummy little Korean spots in Cherry Hill. I was hoping Southgate would be my new sorta-pricey-but-worth-it Korean spot!\n\nI was disappointed to see no nengmyun, soon dubu, kimchi jigae, etc - just japchae and basic dolsots. \n\nI ordered japchae, my fella had a dolsot. For my pallette, it was by far the worst japchae I've ever had - the mushroom sauce was overpoweringly strong, the beef was little hunks of steak instead of shredded stew meat, there was so much oil in it I could hardly eat it. You can't go wrong with a dolsot of course and my partner enjoyed his meal. Their kimchi didn't rank for me, either."

Heavily influenced by both modern food culture and our Korean roots, we feature craft beer, wine, an impressive spirits list, and food that takes a creative direction through traditional Korean to classic American.\" Since reading that description over a year ago and bookmarking Southgate and also reading a ROTD by Nando F., I finally and much too long over due dined at Southgate.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the corer of 18th and Lombard and has both seating inside and outside. We chose to inside as it was only 6:00 PM and still warm outside. The inside is modern, cool and pleasant. It is a very comfortable space.\n\nMy dining companion on this night, who is also daughter, and myself ordered with three small plates. KFC - Korean Fried Chicken, Short Rib Steamed Buns and Pan Roasted Octopus. The steamed buns were the first to appear and these were soft and fresh and had some heat. They were much different then the Chinese style ones we were used to and came with a spicy dipping sauce. The octopus was very tender and had great flavors. It came with a Kimchi style sauce and baby corn. The KFC was excellent. The chicken was crispy, moist and flavorful and we preferred the spicy Gochujang sauce over the soy garlic.\n\nSouthgate also has a decent beer list on tap and in bottles. We were fairly full with the three small plates and we passed on dessert. I am looking forward to returning to Southgate to try Korean Steak Tacos and the Bulgogi burger. I really liked the concept and I hope that Southgate will continue to do well."

Seating didn't take very long depending on when you arrive but the portions were slightly small for the hefty price. \n\nI grabbed the KFC which was $12 for 6. The chicken was very crunchy and more importantly, the chicken was juicy. Additionally, the sauce was sweet and not overpowering. Also grabbed a Dolsot Bibimbap (Hot Stone Pot) which was very well presented. There were a lot of vegetables and the dish stayed hot but my biggest complaint was that there was barely any flavor in the beef or from the gochujang, which was very disappointing. We also got a bulgogi burger to split. It was defiantly a interesting dish as a fusion dish. Maybe I'm more used to bulgogi with rice, but it was definitely a unique taste with how sweet the bulgogi burger was. \n\nThe place wasn't too loud and had a TV which had a game on. There is a nice outdoor seating area for the spring/summer. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. The service was good and the food was more often good.

You can certainly get better Korean fried chicken. The Korean pickle in the bulgogi burger was a nice touch, but overall not mind blowing. Finished the meal with the misugaru cake with lemon cream and persimmon...and apparently the people here do not know what a ripe persimmon tastes like.\n\nThe highlight here was definitely the cocktail -- the P&P is a great rye whiskey drink that balances the bite and the sweet well. \n\nIf you have risk-averse diners, then this place would probably be a nice introduction to Korean flavors in a posh setting. But if you're a Korean food veteran, then look elsewhere to satisfy your cravings."

I came here on a Friday night with my boyfriends and was able to sit outside without a wait. To drink, I had the white sangria; a bit too sweet for my taste but good nonetheless. I probably wouldn't get it again because it wasn't cheap ($9). For an appetizer, we ordered the dumplings, which were delicious! The beef on the inside was so flavorful, I could have eaten 50 of them. There are five dumplings, so you can split them with another person as a small appetizer. For an entree, my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork sandwich. He wasn't crazy about the sandwich but we both loved his spicy fries. Very interesting addition. I got the bibimbap with beef. I loved it! My only qualm was that it came out cold. I asked for it to be heated up and they were happy to oblige, but it still came out lukewarm after that. I might try it in the stone pot next time. Otherwise, it was really flavorful with just a little kick which I loved. The service was also really good - our waitress was very attentive, friendly, and polite. I will say it is a little pricey, but not any more so than comparable restaurants in the area.

Wish we had a neighborhood place like this near us back home.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nKoreancini - fried rice balls with sweet corn and a fresh roasted tomato dipping sauce\n\nThe special pork buns with honey dipping sauce - soft pillowy buns and slow roasted pork with honey dipping sauce on the side (so filling!)\n\nChicken wings - sweet, salty, covered in sauce and messy gooey deliciousness (huge portion!)\n\nEntrees:\nTuna hwe dup bap - I had never had this before and it was refreshing, light and a delightful mix of crunchy light vegetable flavored, fresh tuna, sesame oil, rice and a bit of spicy sauce. Yum.\n\nBulgogi burger - whoa. Rich, buttery bun and perfectly toasted bread, umami salty sweet marinated patty, cucumber pickles and a huge heap of fries. Wow. \n\nDessert:\nThe little flour shortcakes with fresh cream and fresh strawberries and blueberries. We were so stuffed by this point but took this down as well.\n\nDrinks:\nWe had an amazing local vanilla ale (so refreshing), a beautiful porter, the old boy cocktail (yum!! spirit forward but still tempered by citrus), the p&p, and the Korumbian which had a lovely anise flavor and was not too sweet.\n\nWaters were always filled, service was attentive but not too much so and really really nice, atmosphere was hoppin on a Saturday night but not was not a pretentious crowd. Was a great neighborhood spot and perfectly chill vibe. Plus the chef was owning the kitchen with the open kitchen thing going on - always awesome to see.\n\nObviously by the end of the night, we had to slowly ROLL out of there we were so full. \n\nCan't wait to go back!"

The place is reasonably priced and the food is great--Korean comfort food. It's not good for you, but if you want that, go to a real Korean place and get something full of veggies. \n\nAt Southgate, get the quintuply fried wings (KFC) that are truly terrific in Korean hot sauce (gochujang). Pass on the pork belly buns--they are ok but nothing to Yelp\u00a9 about. The autumn salad was very nice, too.\n\nKorean tacos look like they're going to be a problem with the meat smothered in what appears to be a cream sauce of some sort, but actually the sauce is quite light and the tacos are terrific. For me the star was the Bulgogi burger, which I'm still thinking of weeks later... Not the right cuisine descriptor, but it's the most \"umami\" thing you'll ever eat. Spiced like bulgogi with the real deal trimmings and a great soft bun. Really fantastic and highly recommended. \n\nGo here and don't look back and enjoy.

They're somewhat pricey ($12 for 7 wings) but the wings are huge and meaty, so I usually only need 4-5 wings paired with some beer for a full meal. I loved both their flavors, but I'm slightly partial towards the soy garlic. Other items on the menu include a variety of Asian fusion dishes, but they seemed mediocre at best in my opinion. However, the service is excellent and meticulous (they gave us little wet wipes because the wings can be messy on the fingers) and the ambiance is upbeat and modern. Also, I tried one of their specialty cocktails, which was delicious, and I'd love to try more of them! As such, I'd definitely come back regularly for the wings and the drinks. \n\nAnd so, yes Yelp - \"Yay! I'm a fan\""

When we arrived at the restaurant at 6 p.m. for our reservation, I asked for a table as far away from the table as possible, as it was bitterly cold outside.  There was only one other table of four in the restaurant at the time.  The hostess said that she had set up the table closest to the door for us (which only involved pushing two tables together), and even though the restaurant was otherwise empty excepting the one table, she insisted that we could take the table closest to the door or sit at the common table in the back.  So we sat at the common table.  We were there for a couple of hours and many of the other tables were empty much of the time we were there.  I give the hostess a HUGE thumbs down!  However, I must say that this was our second time eating at Southgate and we were otherwise very happy with both the food and the service.

I am so happy we went with his recommendation! As Natalie K. said in her review, (she is the friend I was with) we were told that the crunch of the rice you get with this dish is incomparable, and it is so true.  It tied the whole thing together.  I could not get enough!!! I am honestly salivating just thinking about it.

The waiter, which we had actually recognized from elsewhere was super attentive and helpful as well, he seemed to have that balance of not being pushy when it came to ordering and moving service along to being completely absent when we needed to request things.  The other owner guy (having recognized him from the philly.com article) also gave us an extra dessert which was a nice surprise after apologizing for long wait times (which for us we didn't even have to wait that long!) and that attention to small details let's me know they care about their business\n\nDrinks: I. Love. These. Drinks.  From the various cocktails I had gotten to sample from different friends there wasn't a single one I wouldn't order again for myself, and some of them had alcohols I didn't even like.\n\nFood: For dinner I got to try the wings, koreancini balls, pulled pork sandwich and the shortcake dessert.  First off, the wings are probably the best I've had in philly so far, the only thing that would prohibit me from ordering more is the price.  The koreancini balls to me were probably the most disappointing thing I ordered all night.  We had ordered on plate to split amongst our table, and the ball that I ended up with came to me unseasoned and bland, it tasted like fried fluff and by the time I got to my plate, there was no dipping sauce left on my plate because I ate with savages and the late bird gets nothing at that table.  My pulled pork sandwich came and I thought it was great, my only mistake was probably letting it sit while I waited for the rest of my table to get their orders.  In that time I guess the juices of the pork and slaw soaked into the bottom of the bun a bit, making me wish that that bun was toasted on a flat top for a bit +/- a tiny bit of butter.  I also REALLY LOVED THE FRIES. I could eat buckets of that stuff.  My only wish was that it had some sauce to dip it in, because naturally fries are the perfect vessels for sauce delivery and it felt weird not having any.  So, we asked the server and he offered us some of the sriracha ketchup that came on other things, and it was AMAZING!  Ideally if there was a combo meal where I could get wings and a plate of fries and a beer for ~$12-15, I'd be back at least once a week if not more.  Finally the dessert was a very fresh and clean finish.  I don't particularly care for the super sweet desserts of this world, and this was the perfect balance for me where it was just sweet enough for me to want more.\n\nOverall for a soft opening this was a strong showing.  Service is right where it should be and I'm sure most of the food kinks will be worked out over time.  And I can definitely see this place becoming a local watering hole soon!  I'll be back."

The soy/garlic and spicy sauces were delicious. We both ordered clay pot rice dishes- one beef and one tofu, with a side of kimchi. The kitchen does not skimp on ingredients - these dishes were chock full of assorted vegetables, protein and fried egg on top. They came to the table sizzling. Washed them down with cold beers on tap- delicious meal on  a cold night.\nWe will be back."

Just serve the hot pot and save me the couple dollar surcharge. Also extra for the beef. A 12 dollar bowl turns into a 17 dollar bowl. Portions on the light side - hot pot is huge but barely even 3/4 full. Don't expect leftovers.\n\nOverall I love this place but I would extra love it if I left with some leftovers."

I'm giving 4 stars because we only had 4 dishes and I'll wait on a 5-star review until we've tasted more.\n\nTo start, we ordered the mandoo (panfried beef dumplings) and the sweet potato fritters. Both were served piping hot and were delicious, crispy and accompanied by nice sauces that complemented the dishes. We split the beef bibimbap (a bowl of rice, vegetables and seared beef strips) which we paid extra to have delivered in a hot bowl. It arrived sizzlingly hot and stayed that way in the cool evening breeze for the entire time we took to eat it. The beef was flavorful and the dish was nicely balanced. The fried egg on top was a lovely touch.\n\nWe also split dessert, which was butterscotch pot de creme topped with chunks of English toffee. I make pot de creme at home often, and we have had many iterations at various restaurants, so we are familiar with what very good quality pot de creme is. This was one of the best we've ever had. The butterscotch custard was richly flavored, perfectly smooth, and pleasantly dense. The shards of English toffee on top were the absolute perfect complement to this delicious baked custard.\n\nWe left the restaurant completely satisfied, maybe a wee bit too full, but glad that we had eaten there. Oh, and grateful that we had to ride our bikes a mile or so home to work off at least a little of the meal.\n\n3 draft beers, 2 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 dessert: $50 + tip\n\nWe will return to this restaurant."

Decent flavoring.  Steamed buns were pretty bad.  No flavor at all.  The honey dipping sauce was an interesting complement, but it didn't really enhance the lack of flavor in the bun.

Maybe it was because of the Restaurant week menu or their adjustment to American cuisines but there were parts that were definitely a hit or miss.\nThere was nothing to complain about with the decor and service, the place was happening on a Friday night. The food though is a hit or miss.\nThe Korean Fried Chicken we got both spicy and non-spicy. Those were probably the biggest KFC wings I've ever had and the taste wasn't bad but why is the crust on it so thick? It was like eating Kentucky fried chicken crust with Korean sauce. It was unfortunately because the chicken and sauce was pretty good.\nAlso the sides of kimchi and daikon, the daikon was too sweet and too largely cut, but everything was okay. \nI ordered the bulgogi burger, which the fries weren't any special and that gochujang sauce is bleh I had to order a side of ketchup. Gochujang unsweet as dipping is a terrible idea for fries! \n\nAnyway you may be think I hated the food at this point. On the contrary the bulgogi burger was actually really good! I can't help but wonder why nobody has ever thought of such a thing so props.\nLastly the matcha creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was the creme de la creme, it was absolutely amazing! I wish we could've just ate a larger bowl of that and a bibimbap and i would've been more than happy. Unfortunately It's a toss up of giving it another shot or not, maybe just one more bite of that matcha creme brulee!"

        "text": "I will be the first to admit I don't know much about Korean food, but I'd like to think I know something about GOOD food, and this is it!\n\nWe waited a month to check South Gate out because, invariably, a brand new place has kinks to work out, so I'd rather wait until they are. With that in mind, if they had any kinks to begin with, they've been dealt with. From decor to ambiance to service to menu selection to quality of food and beauty in its plating, I think South Gate pretty much nailed it.\n\nWe arrived before any other diners, (because that's what you do when you have a baby with you!) and were seated with high chair and sippy cup of water for baby. The place is beautiful. Sleek yet inviting decor. Fresh flowers. \n\nUnusually for me, I wasn't super hungry but we wanted to try a bunch of things.\n\nWe wet our whistles with a few beers. I got a delicious and heady vanilla porter. I think my husband got a sour ale...Not sure, but we were both happy. These were big pours for the price. If you're one who likes to dine at the bar, this one is aesthetically pleasing and well stocked.\n\nFor apps, Koreancini rice balls and sweet potato fritters. Both fried, neither greasy, but instead light, crispy and delicious. The Koreancini was accompanied by a mild but flavorful roasted cherry tomato dipping sauce. The fritters were complemented by a tangy chili sauce. \n\nFor entrees,my hubby got the wings (even though it's a starter, it is a LARGE portion), as they are always his favorite, and consequently, what he's most critical about. I asked how they were. \"Great\" he said, through a full mouth which loosely translates into, \"These are really effing good.\" I didn't try them, but I would take his word for it.\n\nWe tried both the beef and tuna rice bowls. The tuna hwe dup bap was fresh, crispy, not too salty with just enough asian flair to compete with the best tuna tartare I've had.\n\n The beef bibimbap? Well, if I'm being truthful without reservation, this was the best dish of anything I've had in a long time. I could eat this every day for the rest of my life and want for nothing more. Honestly. I plan to return here at least once a week (ok, maybe just once a month) just for this dish. I didn't get the hot bowl because my long-armed baby may have burned herself. But the beautiful fried egg atop a mountain of fresh, lightly cooked vegetables and perfectly seasoned and tender beef, sticky rice, sauce....oh my god... The best.\n\nAt the end of that I can't believe I challenged my stomach to take in more, but I managed to scarf down half the shortcake dessert. Now, fruit in my dessert is not typically my thing, but this offered a fresh approach to an old standby. From what I understand, there was a ground powder popular in Korea worked into the cake batter. It lent a spicy and unusually pleasant flavor I've never tasted before. So if fruity desserts aren't your thing either, give this one a chance!\n\nFor those reviewers who complaining about price, I'm honestly confused. I paid only slightly less for lunch at Stella Pizzeria last week and was left hungry and disappointed. The prices at South Gate are more than appropriate: you are getting quality, portion size and finesse. Just because it's labelled \"gastropub\" doesn't mean you should expect to pay for average bar food. This is GOOD food. I've certainly paid much more in fancier restaurants and got far less.\n\nWith one meal, this has become my new fav."

The drinks are watered down and taste like juice and the bibimbap and the chicken katsu are totally forgettable. Indoor seating is so loud that you leave hoarse- sitting outside is a much more pleasant experience (though my chair was right next to the bussing station). Beyond this, we had a party of 5 and were charged a 20% gratuity automatically included in the bill which was calculated on top of tax. I'm all for tipping waiters, but it should be calculated on your meal not on state tax. \nSo basically if you really can't find anywhere else to get fried chicken, go here and be prepared for mad food coma. Otherwise, I'd advise you checking out somewhere else."

However, we were disappointed as soon as the drinks arrived. Tiny portions with not so tiny prices - be prepared to shell out some money to walk away full. \n\nFood/Drinks:\n- Spicy Pulled Pork Sandwich ($13)\n  The flavor of the pulled pork was just like any other, and the small portion size did not help. The only part of the meal that our entire group enjoyed were the gochugaru fries. Advertised as \"house fries\" that come with any sandwich, it came out as fries sprinkled with chili pepper and gochujang ketchup. \n- Korean BBQ Beef Tacos ($14)\n  So. Small. As soon as the plate was set in front of me, I already knew it was going to be a ramen night after I got home. The three tiny tacos had pretty good flavor, but were so small and lacking in the filling. (Heads up for cilantro-haters; ask for them to take it out if you're cilantro-averse!)\n- Korombian Sake Punch ($10)\n  Tasted a little watered down, and was very small for the price. All of the delicious aspects of the drink that were advertised (honey, lemon, citron tea, Korean melon, pomegranate juice) were nowhere to be found.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Quick seating if you arrive early\n- Not too loud, which was surprising; you can definitely hear one another if you're with a small group\n- There's outdoor seating, which is sure to be enticing on a nice summer night\n- Our waitress was a little bit on the slower side and looked flustered most of the night, but it also was the first official opening night of the pub\n\nOverall:\nI think I'll give it one more try (maybe with the wings and koreancini), but my hopes for any good quality korean or korean-fusion food are certainly dashed for the Center City area."

It was actually difficult to bite through - maybe it was an off night? The flavor was pretty good, but not outstanding, and at $12/7pc, they were a bit pricey.The octopus was absolutely amazing. I'd go back just for that. For mains, I got the bulgogi burger - the beef was tender and perfectly marinated and the (housemade!) pickles were refreshingly tangy. The fries had a great spicy kick as well.\n\nTheir drink selection is solid - a decent beer list and interesting cocktails.

When we've gone in the past for dinner you can't really go wrong, but my favorites are the bonchon chicken wings (obviously) and dolsat bibimbap. \n\nThe drinks are amazing as well. I always get the \"old boy\". It's like and old fashioned and a negroni had a baby. Last pro tip is the chef's table is great for large groups of 6-10."

The Green Tea Waffles, however, were delicious, gave a hint of green tea flavoring while not being too overpoweringly sweet with a nice spongy consistency I'd expect from a nicely made belgian waffle.\n\nThe second item I ordered was the Kimchi Poutine [$12]:\nThey bring this out in a hot stone pot like you would see for Bimbimbap at many Korean restaurants and you can literally hear the sizzling tastiness approaching.  The kimchi, cheese, bacon, fries and runny egg on top was such a sinful combo.  You can pull the cheese up with your fork and it just oozes up.  Once you get to the bottom of the pot, the fries are extra crunchy from the stone pot.  \n\nAll in all, Southgate is a nice brunch spot with some pretty unique fusion dishes."

The restaurant was not crowded at all on this particular night and they made sure to set a table for six prior to our arrival. The place itself is rather small, with a long bar running down one side and a row of tables along the opposite wall. There was a pretty narrow path between the two. This did make it a bit squishy for those of us with our backs to the people at the bar and awkward for others to walk in between. \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful with the eclectic menu. We opted to eat family style, with food delivered as it was prepared. We started with the korean fried chicken, one spicy and one soy garlic. These are essentially amazing chicken wings. I say go for the spicy - it was super flavorful and not all that spicy. My personal favorite were the short rib ho-ppang. The buns were fresh and delicious and the pork was seasoned absolutely perfectly. We then had the beef dolsot bibimbap - ours was not served sizzling as described, but was very tasty all the same. Finally, we had the japchae which was probably my second favorite. \n\nOverall, this was a great group experience. We loved the food and option to eat family style. I'll definitely return for more of those pork buns and other deliciousness in the future!"

Found this place a few steps away. Went there! \n\nFriendly and local vibe, vibrantly noisy, but not anywhere near so much that conversation is difficult. A small coterie of tables inside - be sure to reserve before you go. We didn't, but found a spot at the bar. Bartenders were helpful and nice. \n\nThe menu is short, but you'll still have a hard time choosing. Fortunately, the young woman next to us got the hot pot. It sizzled hotly, scents and spices urging us to order the same. \n\nSo we did. My wife got beef, I got tofu dolsot bibimbap. We tied for best dinner. No, seriously. The tofu was perfectly prepared, with a crisp just slightly chewy crust, yummily seasoned by its veggie environment topped off with a tingly red sauce. Get that. \n\nA small but tasty selection of beers and such went nicely with dinner. We could have stayed for another, sitting and yakking in the midst of other couples and friends enjoying the company and atmosphere, but we had pie to eat. Head to Magpie a couple of blocks away for dessert. \n\nSouthgate is great. Go there."

Perhaps it was because of the high expectations (particularly about their wings), but the food did not really wow me.  As a starter, we shared their highly praised KFC (Korean fried chicken) wings - half soy garlic and half spicy gochujang. It came out hot and crispy (and was really big!).  As a spicy-food-fanatic, I was surprised that I preferred the soy garlic. It had a more memorable flavor profile, while the gochujang was just plain spiciness (could use some citrus seasoning, for example). While I loved how crispy and juicy the wings were, the flavors didn't really seep into the actually chicken, so unless you're eating the flour crust/skin, there wasn't much flavor.\n\nI ordered the marinated beef bibimbop (without the stone pot - I think it's rather ridiculous to pay $2 just based on the bowl that your food is served in!), and was rather disappointed.  While the flavors were good, it came out cold, the egg on top was overcooked, and the beef was rather tough. I really wanted to like Southgate, especially since there aren't many Korean restaurants in the area; however, I don't think I'll go back for a while. And if I were to go back, it would be for the ambience and I would not be getting the same dishes again."

Service here is good - wait staff is attentive and brought us a whole container of water for the table. The menu for brunch isn't huge, but gives a decent amount of options that are twists on some Korean classics. The menu is easily accessible on their website. I ordered the dolsot bibimbap while my friend got short rib loco moco. I loved my dish! I ate almost all of it - the one downfall, which was not Southgate's fault, was that the gochujang in the dish was a little too spicy for me. I would order this dish again in a heartbeat and just ask them to leave the gochujang off. My friend also said his meal was delicious and ate the whole bowl.

The star dishes of the night were really the dukbokki and pork belly ssam. WOW, this was probably the best dukbokki dish I've had in a while, and I'd definitely order it again. The pork belly ssam was also really delicious and different (since I usually order the seafood one and hadn't seen pork belly as an option anywhere else before). \n\nWe also ordered the grapefruit soju, which was good, but not my favorite soju flavor. I kinda wish they had lychee soju, but they had a lot of other different soju flavors compared to your traditional Korea-town restaurants. \n\nOverall, I'm glad Philly finally has a little more upscale Korean option, and I really like the atmosphere and vibe of Southgate."

I would have loved some heat or punch of flavor.\n\nI got the tofu bibimbap which was AWESOME. Really fresh and a sizable portion. To drink I had the sake punch, which was light and refreshing. We also had the dessert -- their only dessert option at the moment -- shortcake layered with whipped cream and berries. The dessert was good, not particularly sweet, which I enjoyed, but, again, nothing read Korean. To top it all off, service was truly excellent. \n\nI can't really understand the reviews complaining about price. They might seem high if this was still Tangier, but for a Gastropub they were pretty average. \n\nAll in all, Southgate has some room to grow -- first and foremost they need to put their menu up on the website.

Based on first impressions, I'd give this place 3.5 stars for now."

Philly suffers from a shortage of decent Korean food - this place has pretty good bibimbap and the fusion dishes are perfect for those who aren't familiar with the cuisine. Enjoyed the beer selection as well.\n\nBig shout out to the team here for being willing to track down a lost receipt for me. Huge, huge, kudos for something that they didn't have to do for me, and really appreciated. Thanks!"

There were a few highlights including a delicious calamari salad, but there were more misses than hits including a Korean fried chicken sandwich in which the overly breaded and generous chicken pieces were completely dried out.  The shrimp dumplings were also a disaster, offering four small dumplings with so little filling they tasted like plain dough swimming in a sauce.  The short-rib filled steamed buns were a reasonable take on the original though they were, like the originals, too doughy.  (That was OUR mistake).  In sum, there were some interesting flavors ruined by some poor preparations.\n\nLet's hope the entire small plate shtick runs its course soon.  It won't, of course, because it is so profitable, but it isn't generally a satisfying way to order...or eat!!!"

We tried both styles of their Korean Fried Chicken (KFC) - the soy garlic and spicy gochujang. I really enjoyed both flavors. The spicy wasn't TOO spicy and the soy garlic was sweet and tangy. Both were a great compliment to the extra crispy crust on the chicken. For my entr\u00e9e I went with the beef bibimbap and of course upgraded to the dolsot option ($2) extra which was worth getting the hot crispy rice. I ate the whole bowl and I'm not even mad. I tried 2 of their signature cocktails the \"Korumbian\" because the name just made me laugh and the Korea 75. The Korumbian was a little too sweet for my taste, but it was nice with the spicy wings and salty soy flavors of the dishes we got. I preferred the Korea 75 which is sparking wine with sake and a little citrus (grapefruit maybe?) I'm a sucker for anything with a little sparkle to it. I definitely would recommend this place for something that isn't your typical Italian or Chinese casual dining if you like interesting flavors. I will be back!"

The restaurant was modern and comfortable, perfect for a holiday season dinner with friends. \n\nWe started with sake and Sapporo beer, and I ordered the fried chicken and the dolsot (hot stone bowl) bibimbap. The fried chicken tasted good, but was a tiny bit heavy on batter, and was expensive at $12 for 6 wings. Similarly, the bibimbap rice and veggies were done perfectly and tasted wonderful, but the beef was slightly overcooked and chewy.\n\nOverall, we had a good experience and would be happy to return for round two.\n\nFour Yelp stars"

Ambience is chill and I think they have a good sense of who they are in terms of preserving the essence of Korean food while stretching the boundaries, but not by too much.  Service is always friendly. As for the food -- KFC is the best item on the menu -- very thick and very crunchy batter -- and both spicy and soy are great.  Katsu burger with kkochukaru fries -- the kids really liked the flavor profile.  The short rib loco moco -- a nice nod to Hawaiian good -- adventurous, although I would still opt for the KFC.  As for the kimchee -- it was good -- just nothing that extraordinary for kimchee.  Philly could use more Korean style joints like this, so I hope it does well.  It would be a fun place to host a private party."

I went opening weekend with a group of 14 people and had a really awesome experience! We didn't think to make a reservation, but the hostess was kind enough to seat us right away at the chef's table right by the kitchen. The server was also very attentive and patient, considering people in our party were walking in sporadically every 10 minutes or so. For food we ordered the soy ginger korean fried chicken (7 pcs/order) and koreancini balls (5 pcs/order) to share, and I got the bulgogi burger as my main. The meat was a little dry and the side of gochugaru fries could definitely use a lot more seasoning to really POP, but still a solid meal. They also gave us an extra dessert (misugaru cake with berries and creme) on the house for the delayed service, which most of us didn't even notice! \n\nI came back the Friday after with a friend, again without a reservation, and got a nice outdoor table right away. We ordered the sake punch and the koreana 76 off the cocktail menu and they were both delicious and super refreshing! We tried the KFC again, this time half sweet and half spicy, and I actually preferred the gochujang flavor - it's not too spicy and just sweet enough. For our mains we ordered the bibimbap and the pulled pork burger, which were both stellar. I actually enjoyed the pork burger much more than the bulgogi burger from my previous visit. The fries were crispy and cooked to perfection, and the ketchup/gochujang mixed condiment for dipping was a really great touch to the dish.\n\nDefinitely a fan of this place and will be coming back often! It is a little pricy for everyday eating  and it's not necessarily authentic korean food, but nevertheless a great addition to the food scene in philly!"

On a rainy Sunday I figured brunch was the perfect excuse to stop in. The space it fairly small with a long bar and about 6 or 7 tables. Great for groups of 2-6 although I did see a larger group in the back. The decor is dark and reminiscent of a pub/Korean soju bar. The brunch menu is concise with a good selection of dishes to choose from. We got the chicken and waffles, short rib loco moco, and deviled eggs. \n\nChicken and waffles was a hit. The chicken was flavorful with a crispy cracklin skin. A spicy maple syrup or honey drizzle would have been a great addition but then you run the risk of soggy chicken. And no one likes soggy fried chicken. The matcha waffles were dense and crisp and a good compliment to the chicken.\n\nMy short rib loco moco was hearty and rich. You get a generous portion of soft short rib. The rice and pickled jalapenos were a nice offset to the rich egg and meat. \n\nWe were intrigued by the deviled eggs and they were a fun spin on the party classic. The kimchi's funkiness cut through the creamy yolks and the whites were soft boiled.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan of Southgate. It's a great place to take friends for dinner, drinks, brunch, pretty much any occasion."

They have excellent outdoor seating as well as a warm, chic interior, and all the dishes (especially the pork ssam and pajeon, as well as the rotating burgers and chicken sandwich - oh, and the brunch!) are reliably delicious. The service is friendly, prompt, and never overbearing. \n\nMy only critique is that they do struggle sometimes to meet demand during restaurant weeks and after street fairs on South St, so I suspect they need more service on hand for surge capacity - but they've always tried to make it right when wait times have been long.

The place looks good, service was fine ... but there was one other thing that I think is kind of annoying.  We arrived at 5:15 on a weekday.  Of course I know it's happy hour and I had checked that out beforehand online.  The hostess gave us only a regular drink menu and the waiter brought over only a regular food menu.  I had to ask for the Happy Hour menu....and when I did I got a response, \"Oh do you want a Happy Hour menu?\"  C'mon - if you have Happy Hour specials just give out the menu and don't make people have to specifically ask for it or otherwise miss out on the special offers.

I wouldn't recommend ordering this, especially since it's $2/piece.\n\nFries (not on the menu - $4)\nThe fries were unexpectedly seasoned (a little too much IMO, it got way too salty for me) -- I'm not sure what's in their seasoning because you can see red flakes on the fries, but I didn't find them spicy. \n\nBeef Dolsot Bibimbap ($17)\nThis was my favorite dish of the night. I loved the beef -- it wasn't chewy at all and I think they marinated it. Plus, you can't really go wrong with a dolsot bibimbap.

Looking at the menu and reading the review, I was ready to give it a try. It's just... the execution of their ideas fell short. \n\nWe tried the Korean tacos and the kimchi poutine. I think the ideas were great for both dishes. But the bulgogi in taco was dry and overcooked, perhaps because the cut was too thick and had too high of a meat-to-veggie ratio. Based on what I grew up eating, bulgogi is supposed to be thinly sliced, tender, juicy, and have all flavor marinated from onion and pear. Their green sauce thing was also a bit off. \n\nKimchi in the kimchi poutine was surprisingly good. The combination of kimchi, egg, and cheese is hard to fail when your kimchi itself made well and cooked perfectly. Kudos to Southgate for that part. I think the idea of kimchi poutine is interesting and has a potential work, but their fries were way too oily.\n\nI think both dishes might work if you walk into this place expecting a greasy bar food with Korean influence. I don't know what the culinary training background of the chef here is, but his/her ideas are great, just needs a better execution. I really want this place to do well and get better.\n\nTheir service was amazing by the way - our server was David according to the receipt, who was extremely attentive (he must have poured water for us 17 times) and made thoughtful recommendations.\n\nDrink selection isn't long but decent.

I went back to Southgate and was pleasantly surprised to see an updated happy hour menu with lots of yummy food and drink options!! Not pictured is their happy hour cocktail which I had 2 of because it was so good. This time I tried the crispy brussels, bao buns, and korean spicy wings. I am being completely honest and not overblown when I say that I've never had better brussels sprouts in my life -- crispy but soft, hearty but balanced, creative in its flavors, and so warm. Seriously one of the best things I've had in Philadelphia so far. Bao buns and Korean spicy wings are also decent, but these brussels sprouts were truly one of the best dishes I've had. Also, much appreciated to the staff for being so receptive with feedback and also for their service, which is a standout as always!\n\nI'll be back :) You have a loyal customer in me!"

A sleek and minimal feel for the space makes the tiny tables in the bar area feel less cramped than they actually are. There is a communal table in the back (near the open kitchen) that would benefit larger groups and the bathroom is downstairs.\n\nAs everyone else has mentioned, you ought to get the wings. Don't afraid of the hot wings--they are not so hot as to make you tear up and pack a more flavorful punch than the sweet wings. No matter the flavor, you are in for an ample, crunchy portion. The kale salad was the perfect size for two to share as a starter, and the mashed avocado made the dish. The buns were light and sweet and were a good addition as a starter to our meal. But what really stole the show was the dessert (check the specials board). We had a caramel pot de creme with peanut brittle and dark chocolate on top... I can still taste it melting in my mouth. \n\nService was fantastic and felt more upscale than the title \"gastropub\" would suggest. All of the servers I've had are knowledgeable about the drinks menu. I don't remember which of the signature cocktails I had, but it was whiskey-based, strong, and reminiscent of an old-fashioned--in a word, delicious.\n\nAn excellent place to come with friends for drinks and small plates--I'm sure I will be back again soon."

I've passed by it so many times and was always struck by the simplicity of their menu + how warm and inviting the outdoor space was, and this week I bit the bullet and went for happy hour.\n\n1) SERVICE: Great. Our waiter was impressively attentive to our table even though it was a busy night with full tables and a line for takeout. I remember barely finishing my water when he magically appeared to refill my cup. They also took precautions by wearing masks, using paper menus, and wiping down tables. \n\n2) FOOD: I had the happy hour burger of the day (kimchi burger) and southgate fries (garlic, gochugaru, gochujang aioli) to share. At first I thought I was saving a lot more, but it seems like their $16 regular menu burger includes fries whereas the $10 happy hour burger doesn't. From a happy hour perspective, you save $2 on banchan and $2 if you order the burger and fries separately. I didn't really get why the $4 mystery beer was in the happy hour menu since it's also $4 in their regular drink menu. Anyway, the food was solid. I'd describe it as Korean-American grub with a contemporary twist. The southgate fries were my favorite -- they had that honey garlicky smell that I love and there was more than enough for 2 to share. The burger was also well portioned, and I think people will appreciate the fusion element with the kimchi. However I wish there was more flavor from the patty or the cheese, since it seemed like the kimchi was the unilateral star of the show. \n\nOverall this was a great experience and I will be back to try other things on the menu. The pricing of the happy hour menu could be a little more transparent, and some of the menu does seem a little pricy, but it's a cozy place with attentive service and a no frills menu of creative but instantly recognizable food that packs a punch."

As a Korean-American who has grown up with home-cooked Korean meals, I have high standards.\n\nThe first thing that really disappointed me is that the kimchi was not free. All the banchan style dishes that would normally be free at a Korean restaurant were labeled as appetizers that you would had to pay for. The analogy I would make to this offense would be an Italian restaurant making you pay for bread. \n\nI ordered the jajangmyeon, which I was surprised and impressed that they offered for a fusion restaurant. The components of the sauce looked pretty traditional and authentic, but I would not say it was exceptionally delicious. It was okay. It was fine. It was also nearly $20 so that was slightly upsetting to know I was paying $20 for a specialty jajangmyeon, which is considered a take-out/fast food in Korea. \n\nMy friends got the bimbimbap, which looked pretty good, but the bimbimbap was also at mid-price range, and I feel you could get a bimbimbap dish of similar standard at a lower-priced location. \n\nIn terms of ambiance and restaurant atmosphere, it was small but cozy.

I'd had Southgate in my bookmarks for months, so I decided to snag up a last minute reservation and see what all the buzz was about. I was not disappointed. \n\nWe arrived ten minutes early and our table wasn't ready yet. There was room to sit by the railing near the back which I was grateful for because it was really cold outside. I ordered the persimmon soju ($16) It came in a ceramic container with two little cups. The persimmon flavor was readily apparent, the drink was only slightly sweet which I liked. \n\nWe were seated about five minutes after our reservation time. We ordered the banchan which was brussel sprouts and pickled radishes that night. The radishes were good, but they were American style radishes. \n\nWe ordered a few more small plates to share. The star of the show was the octopus. The pieces were a little crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on the inside with a creamy savory sesame sauce and spicy pineapple kimchi to give the perfect balance of heat and sweetness. I think this might be the best octopus dish I have ever eaten anywhere! \n\nThe Korean fried chicken was crispy outside and juicy inside. We got one order of spicy and one order of sweet. The chicken was good, but I prefer crispier skin in favor of crispy batter. This style was the later. The spicy was pretty weak in terms of heat, which was kind of surprising after the octopus. Don't get me wrong, it was really good, but my personal preference for KFC leans more towards what you get at Cafe Soho with the light batter and crispy skin. However, I loved the spicy Korean fries at Southgate! They were fresh and crispy with some heat from the dried peppers. \n\nI ordered another cocktail that was the special with apple brandy and an egg white and pepper. It was really well balanced. \n\nThe only disappointment that night was dessert. We got a meringue one. It was just the hardened meringue cookies you can buy in a plastic tub at the grocery store with some jam on it. Too sweet and not very satisfying. \n\nOverall, it was a very pleasant experience. Service was friendly and prompt. It was a little pricey, but since it was tasty, I didn't mind so much. I plan to return soon!"

When you walk in, the spot is quaint and trendy - it  makes for a really nice date spot! The space is small, but it's not overly quiet with everyone that's in there. There's a bar with ample seating in this space, that actually happens to take up a lot of space - however, it makes the table seating much cozier. \n\nFOOD: \nKorean Fried Chicken in spicy sauce - this was amazing! I definitely recommend this. Somehow they make the skin extra crispy, like it's almost floating on top of the chicken underneath. I know that makes no sense, but when you get it you will love it. \nBeet salad - this was good. I think I would have enjoyed it more if I could have eaten the bacon that came with it. I tried a little of the vinegarette to see what I was missing and I was definitely missing a lot. \nDolsot Bimbimbap - THIS WAS GREAT! It was a rainy and cold day when we ate; the mood was somber, but this dish just warmed us both up right away! It was delicious, when we asked our waiter if it's worth it to get the sizzling dish, he said the crunch of the rice that you get with this dish is uncomparable and he wasn't lying. It was truly delicious and the crunch of the rice tied all of it together. \nBurger - our waiter told us this was voted best burger in Philly and after eating it, I one-hundo p agree. This is an amazing burger and the fries that came with it were perfect. \n\nI really wish we had had room for dessert, but it was just not happening. Oh well, guess I'll have to come back and try more! The menu is awesome, so I'd definitely come back to try something new!"

We had made a reservation and were seated right away in a crowded, cozy restaurant. There's bar seating as well as a collection of two-tops that can be pushed together as appropriate, but we wound up in the back at a large table that can seat about 10 people, so we shared our space with another group (shout out to the man next to me that night who now probably knows way more than he cared to know about my friends and me). \n\nThe drink list includes a variety of unique cocktails with an Asian spin. I decided to be adventurous and tried the featured Soju flight, which was pretty good --- I particularly enjoyed the soju with cardamom. My friends tried the Seoul Sour (which was \"more sour\" than my friend expected) and the White Sangria, which was good.\n\nFor our meal, we opted to split several of the small plates. The crispy tofu banchan had a great texture and a delicious sauce, while the eggplant was just okay. We got the Korean Fried Chicken with a mix of soy and spicy sauces, and it was incredible (thanks for the tip, Yelp!). The short-rib steam buns were delicious, and the waiter was nice enough to offer to bring a 3rd bun since the order typically comes with 2. The bassam (pork belly lettuce wraps) were flavorful with fresh lettuce and delicious pickled veggies, and the seafood pajeon pancake was enjoyable as well. My friend who has spent time in Korea overall pointed out that the food was based on traditional foods, but definitely had a unique spin --- but we definitely enjoyed our meal. \n\nI'd definitely love to go back; some of the entrees (including bibimbap and the bulgogi burger) were calling my name."

The inside was dark, cozy, and intimate, with many small tables lined up side by side parallel to the bar and an elevated communal table at the back of the restaurant for large groups of friends. The overall atmosphere was relaxed and casual. The food was amazing. \n\nMy friend and I started our meal with the octopus dduk kochi. It was $14 for 3 skewers so a little on the pricey side, but the skewers were worth it. The combination of fatty pork belly, chewy dduk, and perfectly grilled octopus drizzled with a sweet, but savory sauce was delicious. We then tried the dolsot bibimbap, almost like a Korean fried rice/salad, which was also very good. Though the size of the bibimbap was more than adequate, we were still hungry and so ordered the kimchi fries. Oh my god- they were everything you'd want with loaded fries. The fries were crisped to perfection and topped with a combination of kimchi, bacon, onions, cheese, and scallions. What impressed me the most about the dish was that the \"toppings\" were spread throughout the dish! Every fry was coated with flavor and we never ran out of the topping. It was the best spin on poutine I've ever had. All in all, a phenomenal dining experience and one I'll be hitting up again soon hopefully."

We were promptly seated and ordered our food since we were starving.\nIt was the tail end of happy hour so I also ordered the soju punch before it ended. I didn't care for the drink I got but drank it since it was only 8$. For food I started with the soy fried chicken appetizer. Then for my entree I got the bulgogi burger with fries.\nThe appetizer came out and omg there was so much chicken. It was all crispy and juicy! The sauce was really good too :) My bulgogi burger came out and it was pretty messy to eat but had a good bulgogi burger. It was slightly overcooked but other than that it was still really good. They give you a mountain of fries with the burger which is great! My friends got the tofu bibimbaps (vegan and vegetarian friendly!) And my other friend got the spice pork baos and the seoul hot chicken sandwich. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we were happily full. I had tons of leftovers after  :) great place! Can't wait to come back and try more items."

Our server was the right amount of attentive and the aesthetic of the restaurant was Instagram worthy.\n\nWe ordered the korean fried chicken and waffle and the short rib loco moco. Both of them were really good and a nice break from your typical brunch options. The korean fried chicken was served with green tea waffles which were the perfect balance of macha and waffle without being overwhelming. The short rib was super tender and melts in your mouth. \n\nI recommend this place for people who love brunch but want something a little different. Southgate does a great job of combining brunch with Korean flavors!"

        "text": "This is a super cute restaurant in Rittenhouse square! The food is Korean with a tapas twist to it. The menu looked amazing so we got a few items to share among 3 people: \"KFC\" (Korean fried chicken ), lamb steamed buns, bibimbap - hot stone and a side of the Brussel sprouts. The fried chicken was to die for - absolutely cooked and seasoned to perfection. That was definitely the table favorite. The second favorite was the dolsot bibimbap - which came in a sizzling hot stone and sauce on the side to stir in as your food cooks in front of you. Note the sauce is a little spicy so if you have zero tolerance for spicy food like I do consider opting out. It was still perfect without the sauce.  The lamb buns I was not a huge fan of only because they were really spicy and I did not have any warning before I ate them. Again if that's your thing go ahead and order it! Overall the food, service and ambiance was great - definitely go check it out."

We started with the KFC wings after reading such great reviews and they definitely lived up to the hype. We had the spicy and they were not overwhelmingly spicy at all just full of flavor and a crunch like I've never seen on a wing. Next, we had the beef tartar and it was incredible! The sauce was perfect and the quality of the beef tasted like a top steakhouse. Finished up with the korean steak tacos and they were even better than everything else! The marinade on the steak made it melt in your mouth and the garnishes were refreshing and not overwhelming. \n\nService was great with very friendly hosts and waitstaff. We missed happy hour but will definitely be back next time!"

He couldn't put his finger on what made it taste so good, but he loved it. Much of our meal was like this. Dish after dish, we were pleasantly caught off guard by the unusual flavor profiles. I would recommend the fried chicken appetizer, the bulgogi burger, the tuna hwe, the pork buns, and the misugaru shortcake for dessert. The sake punch was great too. We left stuffed and happy. It was truly a great meal. I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the menu."

        "text": "I was excited to try Southgate since there aren't many Korean places in Philly, but I would say it was just okay overall. We shared the steamed buns and each got our own Bibimbop, the one that comes in a hot stone bowl. It was the perfect amount of food, the combination of veggies in the Bibimbop was great, and it was nice a warm for a rainy night. However, the steamed buns were not what we expected, as they barely had any filling and the sauce was too salty. The Bibimbop could have also had much more flavor, and even though it was served in a hot stone bowl the rice never got a little crispy, which is one of my favorite parts of this dish. \nThe service was also just okay. Our server poured water so that it splashed constantly, and when clearing out other drink glasses spilled water on the table and didn't seem to notice. The hostess also made everyone leave their umbrellas at the front of the restaurant, which is reasonable, but when I went to leave my umbrella was gone, and the hostess was ambivalent at best. \nOverall, the food was okay, and the service was just okay, so for the price I most likely will not be returning."

I ordered the bulgogi burger and Korean fried chicken (KFC). Both arrived in the same delicious condition as they are in the restaurant. \n\nThere is no burger in the city quite like the bulgogi burger. It's a juicy burger that seems to be infused with the bulgogi seasoning, whatever that is. It has pickles on top and some kind of mayo on a sesame seed bun. The flavor profile of this burger is unlike anything else in the city. I love it!\n\nThe KFC wings are so crispy and so delicious. You can get them with mild or hot. I go with mild. You can't eat just one. Once you get started you will have to clean the plate. I actually got two orders of wings to share with my girlfriend. I knew one would not be enough.\n\nOn my previous visits I've tried the korean tacos, dumplings, and fries. I remember enjoying every dish, but the burger and KFC stand out. The waitstaff has always been friendly as well.\n\nThis review is long overdue. Southgate has been a 5 star restaurant since it opened and I'm glad I can order their food during this pandemic."

I wish they had an option for a more basic fry hint hint SOUTHGATE please add this option to your menu ; )\n\nLastly, I ordered the crisy tofu side item for $4.

The portion size was large, presentation colorful, and absolutely delicious. \n\nService was a bit lacking, but could be due to how busy they were.

The best thing we had by far were the southgate fries. They were coated in a spicy sauce and came with a spicy aioli on the side. We also got the wings which I felt left a bit to be desired. They were definitely crispy but the flavor was mostly soy and not very spicy even though we ordered the spicy ones (so I actually think they got our order wrong looking through other people's pictures if the wings on yelp). We also ordered the bao buns (pork and beef) on happy hour which were fine but not amazing. I think they needed more sauce or something to give it more flavor.\nReally the fries were the main selling point here.. torn between giving a 3 or a 4 for overall rating as we think it really was about a 3.5.

I would recommend one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert per person. \n\nThe potatoes were nice and soft. Slightly sweet and salty. The perfect way to start off the meal. \n\nThe Korean fried chick was good as well. We got half soy and half spicy. Nice a crispy and the meat was cooked all the way through. I wish there were more wings but oh well there are other places for that\n\nKimchi pancake was one of the best I have had. Small and savory. Perfect. \n\nThe beef in the jap chae was dry like beef jerky and also had no flavor at all. The other ingredients in the jap chae were tasty. Lots of veggies. It felt healthy to eat!\n\nThe peach panna cotta was light and squishy. Almost jello like consistency and the peaches ere sweet and the oatmeal/granola was nice a crunchy. \n\nThe black sesame cheesecake was single handily the worst dessert I have ever ordered. They must have forgotten to add sugar. It tasted like something I would spread on a bagel. Detestable. If I planned on ever coming back here I would have complained about this dish to my server.

I've only had the spicy korean wings but they were great. \n\nThe second visit with the group was underwhelming.

The chicken wings were crispy and seasoned really well. A great start to the meal. The bulgogi burger, on the other hand, probably could have done with a bit more marinade. It wasn't bad by any means, but it just tasted like a regular burger. I didn't get even a hint of the kind of Korean marinade you would associate with bulgogi. So, that was kind of disappointing. At least it was pretty big. Maybe it was because the chicken filled us up, but we were absolutely stuffed by the end of the meal - we probably should have just split a single order of the bulgogi burger with the sheer size of the burger and amount of fries.\n\nStill, it was a nice dining experience. It just wasn't particularly memorable. Well, except for the poor couple to the right of me. Better luck next time, fella."

Great food , great service, down to the choice of beverage. Ok so you might want to get ready to love thy neighbor while you're in Southgate. What I mean by that is, it is tight quarters, so get ready to see and smell what they ordered. Along with that you'll hear everyone's business , with it being small. \n\nI met up with some Yelpers that evening which is always a fun time, so we'll call it a mini UYE. The first thing that was mentioned was \"Get the Wings\"! Who am I to turn down wings, it'd be Un-American if I did. I am a wing fan, and I am telling you , these are some of the best wings to be had. Big meaty wings, that would make Popeye's, KFC,and Crown go back to their drawing board.  \n\n-Korean Fried Chicken~ A.K.A. \"KFC\" is what you'd say to your server, plus it even says is on their menu. Don't worry though, this isn't a Colonel Sanders recipe kiddies , so get ready to wipe your mouth. This is what you'd expect to bite into, now get ready for a crispy double fried wings with your choice of sauce. You can either go with their soy garlic or spicy gochujang, we  rocked out the gochujang as our option. UHHH-maze-ING\n\n-Mandoo~ I know everyone knows what a dumpling is, and I am sure we all are saying \"its a dumpling\" what is so special about it. My friends, I said the same thing until I tried it, and yes it is a dumpling. The Mandoo is a fried beef dumpling, over a creamy  eggplant type of puree. To simply put with one word, three syllables which is De-Lic-Ious... Delicious.\n\nThere is so much more that I wanted to peruse, like their Bulgogi burger and their Bibimbap where this also had my mouth watering.  So besides the food being awesome, their cocktails and craft selections are just as good. I really, and I mean I REALLY enjoyed their Southgate Citywide Special. A great concocted blend of Sapporo with a shot of Soju that will make you order one after another. Careful though, it maybe subtle, but this will come up on you like a freight train if you have to many.\n\nIn all the server was on the ball, the food is great, and the beverages are on point. What else could anyone ask for? Minus the size and the closeness of everyone, Southgate is a great spot to visit. I know I'll be back, get that KFC ready!"

It was super warm, snug, and loud, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. It took us time to decide what we wanted. I think the server maybe got distracted with other tables when we weren't ready right away. It all worked out in the end. \n\nDrinks: man from nowhere (server said this was the Staff favorite) - nice balance with a Smokey spice behind. Handmaiden - tartness up front. Both enjoyable. \n\nFood: Kimchi (exactly what you'd expect), KFC half and half (crispy coating. spicy is spicy! We both favored the soy and ginger), short rib steam buns (yum but a little dry), and tofu hot stone bimimbap (total comfort food. The same food as the other bimimbap but the hot stone adds a crispness to the rice).\n\nGive it a shot. Snuggle in. Enjoy the experience."

Everything tasted amazing and was all very nicely seasoned. Their take on Korean-American fusion food works beautifully, and we enjoyed every plate of our five course meal. I got really excited since they had grapefruit soju imported from Korea, which I freakin love. Though I would have to say, the star of the night was 100% the bulgogi burger. Oh my goodness, that burger packed a punch. The cut of meat of thick and juicy and tasted incredible with the sauce inside. It was also cooked exactly to the medium rare I requested. The fries were delicious and had some extra seasoning that we both really enjoyed. Their matcha creme brulee was also amazing. The matcha flavor was pretty intense but I usually like my green tea/matcha flavored desserts on the strong side. Their Restaurant Week menu is probably one of the most expansive ones we've ever seen, but we're so glad that it was so we could try a bit of all their popular items. Their usual prices are also not outrageously high either so we'll definitely be back.\n\nCONS: I sort of wished they gave some rice with their banchan or marked somewhere that you can take your time and eat it throughout your meal since people who don't usually eat Korean food would've probably tried to eat an entire thing of kimchi or daikon before they served the next course. Also, the burger is pretty messy to eat since it leaked meat juices the second I picked it up."

Now, I have -never- had success with any place that sells both fried chicken and bibimbap, but you have to give everyone a fighting chance.\n\nThat being said, my boyfriend and I dined al fresco on the tiny streets of Grad Hospital with a soy garlic happy hour appetizer, which were appropriately crunchy and sweet. The only fault was the whopping 3 wings on the plate for the price, but I'm not bitter considering the atmosphere. I also urged him to try out soju, so we split a bottle of Cham, or I guess it's Charm...romanization is weird. I've never had this brand out of the US but it's like a cross between Choeum Cheoreom and Chamiseul: not bad, not great.\n\nOnto the entrees. I gave into the temptation of a steak dolsot bibimbap while my boyfriend bravely (read: naively) ordered jajjangmyun. The bibimbap was about what I expected, but I respect no establishment that doesn't give me the bottle of bibimbap sauce because it needed way more than what they gave me. The jajjangmyun was as disappointing as expected, with hardly any noodles, the sauce on the bottom, and the bonchan used as a garnish (and not even all that nicely). The flavor was kind of there but meh, needed salt.\n\nHopefully Southgate has improved over the months, since this was in August. I'll be back soon!"

Overall, I'd want to come back as the flavors were certainly there and I hope the next experience is even better"

We arrived at 8, ordered by 8:15, and received our order of Korean fried chicken at 8:30, which was fine. And all was going well. Then we waited about an hour for our main entrees which were the bulgogi burger and the tuna rice bowl. Even when the waiter said the food wouldn't only be a few more minutes, it turned into another half hour. I'm not sure what goes on in the kitchen but this is completely unacceptable. We could have eaten 5 dinners in the amount of time it took to get our food. What a shame, because we did enjoy the food. Next time, we'll come at 5pm so we can eat by 8pm.\n\nAt least the 3 refills of water we got during the entire 2 hours was nice and luke warm...."

Can't complain about perfectly fried (multiple times) jumbo wings with good sauces.  I preferred the spicy version better, but it's up to your tastebuds on this one.  For some reason I thought that there would be some mind boggling Korean flavor burst that I've never had before, but to my slight disappointment, they were just really good wings.\n\nAs for the burger, which was just named a Philly's Best, I had a similar problem.  It was cooked perfectly and had nice flavor, but I was expecting some Korean fireworks.  I liked it better with some extra pickles.  Same thing goes for the fries: good, but not what I was expecting.\n\nService was perfect.  They were attentive, well spaced and very friendly.  I like the space, and there was a nice local vibe going on.  It's a place I would drop in on again if I were in the area, but not one that I would walk all the way across the city for, like I did tonight."

The Korean fried chicken (KFC) was legit both in terms of texture (nice exterior crunch w tender meat on the inside) and flavor. But having had KFC at multiple joints previously my opinion is that they're all comparable and though the ones here are outstanding, it's not more amazing than other KFC spots.\n\nI like green tea flavored anything, so I opted to have the fried chicken w green tea Belgian waffle. It had a nice hint of green tea flavor but I wished it was crispier. I tasted my friend's short rib and I thought that was the most scrumptious dish of the day...I might also be swayed by the fact it was accompanied by 2 perfectly poached eggs over rice.\n\nThe Kimchi Bloody Mary was excellent, but it could be spicier. The soju on the side was a nice touch.\n\nService was impeccable, my friends and i felt very well attended to...one of our phones ran out battery and our server returned within a minute w/ a phone charger, and was just so friendly and unintrusive throughout our 3-hour long stay. \n\nSide note: we tried showing up on a Friday night w/out a reservation and there was a 1-2 hr wait so we came back 2 days later for Sunday brunch and was promptly seated w/ ample space left in the restaurant. I don't think most ppl know how awesome their brunch menu is...I would take this place over a lot of other well-known brunch spots in the city any day..."

We ordered the Korean fried chicken for an appetizer.  The fried chicken was $12 for 6 wings. The crunch was good but the sauce lacked flavor, and the spicy sauce isn't that spicy. Nowhere near the best Korean fried chicken in the City. And they were overpriced at $2 per wing. \n\nFor my meal I ordered the burger. The meat was flavorful but the cook was off. It also tasted like it was over marinated, and didn't have the right texture for a hamburger. The fries were OK, but not great. The burger was good, but I do not get the hype. \n\nI tasted the chicken and waffles.  The green tea waffles were delicious. The fried chicken was too, but it was drenched with syrup. It would have been better if it was served on the side. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 ordered the tofu tacos and did not like the way they cooked the tofu. My friend ordered the short rib and really enjoyed it.  \n\nThe server was really good and made very good drinks and recommendations. I order the Soju Hot Toddy and it was really good. Definitely the best thing I had here. I would return for happy hour. The normal menu is a bit overpriced."

        "text": "I know that the concept of Southgate is Korean with an American style, but to be honest I'd say it's the other way around. I felt like I was eating mostly American food influenced by Korean cuisine.  For an appetizer, I ordered the octopus and dduk skewers (unfortunately gobbled it down before getting a picture) but you should know that there were only two pieces and there was only one piece of the octopus confit on each skewer (which was the best part).  The dduk was a little tough - there's a way to cook dduk crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which is what they were going for and did an ok job of.\n\nThe galbi we ordered was really good, but again I really wouldn't have called it galbi.  If you served this to me and I didn't know what the dish was called or where it came from, I would've never suspected it to be Korean.  That being said though, it was really good though just judging it based on its stand alone quality. The meat was really tender and the marinade was delicious, but again I just had to laugh a little at how it was supposed to be remotely Korean.\n\nI also got a beef dolsot bibimbap, and it was really good but also bibimbap is low key one of those things you can't really mess up.  I wish they put a little more of a finishing sesame oil drizzle and more spicy gochujang but overall it was satisfying.\n\nI also ordered a soju flight (they house infuse their sojus) and they were all pretty pleasant and worth a try if you've never had soju before. It's a very impressionable spirit and takes on the flavor of whatever is in it easily, so it may feel a little like drinking juice but the flavor combos were interesting and my partner and I did enjoy them.\n\nService was great, and because of the lovely weather we asked to be seated outside and were able to, so I didn't see much of the interior space. \n\nI think just all in all, it truly was a three and a half to a four star restaurant experience because it's not that the food wasn't good - I just think if you are craving Korean, skip this place. \n\nAnother little tip: don't get the kimchi it was foul.  Also a little miffed they charged for banchan - I know the concept again is \"Korean American\" but I think you'd enjoy just sitting at a fully Korean restaurant and getting your free (and way better quality) banchan experience there with your meal."

Although he was bummed that getting a hot stone bowl would make it a $16 dish so he opted out. I had the japchae which to be honest I'm still thinking about.

Seems almost unfair to review things like wings or fries, silly us for getting them as takeout. I think the restaurant could have done things to help like using a breathable container instead of plastic so things don't get such soggy, or placing two flavors of wings in separate containers so the sauces don't all mix together, but oh well. And our order was messed up... got two of the same side dish instead of the two different things we ordered but wasn't worth the trip back :(\n\nThat being said, the three stars is legit just because we weren't big fans of the flavor. Did like the hearty bun on the chicken sandwich and it was a filling meal. And order was ready within 15 minutes."

My friend got the bibimbap, and said good things about it too. \n\nFor a westernized Korean place, I really enjoyed it.

When the chicken first came out, it was hot, crunchy, and flavorful. Amazing! But after not even 15 mins., the outer layer turned soggy and a bit chewy. I think this was because the coating was thicker compared to other KFC I've had. If you're a slow eater, beware! \n\nNow ... For the experience that had me downing tums all night. To be fair, when we ordered the calamari and shisitos, our waiter mentioned that they were out of the regular peppers and only had the spicy ones left. We were both the type to order extra hot sauce on the side and have had shisito peppers before, so bring it on! Oh what fools we were. When the waiter returned with our order, he reminded us that the peppers were very spicy and actually apologized before, wait for it ... slowly backing away with his palms up! I'm not even exaggerating. But we paid no mind (because hanger) and dug in. One bite of those peppers and we were in a world of regret! After dabbing our foreheads profusely and downing 3 glasses of water each, we wondered if removing the seeds on the inside would make the peppers more palatable.

My sister doesn't have a tolerance for spice, and she tried it and said it tasted identical to the soy wings. The bibimbap was piping hot, and I enjoyed every bite.

I really like this take on it. It feels authentic. Tasted like a beautiful, flavorful marriage of a hot chicken sandwich, a bahn mi and Korean fried chicken (so maybe more like polygamy). \n\nSoju flight - I've never had soju before so thought I'd try the flight.

The burger was cooked appropriately, with a nice spice, but wasn't overly impressive.  The bun was a bit messy.  I was craving a burger, which is why I got something I wouldn't normally consider.  It was fine but nothing overly exciting.  \n\nThe Bibambap is definitely a star here.  Very saucy, a little less spicy than I'd hope, but flavorful and delicious.  The gooey egg was an enjoyable addition and the beef (optional), had the right spice to really enhance the meal.  I definitely would order again.  It was also incredibly filling.\n\nWe also tried the Cheesesteak buns, which were a little more crispy than I was used to, but delicious.  Perhaps a bit too bready, but we enjoyed quite a bit.  \n\nThe service was fast and attentive.  Our drinks, both water and cocktails, were frequently filled and re-ordered.  The place was busy and ideally staffed.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe dumplings were frankly pretty lame.  Unspecial and comparable to standard fare.  \n\nThere was some miscommunication between the kitchen and the server.  One person in our group ordered the dolsot bibambap w/o an egg.  All came served with an egg.  No matter, it was quickly fixed, but the next dolsot bowl left a sizzling meal for what was 20 minutes.  It's great that food comes out hot - that should be the goal!  However, it rendered the meal inedible for a long period of time.  There are worse problems to have, but this stuck out.\n\nOther notes:  Gratuity was included for 6+ guests, which is fine but probably not great for the servers.  The cocktails were slightly overpriced for their quality, but nothing outrageous.  \n\nConclusion:  Southgate is a nice Korean fusion experience for those who want a little adventure, but nothing over the top.  The food is wholesome and enjoyable without being inaccessible.  The service is fast and attentive.  I can and will return!"

        "text": "tl;dr a Korean spin on American bar fare, falling more heavily on the latter cuisine\n\nPromising Korean fusion eats just out of Rittenhouse, Southgate is a popular neighborhood gastropub. I've walked by it countless times, but only just made the time to give it a whirl. The gray-toned palette skips between matte and glossy finishes to compliment dim mood lighting. The walls are decked with a chic take on subway tile. Exposed HVAC, incandescent bumps, and twinkle lights dangle tastefully from the ceiling. Hours and specials are chalked onto a board at the head of the sleek bar that extends the length of the restaurant.\n\nMy partner and I swung by for early weekend dinner and arrived in time for happy hour. We opted for the Banchan Set, the Bulgogi and Pork Steamed Buns, the Korean Fried Chicken, and the Bulgogi Burger (which came with a draft, as part of HH). Of the banchan, my favorites were the zucchini and tofu, both cooked in a rich soy-based sauce and served hot. On the other hand, the kimchi and cucumbers were lukewarm and standard, if not boring. Each dish was large, and I recognize that Southgate is not an authentic Korean restaurant; yet, it still felt off-script for Southgate to charge for banchan. The two-biter buns both had a pillowy bun and nice spicy mayo. While spicy pork was flavorful (and particularly heavy on the sesame), the bulgogi felt dry. Both KFC glazes were yummy with a remarkable depth of flavor (even though the \"spicy\" was not particularly hot). However, they ran a tad soggy with a laughable tiny portion (7 small wings) for the price. The burger was rich, juicy, thick, and heavy, complemented nicely by the tang of pickles and subtly spicy aioli. but was paired with a flimsy bun and flimsier steakhouse fries (I really wish they were shoestring, instead).\n\nAt $56 (after tax and tip) despite the happy hour deals, Southgate definitely errs on the expensive end. Although nothing was actively negative about my experience here, nothing floored me either. As a whole, Southgate definitely rings more American food than Korean -- so if you have a hankering for Korean comfort food, this probably won't do the trick. I may or may not even return to Southgate, depending on whether I ever have the craving for their specific take on fusion cuisine."

The flavors were okay - I still prefer Cafe Soho over these.  Comes with about 6-7 wings.  \n\nI had to get the burger, which was recently rated as the best burger in Philly.  The bulgogi burger is a nice combination of american and korean fusion.  Very juicy and perfectly cooked to medium. I'm a traditionalist so I wouldn't say that this is the best burger in Philly.  This is the best bulgogi burger though! \n\nWifey had the bibimbop and she said it was ok for her standards - I think I would rather get the hot stone pot over at Giwa at 16th and Sansom. \n\nOverall - good new restaurant in the area that I'll come back to!"

        "text": "Recently walked past Southgate and noticed their advertised happy hour, so had to go! From 5-7PM on weekdays AND 2-7 on weekends, Southgate offers both food and drink deals with their indoor and outdoor seating. We strolled by on probably the hottest day of the year and decided to eat outside - probably not the smartest idea, but it actually wasn't as bad as expected with a slight breeze coming in from the street. The outdoor seating was nice and isolated from the street with the covered seating, and the tables were nicely spaced from other diners. And luckily, not many others were as crazy as us to sit outside, so very few people were outside. Our waiter was very attentive to us, making sure our water was always filled especially in the heat. \n\nOf course, we were there for happy hour, and they definitely had a good number of deals available. I opted for the $16 burger and beer. I could chose any beer so opted for a tangerine pale ale, which was very refreshing. The burger was slated for the bulgogi burger, which was excellent - there was a good bit of sauce that made the bun a little soggy, but the flavors were on point. The brioche bun was hefty enough to hold up the contents, and the burger patty itself was very substantial. The burger also came with their homemade fries - thick cut, well seasoned, and plentiful, they were great! For $16, it was an awesome deal! My fiancee got the $4 draft beer of the day, which was a watermelon ale. Very refreshing as well! He got the $10 burger of the day, the kimchi burger - he loved it!! There was a ton of kimchi on the burger, and the kimchi was very good - nice level of spice, crunchy veggies, and bacon, a unique taste. He was a big fan! While his didn't come with fries, luckily I had plenty to share so we splitsies. \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our happy hour meal at Southgate - the deals were on point, and the food was good! While it wasn't the best burger I've ever had, it was quite a unique take and the deals couldn't be beat. We hope to make it back for another HH to try more of their offerings, and to try their Korean fried chicken, which seems to be highly regarded. Thanks for a great meal despite the sweltering heat, Southgate!"

It's kind of impressive how many people they serve here with what looks to be a a kitchen the size of a large bathroom. It probably isn't their only kitchen but if it is, good on them for being efficient. \n\n\"koreancini\" = 1/5 - I would not get this. Dry, terrible texture, no flavor. Didn't go well with the dipping sauce. \n\n\"KFC\" = 3/5 - a solid rendition of KFC. I'd put slightly below Federal but way below Andy's Fried Chicken. Size of the wings were decent and the batter was solid. Could have used a little more sauce.\n\nbibimbap = 3/5 - also a decent rendition of bibimbap. I ordered mine with beef and it came in a stone pot. For $18, it was kind of small. Needed more gochujang which the waiter was happy to oblige. \n\nIt's nice to get some korean food in Philly.

The tofu was my favorite. It had a nice sauce and the outer edges were lightly crispy. The dumplings were also tasty. The eggplant was good, but I was expecting a warm dish, so just keep in mind that the eggplant is served cold. \n\nThe restaurant was lively and full of people.

        "text": "I got an itch to \"try something new\" and my boyfriend suggested Southgate. It's just a couple blocks from us and we kept walking by saying we had to try it some day but we never got around to it. Last night was THE night! I made a reservation for 2 at 7:30 on a Thursday. We probably didn't need it, but shortly after we got there the place did fill up.\n\nThe place... Is small. Borderline claustrophobic. The bar takes up half of the restaurant. If you want to try this place and also enjoy breathing then I recommend waiting until the weather is nice and you can sit outside. It was a tight squeeze and we are two tiny people. Did not like that the entire restaurant is basically one long bench with tables and chairs pulled up to it. I know a lot of restaurants are like that now but I really do enjoy having a more private table. I did use the bathroom before leaving and while it was freezing down there I do love me a restaurant with gender neutral bathrooms. There's never a line.\n\nThe server was great. I think his name was Evan. He was attentive and genuinely seemed to enjoy working there. Good for him!\n\nWe ordered some new and exciting beers. My boyfriend tried something from Korea and I tried something from Japan that was labeled a witbier on the menu. It wasn't what I am used to from American witbiers ... It had a funky aftertaste that I usually would expect from an IPA and I really hate IPAs. But it was a $12 bottled beer so I couldn't exactly have tried it before I bought it. Should have gone with the cider or the hot toddy! Boyfriend thought his beer was okay but ended up getting a Sapporo. \n\nWe started off with the soy kfc, which was perfectly crunchy yet moist and flavorful, and the short rib steamed buns. I expected more of a bao bun for some reason on the steamed buns and these were more like a dry biscuit so that was a little sad to me. Boyfriend ate the rest of my bun so I could save room for dinner. For our entrees I ordered from that night's special menu, the glass noodles, and boyfriend ordered a bowl of bibimbap. He liked his dish (can't go wrong with a hot bowl on a cold night!) but mine was unexpectedly spicy. It's entirely possible the menu warned me about the spice but we had a couple drinks before dinner and I may have just seen the word \"noodle\" and got excited and ordered without a proper read. I ordered it \"with seafood\" and it came with shrimp, calamari, and little baby squiddy jawns. It was flavorful and had some nice textures to it, but the spice got me. I ate about half of it and had to take the rest home.\n\nOverall, I was happy I tried something new and that itch was completely scratched for the evening, but I think if we came back we would pop over for happy hour (every day!) and stick to the appetizers menu. I would also switch up the drink and try a cocktail. I told a coworker about our dinner there and she said the appetizers are really where its at and we made a bad call getting entrees. I'm willing to give it another go some day, but based on this experience it's a solid meh so I am in no rush."
