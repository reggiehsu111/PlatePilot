Also, it didn't come with rice which I thought was weird, and they charged me $2 for a small bowl of white rice, so the $4.95 yukgaejang became a $6.95 yukjgaejang. The pa-jeon was just ok too. \n\nI guess Philly has a pretty weak Korean food scene in general, but I wanted this place to be a little better. If it was next door I'd probably hit it up every now and then, but the problem is that we're not that close to here, and its just not good enough to warrant going very far for it. \n\nInside only seats six."

He also tried shrimp pancakes and kimchi. Both of us enjoyed our stone bowls. My only complaint is that it was spicy, which some people may not love, but I enjoyed it. One thing that was noted is that the beef is scarce, but the portion overall was good. He also liked both other dishes, declaring the kimchi the best ever. In addition, we both got the ginger cinnamon tea that is made in house. While I liked that it was not sweet, he would have preferred a lift sweetness.

There's not a lot about bibimbap to screw up, and a lot of it hinges on fresh crisp vegetables and your gochujang/kochujang.  This guy makes a bangin' gochujang and everything is done exactly how it should be.  I had a chicken bibimbap, but the protein you pick really doesn't impact the dish very much, honestly.\n\nIt's not particularly traditional, but it does have the basic spirit of bibimbap:  take a bunch of leftover vegetables and turn it into something new.  Mine had fresh broccoli, carrots, cucumbers and sprouts - none of them seemed to be dressed or pickled.  Honestly, no flavor was lost by that - the kochujang seasons it perfectly.\n\nI'll certainly be back."

This came to me in a large aluminum bowl to accentuate the size of the meal. I wasn't completely wowed even knowing full well the guy prepared it just there and then. Good assortment of veggies, rice, meat but definitely echo some of the other reviewers here - it just wasn't enough. Typically bibimbap makes me keel over from sheer amazingness; quality and quantity and delicious. This gave me more of an: it's alright, feels sufficient.

This place is literally the best, most authentic korean food I've had thus far in philadelphia. They offer only a limited menu of bibimbap (with various proteins), pajeon (scallion pancake), and yuk gae jang (beef stew), but they do it right! I think it's advertised as a take-out joint, but the actual restaurant is a hole in a wall spot on south st that seats about 8-10 people, max. I saw the glowing reviews and though skeptical, decided to bike down here with a friend for dinner and was not disappointed. The pajeon was smaller than I imagined, but delicious and surprisingly filling - certainly enough to hold you over until the main dish. I love traditional bibimbap, and BAP does it SO SO well. I always get the classic marinated beef as my protein, and this particular version comes with soybean, carrots, cucumbers, mushroom, cabbage, a gooey egg, and broccoli! I would HIGHLY recommend paying the extra dollar for the dolsot option to get that crunchy rice on the bottom for more flavor! Love this place and will definitely be back whenever I need my korean food fix! Maybe I'll try the yuk gae jang next time!\n\nTIP: bring cash if you can!"

The friendly owner and tasty food warmed my cold, cynical heart today. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the Korean savory pancake and the vegetable bimbimbap. The vegetables were fresh and crispy, and the ingredients and flavors were well-balanced. Great little spot for a quick, casual bite to eat. \n\nWhat makes this place 5-star worthy was the owner, who was unbelievably accommodating, generous, and friendly. The place has a neighborhood feel that makes it a very welcome addition on South Street. I'll definitely be back!"

Only 3 differences: (1) It was larger than the portions I had in Korea, (2) The egg was cooked, not runny or raw, and (3) I had to ask for the (hot) sauce. The homemade tea was good too. The place itself is tiny, and the owner incredibly nice. I would return in a heartbeat."

So when I noticed BAP's signage while walking home after grocery shopping, I made a mental note to try them asap since their opening special of $5 bibimbap is awesome!\n\nYou can't beat a cheap meal, and especially one that's prepared with obviously fresh vegetables! My husband picked up our dinner right before I got off from work, but it's so cold outside we had to reheat them - thankfully the microwave didn't ruin anything. He got the beef and I opted just for the vegetables, both of which came with an egg. The variety of veggies is great, but most importantly they are clearly fresh, not frozen or canned, and it makes a huge difference with bibimbap. The sauces were good, but I felt like the veggie one lacked a little bit on flavors. Spicy level was minimal when you mixed everything together, so I ended up adding more for myself. We will certainly be back for more yummy, healthy, and quick takeout from this super cute spot!"

Despite the fact that the beef bibim bap costs $2 more than the vegetable version, there was very little meat in the dish. The food was ok, but I prefer Giwa, and it didn't come with any sides. The rice also comes pre-coated in spicy sauce, which I didn't mind but may be a problem for people who prefer their food totally mild or want to customize the spice level. Altogether a perfectly fine Korean joint, but next time I'll probably walk the extra few blocks to go to Giwa."

This is the genuine article and the owner is super nice - I just can't believe I am here by myself!  Next time I will bring a friend even if I have to drag one off the street!  The spice was just right, the serving size was just right, and the stone bowl kept everything warm to the end."

FYI - closed on Sundays.\n\nTheir regular bibimbap is $7.95 to $9.95 (veggie v. meats). If you want it in a hot stone pot (dolsot bibimbap), its $1 extra. Perks of dolsot - the stone pot crisps up the bottom of the rice which adds a great texture. However, the hot stone pot cooled quickly and I didn't feel like I got enough of a crisp on my rice. Of note, it comes pre-mixed with the sauce, which I wasn't expecting. Meanwhile, if you order the regular it does not come pre-mixed so the vegetables/meat are separated and you can decide how much hot sauce you want to mix in. For this reason, I'd probably get the regular next time.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the chicken dolsot bibimbap and the vegetable dolsot bibimbap. Not the best bibimbap I've ever had. Since it came pre-mixed, it's very similar to spicy fried rice, especially since I didn't get enough crispy rice. They all come topped with an over-easy egg, the yolk of which makes a great sauce. For $9.95 and $10.95 it was a bit pricey, since the portions are not very large. We also ordered the seafood pancake, which was delicious, but again a bit pricey since it didn't taste like it was made from scratch.\n\nOverall, lovely little spot. My boyfriend and I enjoyed it for a quick weekday lunch date, but I don't think I'd go out of my way again to return."

We ordered the chicken and beef bibimbap. The owner was very nice, the food came out quickly, and the seating area was well maintained. \nWhile I enjoyed my meal, it wasn't outstanding. The veggies and beef were just okay. Unfortunately, I think they were overpowered by the sauce - which was a notch spicier than I wanted.

There was a variety of fresh, cooked veggies (broccoli, carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, cucumbers and probably some others I'm forgetting like assorted greens),  the spicy red, Korean Gochujang sauce, a fried egg, chicken and sticky white rice (I love that kind of rice!).

The menu is just a few items long and largely consists of different types of bibimbap, all under $10. Ordering was really effortless -- I called ahead with my order for a vegetable and chicken bibimbap and it was ready within 15 minutes. Pickup was also easy and done at a window in the front of the store with a really nice elderly man who I assume is one of the owners. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they gave us free coffee packets which I have since used (I love me some Vietnamese iced coffee). \n\nThe food itself was okay. With the price point, the speed of service, and the no frills menu, I assume the bibimbap is meant to compete with other fast food options, and as a result it should be critiqued as such. Within this category of food, BAP provides a light, healthy, and balanced alternative, which I appreciated. However I think the portion size of the vegetable one was a little small and the flavor slightly bland. You'd do better with spending that extra dollar for additional tofu or meat. Overall, though, it was fine for a $9 bibimbap if you're looking for it.

It is a standard price for korean food. A little higher than other joints. In all I spent over 15 dollars for a bowl of beef bibimpop and veggie pancake.\nFirst the pancake. I didn't like that it was very eggy compared to all that I have tried. It lacked crispness and it lacked. . . Flavor. It was as if it was reheated, although I'm not sure. It wasn't hot and it wasn't crunchy and it wasn't tasty.\nAs for my bibimpop I wasn't impressed. It was very standard for 11 bucks. The veggies were assorted and it tastes exactly what it looks like, if you want the crispy bowl it jacks up to 12 bucks. I've been to many joints and I would say this caters to the not so asian crowd."

BAP, you are truly a gift from heaven for a girl trying to survive. From the sleek, barebones menu to the presentation, to giving me the option to add as much gochujang as I want at my table, to taking credit cards, I am so happy this place exists. Now, it was pretty empty when I went, but it seems like they are surviving from Uber Eats. \n\nMy -only- critique is that dolsot bibimbap is better with a raw egg rather than pre-fried, so I'm going to try that special request next time I stop by. Other than that, the staff is very friendly, the atmoshpere is pretty cozy, and the food comes pretty fast. \n\nBut I would recommend you skip on the pajeon: it's not that great and it's all about the stone rice bowl burning your mouth for an hour."

I didn't even know there was a bibimbap specialty place nearby.\n\nI kind of like the concept of a stand alone bibimbap place. The dining area of the restaurant isn't currently open, so you can call in an order or walk up. I walked up and ordered and received my food relatively quickly.\n\nI ordered the dolsot bibimbap with beef. I didn't know how the dolsot bibimbap was made without the stone bowl, which usually cooks the rice while your eating, so you can a nice crust around your rice towards the end of your meal. Basically the dolsot bibimbap to go was mimicking that experience with frying the ingredients before serving. At first, I thought the portion size was a bit small, but after eating it, I was surprised how filling it was. The gochujang or hot sauce was mixed in. The food was cooked well and it tasted great. It had a good amount of spice.\n\nThe only compaint I had about this place was that it's a bit pricey for my specific order. It was close to $14 for a relatively small rice dish. Maybe next time I may order a dish without the dolsot ($1) and beef ($3) upgrade and see how it is. The vegetable bibimbap seems decently priced at $8.95."

I love Korean food, and I fancy Bibimbap and korean pancakes. However, both versions at BAP were just a few notes short. The pancakes were dry and thick and fairly bland. The bibimbap, granted we got the regular version (non hot pot), was served almost at cool-room temperature without any close attention to how the flavors and texture coexisted with each other. The Japchae (noodle) was the greatest disappointment as it was served with a larger and too generous portion of white rice without any other sustenance. \n\nObjectively, the food was underwhelming, but if you take in the whole picture, the small and unassuming quaint place settings, you'd have a good time.\n\nFood: 2-3 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars\nService: 3 stars\nPrice: 3 stars"

I got take out and the portion was small. The ingredients didn't even fill to the brim and they even skimped on the rice. \n\nThe dish just tasted \"too homemade\" to me but NOT homemade in a good way. It tasted \"homemade\" like it was made by a cook that had only okay culinary skills (not homemade like your grandma's cooking). It lacked flavor and presentation. The rice was too sticky. The veggies looked limpy and tasted boring (blocky stir-fried cucumbers pieces, carrots not meticulously julienned, spinach just boiled but not seasoned). The beef pieces weren't even restaurant quality, not tender at all. The gochujang was the same stuff you can buy from the Korean super market with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I could probably make the same at home fairly easily using only oil, salt, and sesame seeds as seasoning and no advanced marinades, special sauces, or knife skills.\n\nIt didn't taste terrible, but it was underwhelming compared to bibimbop I've had at other Korean restaurants. I don't know about you but I eat out to experience dishes I cannot recreate (or would take significant effort to recreate) at home. For what you get, they should just charge $6 for a plain boxed lunch, not $10!\n\nThe cinnamon iced tea is also nothing to rave about. It just tastes like weak homemade generic green tea with cinnamon dumped in. The cinnamon doesn't even compliment the tea! $3 a bottle, too! In case you were wondering, unsweetened. Unsweetened cinnamon tastes disgusting/pointless, at least sweeten your damn tea.\n\nI feel like this place is trying too hard to have that specialty/gourmet mom-and-pop feel, marketed towards boogie hipster patrons but the quality/creativity is just not there. I feel super ripped off!\n\nDon't come here because it \"looks cute\" or because you like \"hole in the wall\" restaurants. Usually hole in the wall restaurants serve brilliant food but this one is not one of them. \n\nP.S. I put a photo of the food on my Facebook (like I always do with restaurant foods) and my foodie Korean friend said \"This is from BAP? Oh man ouch...\" I feel ashamed. For once no one was jealous of my food pic because it didn't look that good."

Since I've left Philly, I haven't found bibimbap anywhere else in the US that's been as good. It's genuinely exceptional, whether you opt for the stone pot (dolsot) or not. \n\nBut the real kicker here isn't just the amazing food- it's the man behind it all. Francis is special- he's a great chef but an even better person. By running this restaurant, he's helped put his daughter through college and grad school, and supported his family altogether. I'm so happy to see all his hard work paying off!
