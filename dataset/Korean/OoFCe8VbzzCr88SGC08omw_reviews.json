I didn't care too much for the fried rice but the rest was tasty. Service was not great but we had brought wine to enjoy and this the slowness wasn't too bothersome. The menu is accessible and reasonably priced. Love that it's BYO. I probably wouldn't make a special trip to come here but if I found myself in the area would return for dinner and to try some new things."

The food people posted looked good and we gave it a shot. We were not disappointed at all. We had the Korean Chili wings, Kim-Chi Fried rice and the Spicy Pork Bowl.\n\nWe wish the Korean Chili wings were a little bit spicier. However, we did like the fact they were super crispy and boneless. We weren't really looking to get our hands super messy last night so it was perfect!\n\nThe Kim-Fried rice was pretty good. It wasn't too spicy and it didn't have a sour after taste like some places we have tried. The portion was also perfect. not too overwhelming at all. \n\nI felt like the Spicy Pork Bowl was the best. Normally, when you order a hot stone bowl the rice at the bottom tends to burn very quickly. When I started tossing the rice to mix it with the veggies and the pork. It wasn't burnt at the bottom either! The green onions were a little big they weren't cut into bite size so I picked them out of the bowl. Besides that everything was great. \n\nThere's not a lot of Korean places that I would recommend but I would definitely go here."

If you like short ribs, you'll love the Galbi skillet or rice bowl. The short rib is so tender and the flavor is to die for. Real Unami. Today I tried two new things that I will definitely be ordering again; the scallion pancake and shrimp fries! Both were amazing!! \nI love the inside of this restaurant. It is cozy yet feels spacious because of the high ceilings. The brick walls, candles, murals, and lighting add the it's welcoming and warm vibe. I love coming to Buk Chon with friends for a fun night or with my boyfriend for a quiet date. Service cannot be beat! Takeout is also always another great option for us Old City locals as well. \nThird time back this week. Will be back very soon!"

Everything was so flavorful and I am so so glad that spicy means spicy here! \n\nWith the stunning brick walls, a large industrial style chandelier, beautiful charcoal gray stone bowls, clean presentation and amazing food, this place clearly is one of the top Korean restaurants in Philly.

It's not your mom's traditional Korean restaurant, it had some modern/hip feel to it, and appears to have been a renovated bar.  The narrow entry way leads to more spaced out, dimly lit seating in the back.  \n\nThe menu was pretty standard of a Korean restaurant, appetizers such as korean wings, entrees such as bibimbap, spicy noodles, etc. I got the short rib Bibimbap for $15 while my colleagues both got the spicey soup.  Because it was a new year special, they provided a nice little rice cake soup, nice touch.  \n\nOverall, the food and service was good, no complaints.

In fact, I'm just recently back from traveling and it's the first meal thought about and craved!! \n\nWe came for a large family lunch and had no problem reserving a table last minute in their somewhat odd fitting medieval feeling small dining room on a Sunday afternoon. (Watch out, they do close between lunch and dinner from 3-5pm!) I LOVED their exposed brick walls, nooks for their dripping white pillar candles, street art mural and chandelier! Good vibes!! \n\nI shared the tofu clay pot bibimbap with my daughter. It was tasty, piping hot and filled with veggies and crisped rice!! Delish! They give you your choice of sauce to mix in if you so choose, but I ate it plain and really enjoyed it! (It's vegan minus the egg to top.) My sister in law had the same thing only with beef and thoroughly enjoyed hers. (She's Korean, I think that holds some weight!) \n\nMy youngest ordered her Korean favorite and a great vegetarian option, the japache, but here it's served with sweet potato noodles. It was so delish!! Perfectly cooked noodles and big vegetables in a warm, comforting toasted sesame oil! Yum! \n\nThe table also ordered the Tteokbokki to share. It's a Chili rice cake gnocchi! I was so intrigued! There's both rice and fish cakes, so veg heads, examine closely if splitting this one. The sauce has a great kick! It's a traditional dish made modern with the addition of the mozzarella cheese. (The fusion of new and classic seems to be a theme with the entire menu, so keep your minds open if you're looking for a more traditional Korean meal here) \n\nMy brother, who lived in Korea for years was happy to see \"Army Stew\", which is apparently somewhat rare in the states. \n\nEveryone was pleased and we immediately spoke about a return visit! \n\nPrices were reasonable and it's BYO!\n\nHappy Hour is Tues, Wed, Thurs, Sun from 5-7.

It is not the most authentic korean restaurant and is more catered toward the locals in the old city area. \n\nI went here twice and I must recommend the ddukbokki which they call \"chilli rice gnocci\" and the seafood panacake.  For a main dish, the stone bowls/beef bowls are decent. However the soft tofu stew is better in more authenic restaurants.  I would mostly come here for the tasty appetizers, atmosphere, and BYOB experience."

To be honest, it's not my favorite Korean restaurant in the Philly area - indeed I prefer many of the ones in the Koreatown around Cheltenham Avenue - but there is still much to like here.\n\nThe physical look of the place is def appealing to the eyes - especially the rear space with the great chandelier and exposed brick wall embedded with candles.  An order of tasty pickled eggplants began the evening. Do note - there are no complimentary Banchan here.  The Korean fried chicken with chili sauce was as good as I expected.  And last but not least, the Galbi rice bowl had tender roast beef served over a sizable portion of rice. Service was decent and both my friend and I said we would return."

The ambiance and service were warm, the place was clean,  and the food was uniformly delicious, and made of high quality ingredients, for very fair prices. I had the scallion pancake appetizer and the ribeye bibimbap. Husband had the fried chicken appetizer and the pork bibimbap. I don't think the chefs were going for strict Korean authenticity, maybe more of a fusion cuisine, but it was all nonetheless very tasty.\nWe saw that a previous reviewer gave one star based on a complaint about problems using a Travelzoo voucher. We, too, used a Travelzoo voucher, and experienced no issues. The voucher's terms are generous; we saw only one entree on the menu that exceeded the voucher's dollar limit. \nAnother reviewer also gave one star, in part based on a very inappropriate restroom sign. \nI did not see such a sign in the restroom area, and asked our server about it. She said management had been horrified to realize it was there, left over from the previous business in the space, and had taken it down before they even saw that review."

Finally the chapchae. It had the right amount of sesame oil on it. My son added some bulgogi meat in it and it tasted even better!!!!

I'd probably choose differently second time around but if that's your thing, go for it."

        "text": "In response to some of the complaints that this place's prices are higher than the average Korean spot: I don't see why Europeans/European food should have a monopoly on fancier restaurant vibes with higher priced menus- and they don't own \"fusion\" or putting imaginative spins on traditional dishes either! Don't non-white restauranteurs also deserve to make some money? \n\nOtherwise: I FREAKING LOVE THIS PLACE. I moved into an apartment building down the street from them 3 weeks ago, and since then have been there about 10 times. \n\nI'm a chef and am pretty hard to please. I always feel ripped off if I'm served something I feel like I could have made just as well as home. Like yeah, I am just a white gal and a relative newcomer to Korean cuisine, but I learned how to make certain dishes like Bulgogi from Maangchi's blog a few years ago, and have made it so many times since for professional gigs. Buk Chon's bulgogi is MILES BETTER. The overall flavor is of course the same, but it is a more interesting presentation: you can taste several more of the ingredients- so well-layered but subtle!!\n\nI also have a big appetite, so was surprised to see some reviews complaining about portion size! The first time I went to Buk Chon for dinner, my partner and I shared the pork buns appetizer, and then both got an entree. This was WAY too much food. Several times since then, I have split two appetizers and the Bibimbap (my favorite!) with a friend. This has been the perfect amount of food. And it's SO NICE that the restaurant is cool with this- often \"nicer\" places insist on everyone order their own entree, or they'll add a fee to \"make up\" for the person or people who did not order their own. I'd actually be willing to pay more money for this now-routine of ordering a single entree, because all of them have always been so delicious!\n\nOh- if you go for lunch and order the discounted lunch special, the portions are smaller than when you pay full price at dinner. This is not unusual among restaurants I've been to in general.\n\nLast thing: I also love the Chinese green tea and think it complements much of the food well. \n\nEvery time I walk past and see someone(s) peering at the menu outside, I stop and encourage them to go in. And the same to everyone reading this!"

This was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I was visiting Philadelphia with some friends for the weekend and this was the only dinner place we went to and all of us were pretty disappointed.\n\nServers don't walk around ever asking if we need anything and they barely came to our side of the restaurant so it was hard to flag them down for things. It wasn't even busy at all. We realized halfway through eating that some of us did not receive our side dishes with our meals. After waiting to flag them down, we asked if we could get our side dishes and the server just looked at us super confused and said, \"Well did you order any?\" This restaurant has a pretty small menu, so it blew my mind that the server couldn't just look at our food, and realize that certain ones came with side dishes. She just looked at us as if we were stupid for asking like we didn't read the menu ourselves. And someone in our group did order the side dish platter, which he did not receive either. She said she'll look at our receipt to see if we needed any, and then she came back eventually saying that yes we were supposed to get some side dishes and in-genuinely apologized. \n\nServers would come around once in a while to refill our water but never ask us, \"How is the food?\" \"Do you guys need anything else?\" \"Would you like a togo box?\" \"Do you want the check?\" The staff was so awkward and quiet and didn't seem like they were trained at all on customer service. \n\nMy friend ordered the bibimbap with chicken but when we received his food he said, \"I ordered chicken but this is beef,\" and the server said, \"Oh we ran out of chicken.\" First of all, why couldn't you have told my friend that earlier instead of just serving him a different meat option? Why did you just assume he would be ok with beef, what if he couldn't eat beef? She didn't even say sorry for the mistake, she just gave it to him and he just awkwardly accepted it so he could start eating because we had waited over 30 minutes for our food.\n\nThe food wasn't that great either. They tried glamorizing the names of simple Korean dishes to make it seem fancier than it actually is. Kimchi paella is just kimchi fried rice, calling basic Korean dishes a different name does not make it fusion or make it taste any better.\n\nOverall, this restaurant needs to work on their staff and customer service. I've never left a restaurant so upset for being treated so poorly by staff who clearly don't know how to say sorry. It's your job to ask us if we need anything. I don't know the names of the two girls that served us but I really hope they learn how to treat customers better. As a Korean-American, it's pretty disappointing that this place has mediocre service and lackluster food."

When eating Korean food (also one of my favs), I expect side dishes. I understand the 'style' of meal that comes with side is Banchan but business may depend on this. Many of us do not expect to pay $3 for Kimchi, well I don't and I didn't.\n\nI started with the Korean Fried Chicken which I could not clearly determine was chicken. When I offered the left overs to a friend they quickly mentioned the same. It appears to be pieces of chopped chicken not specifically from the breast or thigh that's coated and fried, then dipped in a sauce. The chili sauce was tasty, not necessarily different or special just okay. I really did enjoy the Spicy Pork in a hot stone bowl, very tasty and filled with pork. Because I went during 'Happy Hour' the appetizer was half off because I purchased an entree.\n\nThe decor is modern, crisp with clean lines and low or pub seats. I was approached and seated immediately however service was slow and the server was inattentive. This was not acceptable considering I was the only one in the restaurant.

Although there are a million other great eats in Philadelphia, I definitely can't wait to return.\nDid I mention there was happy hour on a weekend? For the life of me, I can't remember what it is. I'm pretty sure its 1/2 off an appetizer with any purchase of an entree. Can anyone confirm this?\n\nWhat we ordered: \nJapchae: stir-fried sweet potato noodles with assorted veggies\n\nWe had to order a noodle dish. It would be un-Korean to do so. The veggies and sweet potato noodles were a great mix of flavor. I love sweet potatoes, so any time I can incorporate them into my meal, I'm in. I'll order 6 more, please.\n\nKorean Fried Chicken: double-fried boneless chicken thighs in Korean Chili sauce\n\nThis was hands-down the best thing I ate during dinner. The chili sauce had a great balance of sweetness and heat. The chicken was still moist inside. Still thinking about that delicious appetizer. YES PLEASE.\n\nChili Rice Gnocchi: rice gnocchi, fish tofu with chili paste topped with mozzarella.\n\nHave you ever ordered gnocchi at an Asian restaurant? I know I haven't before. It was okay, definitely not my favorite part but definitely an interesting twist on the cuisine. I didn't care for the tomato base and mozzarella, but then again, I can't really handle cheese anymore. The fish tofu had a unique texture which I enjoyed and it wasn't overly fishy.\n\nGalbi Bourguignon: slow-braised short ribs with mushrooms and asparagus skillet\n\nThe amount of food in each entr\u00e9e was absurd. Three hungry girls barely made a dent in this. The flavors were really well balanced and really flavorful in the Galbi; however, the texture wasn't for me. It was similar to a pot roast. It was delicious but needed a different texture to separate it from the vegetables. When I added the rice, it was a much more complete dish.\n\nSpicy Pork: grilled spicy pork over rice and assorted vegetable skillet\n\nDefinitely my favorite dinner entr\u00e9e. The pork had a great amount of heat that carried through each bite, but not spicy enough to take over the whole meal. The pork had a slight sear on it which made it have a slightly different texture. I thought it was great.\n\nRibeye Bulgogi: thinly sliced grilled beef with assorted vegetable.\n\nA really good representation of bulgogi. The Korean beef on top of some vinegar-seasoned rice definitely hit the spot after walking around the city for a lot of the day. The grilled beef had a great flavor.\n\nSide of Kimchi\n\nI love kimchi. If I could put it on everything, I probably would. It doesn't last long when I have it in my house.\n\nI thought all the dishes were large in size. The entrees came with sides of rice. I had leftovers for a few days and I was terribly sad when they were all eaten. If you are in the Old City area and need a bite to eat, definitely head to Buk Chon. You won't be disappointed."

We were excited to get some Korean food and for a great price of $10. \n\nWe ordered the kimchi rice with pork and the teriyaki chicken with vegetables. The Kimchi rice was not very spicy, but definitely had a nice little kick to remind you about that kimchi. It also brought a very over easy egg on top to help with the protein portion. \n\nThe teriyaki chicken was really sweet, a super thick sauce on it. It was good, just not great. The chicken portion was also really small, way more veggies. The seaweed and cucumber sides were quite small but good compliments to the dishes.  \n\nThe service was a bit slow, and we were literally the only people here. The ladies working were not friendly at all. \n\nOverall, I think the place is ok, not somewhere I'm running back to."

The menu with its westernized names, the modern inner ambiance, and the high prices make the restaurant seem at first glance like a fusion restaurant, but the food actually tasted more authentic than I expected (except the banchan) -- don't let the words \"gnocchi\" and \"kale\" on the menu throw you off too much :)"

They have a pretty small menu so it's not too overwhelming. The service was decent but the food did take forever to arrive. \n\nI feel like their flavor profile has been greatly Americanized. Everything is on the milder side. Sauces tasted water down. I had the seafood pancake, beef bulgogi skillet and the spicy pork bibimbap. The seafood pancake came with a decent amount of seafood and crispy around the edges, but the dipping sauce was way too vinegary. The beef bulgogi tasted more like stir fried beef than bulgogi. The bibimbap came in a stone pot so that was nice. I wasn't a fan of their gochujang sauce though. It was way too sweet, watery and lacked heat. The worst part of all was we had to pay for the banchans! What kind of Korean restaurant doesn't come with complimentary banchans?!?! It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and not receiving complimentary chips. Told you this place isn't legit. \n\nNot the most authentic Korean restaurant in the area.

Buk Chon's menu is pretty limited and it's not exactly traditional Korean food (I think) but the flavors are absolutely fantastic. They don't serve free banchan (side dishes) and the appetizers are on the smaller side but these things are not a deal breaker for me because the quality makes up for it all. These are the things that I've tried so far:\n\n1. Seafood pancake - nice and crispy on the outside while soft and chewy on the inside and packed with seafood. The portion is very small so don't be surprised when you order.\n\n2. Kimchi & tofu appetizer - delicious stir fry kimchi and pork with lightly pan fried firm tofu. Also, a very small portion.\n\n3. Spicy pork over rice - a real winner. Tons of pork over rice seasoned perfectly. Be careful because it's served in piping hot stone bowl and you can easily burn your mouth eating this. Just scoop the food onto your plate for it to cool and enjoy!\n\n4. Galbi bourgiunon - tender, fall off the bone short ribs in a delicious, savory, thick sauce. The galbi is not cut like the traditional galbi (flanken style) but more like the regular English style cut. A very comforting dish!\n\n5. Soondubu (tofu soup) - the flavor of their tofu soup is not as good as the Korean restaurants in North Philly but pretty good compared to other restaurants around the center city area.\n\n6. Chili gnocchi - Korean rice cakes in a spicy tomato sauce with fish cake and cheese. It was too spicy and the rice cakes were a tad undercooked when I ordered it. The only item I would not order again from here."

This is usually my favorite and I was looking forward to trying it here but it was pretty meh. \n \nI had the beef bulgogi with purple rice (a combo of black and white rice ) which comes with 4 banchan (unfortunately not of your choice): pickled radish, pickled eggplant, green bean salad and cucumbers. Of everything I tried I have to say that the pickled eggplant was my favorite (random, I know). Delightfully sweet with a tang. The bulgogi was ok, and pretty good value for money (I did enjoy my leftovers later). \n\nMy husband tried the paella (pork and chorizo, there are other options). I honestly was not expecting to see something like that on the menu, a creative twist which tasted pretty good...very greasy and more reminiscent of jollof rice rather than traditional paella but good. \n\nThe service left a lot to be desired (and why I feel like I can't give more than 3 stars). We came at a reasonably slow time. (there were only 2 other tables occupied when we came in) but still seemed understaffed. Took a while for someone to seat us, we just waited awkwardly at the door. Took a while for a server to bring water and to refill throughout the meal (we had to call someone over and ask a few times)...just inattentive.

We got to the restaurant at 9:30 pm on a Saturday just in time for last call for orders (about 9:45) and tried the Spicy Pork Buns, Kimchi Paella with Pork/Chorizo, and the Fire Chicken (original spicy), all of which we would recommend! The entrees are so big that we could have been full with just 1 rather than 2 but the food was so good we were happy to take leftovers back home. The Kimchi Paella was our favorite as it was such a unique fusion and the crispy rice on the sides that result from the stone bowl can't be beat. Spice levels were not super high, but we were okay with it since the food itself was all piping hot in temperature. Prices are also very reasonable especially for how delicious and big portioned the food was!"

She was happy to give us recommendations of her favorite dishes.\n\nFood: We ordered the rib eye beef bibimbap and seafood soft tofu soup (soondubu-jjigae). Though the food was decent, it was not particularly flavorful - the soft tofu soup was not really spicy and a bit bland, while the beef in the bibimbap was not notably outstanding. We also did not feel completely full by the end of our meal. If you are looking for good Korean food, there are probably better options elsewhere that are more filling and not as overpriced. \n\nOverall: Although the atmosphere and service was nice, we did not think the food was entirely worth the money.

We started off with the \"chili rice gnocchi\" otherwise known as ddukbokki (I had to check the Korean text next to the name to confirm it was the same thing). It was nice and spicy but I'm not used to my ddukbokki being topped with mozzarella cheese. Then we ordered the japchae with beef which was pretty good. The two dishes were appetizers and priced accordingly but the portion sizes were smaller than expected. Then we split the stone pot bibimbap with beef, which was solid, exactly what I expected.

It is a very small restaurant, however, you can't tell because of the super high ceilings and chandelier, which makes the room look larger than what it is. Definitely a cozy spot, would not be ideal for large groups, but I'm sure the restaurant can accommodate.\n\nSecondly, the food. Love that main entrees come with banchan! Ordered a bunch of appetizers like the Korean fried chicken, tteok bboki (not shown), and seafood japchae. These were all very good, truly appetizer size lol so keep that in mind. M brother got the Korean fried rice, while my mom and I shared the bulgogi. The fried rice was good, considered mild but def on the spicier side. Bulgogi was also good, however wish it had more of the marinade. \n\nFinally, BYOB! Enough said lol.\n\nWould recommend for a nice lunch/dinner with a friend!"

Unlike most Korean restaurants, you don't get any kimchi or banchan either, which you must pay extra for here. This place is BYO though, so my friend was able to run across the street and grab some soju, which they provided shot glasses for. In a flash of genius, I ordered a drink to use as a mixer, forget what it was called but it was basically Calpico.\n\nI got the pork bibimbap and it was such a small portion, my bowl was only half full with just a small \"pie chart\" section of meat. They could have at least put more rice in the bowl since that's such a cheap ingredient. Should have gotten the spicy pork bowl instead for the same price. At least the flavor was good.\n\nOne thing that was a very off-putting to me was how they weirdly whitewashed all of the names of these very typical Korean dishes, like calling tteokbokki \"chili rice gnocchi\" or calling kimchi fried rice \"paella\" or adding \"bourgignon\" to their galbi. It wasn't like they were serving some novel fusion food, the only Spanish thing about the paella is that it contains chorizo. I wonder if it's an attempt at making their food sound more European to seem fancier, and that's frankly kinda sad, especially since it seems to be Korean-owned. \n\nOverall, I would eat here again if it were convenient, but I wouldn't intentionally make a trip back just for this place. It's overpriced for what it is."

No wing left uncovered.  Crunchy and flavorful!  The only thing wrong with these wings is the fact that we didn't order more \n\nBut these spicy buns!!! Not too spicy at all, but the perfect amount of kick.  The pork was tender and not too fatty.

Just wrap the cheese around the spoon like a spool to get it into your mouth. \n\nThe chicken bibimbap has a nice mix of veggies: bean sprouts, carrots, kale, edamame, pea pods, red peppers.

Tables of people nearby were cheery with good discussions, a more raucous soju type table toward the back. Good vibe for solo dining or groups or couples! \n\nI asked my server what his favorite was and he recommended the bulgogi I though he said the bibimbap was most popular. No kidding, the safety of bibimbap ha. \n\nI ordered the banchan sampler and the bulgogi rice bowl. It came super quick, and it was so good. Like really excellent food, the quality was great.\n\nI'd characterize this as others have: beginner Korean. Sort of like, hipster fusion bar meets Korean food, but the right way to be 75% Korean restaurant expectation plus 25% contemporary hip restaurant. \n\nThe least expensive meal for me this week and arguably the best, the location is great and I will come again, particularly if I'm staying nearby but if it's the right time I'll trek over from center city (or grab a ride) too. \n\nReally, happy/pleased/surprised.

I recommend trying it and think most people will love it. \n\nSmall restaurant but very nicely decorated and clean. \n\nOnly tried three items on the menu so we will have to come back and try more, which we will!\n\nCame for lunch during the week and it was pretty quiet. \n\nHad the Korean fried chicken, japchae with bulgogi , and the galbi bourginione. \n\nThe Korean fried chicken was really good. Super crunchy and nicely seasoned with a yummy sweet chili sauce. \n\nJapchae was a little different than others I've had but good. It was a little more Chinese than Korean in flavor profile. Really nicely cooked noodles, with good veggies and a yummy beef topping. Only thing i felt it needed was a little sweetness...but after adding a lil Dollop of the sweet chili sauce from the chicken it was perfect. \n\nFinally the galbi bourginione. This was delicious! Not galbi like I've had in any Korean restaurant before. The chef clearly has some French training. This was like a French bourginione with melt in your mouth, unctuous short rib instead of braised chuck.  The beef was fall apart tender, gooey and wonderful. Nice mushrooms, onions and a little asparagus. Excellent dish. \n\nService was solid and the chef even came out to check on us and make sure we enjoyed which is a plus. \n\nOne small negative is that the Bonchon is all a la carte . That isn't appropriate at a Korean place. It should be free with the meal. \n\nA little more sweetness on the japchae and some complimentary Bonchon would make it five star and worthy of high praise. \n\nGood place overall for sure."

The japchae was actually annoyingly delicious, but there wasn't enough of it and I felt like for the price, they could have at least gave some more noodles.\n\nI was a little annoyed that they didn't do the traditional Korean way with free side dishes because who eats a meal without kimchi? That's like a meal with no rice. I GET it, I just don't think it was the best decision. I digress.\n\nThe green tea ice cream is NOT matcha, just a heads up.

The thing that made me give 3 stars is the food was really bland and didn't taste like traditional Korean food. I got the spicy pork bowl, fried chicken, bugolgi  all of which had no flavor. I was surprised because of the high ratings on this restaurant but oh well learned my lesson not fo trust Yelp reviews that much."

The food was more like a creative(fusion) Korean food, which I found it absolutely delicious. Customer service was also superb and the place was so clean and neat.\n\nLocated in Old City Philadelphia(the area is so so so beautiful!!!), it is a good spot to enjoy the rich culture of Philadelphia along with good foods:) Nearby there is a wine/spirit shop where you can buy drinks at reasonable price. So lovely an area full with rich traditions combined with modern innovative vibes."

        "text": "tl;dr behind the punk-modern aesthetic and Westernized-menu, this Old City BYOB  serves large platters of solid Korean fare\n\nEnter into a narrow, low-ceilinged hallway with dark wooden flooring. Two-seater tables are spaced evenly along the white subway-tiled wall and one side, while clear tubes of incandescent bulbs dangle above the staff prep area on the other. This corridor opens up into a large, cubical room. Tastefully melted candles and graffiti-style art decorate cubbies within the vast exposed brick walls, while an ornate metal chandelier hangs from the high, pressed-tin ceiling. A rust-red cushioned booth loops around the room, with a four-seater table pressed into each corner. Acoustic Korean music plays unobtrusively in the background. Take the steps down into the industrial basement to find the clean, unisex washrooms.\n\nDuring our visit this weekend, my partner and I opted for the Korean Fried Chicken (with Honey-soy), Tteok-bokki (stir-fried rice cakes), and Spicy Pork Skillet. The boneless, popcorn chicken-style KFC sported a light, crispy breading. The sauce itself was sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Although the nuggets were heavily sauced, they remained surprisingly crispy. The tteok bokki (described on the menu as \"gnocchi\") consisted of rice cakes, ramen noodles, and fish-sauce tofu, doused in a ketchup-y sweet-and-spicy sauce then sprinkled with mozzarella. I enjoyed the different textures and found the stringy cheese to be the highlight. However, the flavors became progressively one-dimensional as we ate our way through the large platter. The pork skillet had a large mound of meat, topped with a chili oil sauce. Unlike the tteok bokki chili sauce, this one was more umami and thicker in consistency. The spice pleasantly lingered on the tongue, rather than being overwhelmingly forward. The bonchon felt higher quality than peer restaurants. My favorite was the pickled eggplant. Nonetheless, I found it moderately offputting that they only come free if you order a skillet (and, even then, you receive a random 4 of the 6 possible options).\n\nService was memorably friendly and appropriately attentive. The restaurant was around half-capacity when we arrived but was full by the time we finished. The atmosphere and menu descriptions originally had me expecting Korean-American fusion cuisine, but the dishes were surprisingly authentic. The large-sized portions took me from ravenous to pleasantly full. At $52 (after tax and tip), Buk Chon definitely scales to Old City prices -- this is partially offset by their BYO policy. Although not every dish was a hit, this spot cooks up some solid Korean eats (something, for which, Philly is severely lacking). Buk Chon is definitely worthy of a return visit."

However, I give every restaurant a chance to prove me wrong and Buk Chon did not! \n\nFirst of all, ban chan (korean starter dishes) should always be free. It is ridiculous that'll it cost $3-6 for something that is free in most korean restaurants. I got it anyway to at least try it. The ban chan tasted to sweet and I probably won't be ordering it again.\n\nThe entree dishes and soups are decent. However, I still noticed that the entrees were overly sweet. The bulgogi was cooked well but I'm looking for more depth in korean fusion instead of what I got. Overall, the food was lackluster and I probably will not go back anytime soon."

The banchan were light and refreshing, the japchae was a cut above other japchae I've eaten, with a smoky flavor. \n\nI thought the staff was very considerate, attentive to filling our waters, okay with modifying the dishes (I asked for no pork in my kimchi fried rice), and generally very nice. \n\nOne note- the kimchi fried rice is a little spicier than you might imagine, so be cautious! Other than that, I'm very happy with this new find and will be back soon!"

The order came with banchan, packed in three condiment sauce cups, one of the saddest looking and most disappointing banchan I've ever had.\n\nThe tofu stew and the Jap-Chae were standard. The tofu stew could use a little more spice though."

This was for sure some of the best food I've had since I've lived in Philly."

He also gave us directions to a shop selling wine and beer. It was quicker and easier to just go next door :)\n\nThere is outdoor dining but we opted for indoor since they were taking all the recommended COVID precautions. The service was excellent - very helpful in answering questions and making recommendations. The Spicy Pork Buns are fantastic. We started with those and also got a green onion pancake. Beware - you might fill up on these things!  The quantity of food with our main courses was large - we all took leftovers home (even my mom and I as we were sharing the prime rib skillet). If you order extra spicy - know that it's VERY spicy - make you sweat kinda spicy...lol!  But very yummy!"

Awesome decor and peaceful vibe. Wait staff comes when necessary which create a smooth dining experience. Plus BYOB can't go wrong . Gave a 5 star because where we are from in NJ Korean restaurant do not cater to American diner's ..enjoy your visit"

The food is all at best mediocre (everything was super sweet), it does not taste authentically Korean, and I was appalled at their restroom sign.\n\nThe only thing we enjoyed here was the fried chicken appetizer and it's not that hard for fried chicken to taste good. The stew I ordered tasted under-seasoned and too sweet all at the same time. \n\nThe restaurant was a 3 star until I went to the bathroom. The bathroom sign suggests a \"man\" figure peeking in to a bathroom stall that a \"woman\" figure is using. If it's humor they aimed for they miserably failed. Way to promote crime."

I was born in Korea and grew up in Los Angeles, so I know a decent korean place when I try it. Everything we tried was yummy. We had bibimbap, kimchi fried rice, spicy rice cake, and bulgogi. If you are looking for good korean food I would highly recommend this place. Only thing I was surprised by was that they charge you for banchan (small dishes) as korean restaurant usually give them out for free (and free unlimited refills). We had to try it so we got the banchan tasting plate and everything was delicious! You won't be disappointed."

        "text": "Really, really great food! First, it's BYOB but there is a liquor store right nearby, so pretty easy to pop over there and grab some alcoholic beverages if that's your vibe. The restaurant was pleasantly busy but not overcrowded, so calling ahead is probably a good idea (we did so). We shared a couple of dishes at the table (mung bean pancakes and chili rice gnocchi) and both were delicious, although the chili rice gnocchi was out of this world. The sauce was spicy but not overly so, and it was just delicious.\n\nFor my entree, I asked our server to help me decide between the rib eye bulgogi and the fire chicken, and he recommended the former because it was my first time at the restaurant. In hindsight, I think he recommended the bulgogi because it wasn't super spicy like the chicken, and I'm definitely annoyed at myself for following his advice. It was very tasty, for sure, but I think the fire chicken would have been even better and more up my alley. So, when I go next time, I'm definitely going to grab the spicy chicken.\n\nMaybe the only negative about this place is that I did feel like the server was kind of absent for most of the meal. He didn't do a great job of refilling our water and our card sat there for a long while before he picked it up. Granted, the food was good enough that we'll definitely be back, but I would have preferred a little more attentiveness.\n\nAnyway, in general, big thumbs up for this place!"

I highly recommend this place, the ribeye bulgogi is absolutely superb and the Kim chi paella is among the best I've ever had.

I didn't have high expectations and overall I was not impressed. \n\nLet's start off with the good the chicken appetizer was probably worth 4/5 stars for being boneless chicken. They were cut in little nugget sizes, fried nice and crispy, and the sauce was not too salty but needed more spice. \n\nFor my meal I got the bibimbap with beef. Presentation was nice but the flavor was just lacking. Thankfully they give you a whole bottle of the gochujang sauce so I added plenty to get by. The sauce itself was too sweet and needed a lot more of a kick."

We grabbed a bottle of wine at a store down the street. It was a weeknight so it was quiet, We spent 2 hours here just chatting and enjoying our food/bottle of wine. We decided to share a few appetizers as our meal since the entrees lacked many pescatarian options for my partner. The service was good - and overall the food was tasty. I really liked the Korean Fried Chicken and the bonchon. My husband loved the chili rice gnocchi- I thought it was an interesting take on a Italian/Korean dish, but I found it a little too spicy to have more than a few bites. The japchae was so-so as the seafood included seemed to be low quality frozen stuff. I would skip the seafood next time and just eat the tasty noodles. The check was well priced, especially for the area. I would come back and spend another weeknight here - it's a good spot for a leisurely chill date ;)"
