Everything was sooooo good and it was fun grilling the meats to our desired liking. We also had two bottles of Korean rice wine Shoju I believe it was called and it was like a light vodka, very smooth. The service was so exceptional as well. We enjoyed it very much!"

The server recommended the Korean bbq for 2 for $70 because that would be the best value. The course includes korean side dishes, miso soup, steamed eggs, Tempura, salad with ginger dressing, bibimbap and 6 different variety of meats. The serving sizes were more than enough. The servers were also very friendly and stopped by every few minutes to check up on us. They even offered us complimentary alcoholic drinks on the house."

It's located in a pretty miserable strip mall, but the parking is plentiful and the interior makes up for the outside. The whole place feels newly renovated, and the tables are clean.\n\nWe ordered the course for 6 people, and we were stuffed by the end of it. The course comes with broiled egg, jeon (assorted fried fish and veggies), two stone bibimbaps, etc. Everyone also gets their own soup, salad, and dipping sauces. \n\nAs for the meats, they give you a lot and they are good quality. Surprisingly, the spicy chicken was my favorite! My sisters loved the beef galbi they give you in the beginning. There was enough meat for everyone, and we even had some leftovers. However, a group of six HUNGRY men or athletes might need to order more.\n\nThe staff was really attentive, and the waiters cook and cut the meat for you. They also told us what the meats were as they cooked them. The staff was nice and held the door open as we left! Overall, I would make the hour drive to eat here again!"

Literally when we want to order stuff no one came to ask we literally have to call them. After food was on the table the waiter became completely \"blind\". They are just walking around back and forth doing nothing. When there's some dirty plates on our table the waiter literally just took a peek and than walk away. Also when they finally realized that there's a table of customers next to them, they finally did something but after they put the barbecue into the grill the waiter put the tongs and scissors on the f**king dirty table:). (Plus no one will change the barbecue net for you, they will just put all beef, chicken, and seafood on one net). What a nice service. This is a great place to go if you want to cook the barbecue and wipe the table by yourself. Totally welcome to come if you guys wanted to have a \"new experience\" of self servicing. ;)"

There's still some time left until closing and it takes what, 1-2 minutes to clean our table? It's also your job to work UNTIL CLOSING.

However, after reading the listing, I was impressed with the selection offered and figured the worse than might be done with this special would be a trade off of volume for variety.\n\nFor $75, you get the standard banchan, two miso soups, two salads, a tempura basket, hot egg dish, veggies to grill, and a whole lot of meat! The meat covers their beef and pork offerings, but does not include any fish.  I'm guessing the portion of each meat is smaller than an \u00e0 la carte order. \n\nTo the potential portion concern, it was not a concern.  We left full with a small take home bag.  The banchan is amazing and unlimited if you aren't quite full.  Likewise, you can also add on some meat if you want more.\n\nAs for quality, well damn I was impressed. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage, but beyond that we were fighting for each piece.  The pork belly or bulgogi were the overall winners in my mind.\n\nTo wrap things up, my own regret was not bringing more people in the party to try more dishes.

The set menus offer a variety of authentic Korean meat and vegetable side dishes. Their Galbi and soondubu (spicy soft tofu) soup are especially excellent, and I always order the kimchi pancake as an appetizer.  I do travel an hour to get to this place, but it's always worth it.  Went to this place 4 times these past 2-3 months for their amazing Korean bbq!"

The complimentary side dishes that are traditional to Korean restaurants were particularly impressive here as well. \n\nEverything was delicious but if I had to narrow down the best, I would go with the short rib, pork belly and grilled calamari. \n\nThe restaurant is brand new so the ventilation system of the grill almost completely removes any smoke and limits odor from the food catching onto your clothes. \n\nLast but not least, the menu is very well priced and the portions are huge so I definitely plan on coming back with a larger group."

However, restaurants like DuBu in Elkins Park and So Korean Grill in Olney (of all places) have ignited my taste buds for Korean like one of Rocket Man's missiles to the North. The dishes are uniquely flavorful and prolific, and the service is amazingly efficient. It all adds up to a wonderful culinary experience and a great value, on top of it all. Just make sure to bring an equally prolific appetite, because the panoply of dishes are endless!"

We got the SET A BBQ combo for 2 and the mulnengmyun (soup cold noodles) to share. It wasn't very good. More than half of the meat that was got was too tough and very hard to chew. Only the pork belly was somewhat okay. The cold noodles tasted bland and nothing like authentic Korean cold noodles should be. Most likely not going back again..."

Then the owner came up after giving us a side look and asked if that is all we will eat. I said yes, we are not hungry rn to which she said that she's making an exception but we must order the entree in order to be there. I asked her if that is a rule and she said no, but that's what she wants. After giving us multiple side looks and talking about us we finally left. Very disappointed. Not coming back.

The quality of meat is good, and I love the side dishes they offered. \n\nThe waiter was super nice and accommodating. They regularly checked on you and helped you grill the meat. \n\nThe atmosphere is very modern but still cozy. The restaurant is very new so I love how I did not smell like bbq food on me. \n\nI will definitely come back here again."

The set comes with miso soup, salad, tempura basket, bibimbap as some of the starter's items. As for the bbq meats, the set includes pork ribs, pork belly, sirloin, bulgogi, and sausages as well as others meats. I have to say, the set did make me full and I also didn't feel overwhelmed with the food, just enough to have a good balance of the various food items. The services are always very good.

Everything was very good, but next time will probably skip the premium galbi as the difference was not worth the extra cost vs. la galbi. \n\nAlso had dduk guk, kimchi jjigae, mul naeng myun -- all very good. Especially the mul naeng myun. Dduk guk had really nice tender meat and tasty broth. \n\nIf you eat a lot, it can get a bit expensive. But you can definitely tell that you get what you pay for as the quality of meat here is much better than other places that offer \"AYCE\" style KBBQ."

Best of all, I didn't walk out smelling like I was marinated in smoke. My husband and I shared the the premium galbi, pork belly and cold buckwheat noodles. The beef and pork were cooked perfectly at the table. The quality of the meat is definitely higher than other places that I've been to in the area. The pork belly came in a thicker cut which helps retain a lot of the juices once it's cooked. This will be my new go-to spot for Korean bbq in Philly!"

If you go there really hungry, perhaps your party can finish the set designated for the number of persons in your party.\n\nOur set included different cuts of pork, including pork belly, sausage, different cuts of beef, chicken, shrimp, squid; a variety of kimchi; vegetables; salad and miso soup. It was a LOT of food.\n\nFor the most part, all of the proteins were tender and quite tasty. The kimchis were all excellent. The miso soup was unexpectedly good. The side salad was just filler. \n\nStaff set the grill temperature and assisted with cooking, as needed. When we turned up the grill to hasten cooking, a staff member came by and flipped it back to her setting. Lol. \n\nThe beauty of this place is that there is plenty of time for good conversation and noshing on the side dishes, while the food is grilling.\n\nThere is a return in my future, hopefully with a lot of greens in the interim to prepare for all of that protein.\n\n4.5 stars"

The menu is quite extensive and offers set menus for 2, 4, etc but we ultimately opted to order meats a la carte. The marinated ribs were the crowd favorite and what I would definitely order again. Service was also attentive and they did a good job keeping an eye on our meats but giving us space at the same time. \n\nNext time the Korean BBQ craving hits, this will be my place!"
