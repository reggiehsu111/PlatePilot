I have not been blown away by anything, and the flavors of the dishes I have sampled (Chicken Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Mumbia Dal, and Navratan Korma) were fairly muted.  They also tout that the food is prepared without butter or ghee.  Um - I am not sure this is a good thing.  I enjoy the richness of Indian food; if I want light, I'll get a salad or something Mediterranean. The mumbai dal (a lentil dish) was so saucy and skimpy on the lentils that it might as well have been a broth-based soup.\n\nIn spite of my gripes, I do expect I will go back to Mumbai Bistro.  They fill a void for low-key, inexpensive Indian takeout in the immediate neighborhood.  They have a few tables set up to eat it, but it looks like their primary business is simple take-out.  The food (while somewhat uninspired) was all cooked well, and seemed fresh and hot in the buffet.  The space is clean, and the staff have all been friendly.  The idea of \"lighter\" Indian fare is not a bad one, but I would love to see them amp up their flavor a bit."

The food is great and tastes much healthier than the other Indian restaurants I've been to in the past. There are some really great vegan choices and everything is marked on the menu as well. \n\nI really like that you can go on their website and order food for very quick delivery. I only eaten inside the restaurant once and thought it was good. I think Mumbai is more useful for delivery as the place has a fast-food feel. \n\nI would definitely recommend Mumbai Bistro!"

If you're on a budget like me, this is perfect.\n2) Simple, easy-to-understand menu. It also tells you what's spicy, what's gluten free, what contains dairy.\n3) Fast service. Even if you don't call in and order ahead for take-out, they get your to-go order ready in 5-10 mins.\n4) The food taste and quality is good. Good selection of appetizers and entrees.

Not a plus, but not at all the delivery guy's fault.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala with basmati rice and the gulab jamun for dessert. The chicken was well-cooked, tender, and probably had decent flavor. I say \"probably\", because the whole thing was so incredibly watery. I think they didn't use any yogurt or corn starch. Still, not the worst I've had (that prize goes to Nanee's Kitchen at Reading Terminal). The chicken wasn't really that bad and I still had dessert to look forward to. Nope. Instead of the sweet, spongey goodness usually associated with gulab jamun, it was hard and a little gritty.\n\nI could overlook the quality of the food if it was at least cheap, but it's not really that much cheaper than other places.\n\nDefinitely not a place to introduce someone to Indian cuisine if they've never had."

        "text": "I'm a little puzzled by all the rave reviews for this place. Don't get me wrong, I still continue to go here despite the \"meh\" food, but the attractiveness of Mumbai Bistro lies nearly entirely in the location and the price (which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1).\n\nI am definitely glad that there is place in walking distance from both Jefferson and Pennsylvania hospital that serves ready-made Indian food I can grab on my lunch break. The standard hospital cafeteria fare can grow old quickly, and I often fantasize about a delicious curry when I contemplate grabbing something predictable from the hospital cafe. \n\nAnd I suppose it's a smart business strategy to serve Indian food that is palatable to pickier eaters or people who don't normally enjoy spicy cuisine, but for someone like me who loves Indian food for its vibrant and complex flavors, the food served here is a bland facsimile of familiar favorites. The malai kofta and the mixed vegetable curry are probably the best meatless dishes served here, but even those lack the expected richness and texture. The Gobi Malasa tends to be overcooked and mushy and the paneer masala is downright watery. The naan is somewhat soggy and seems like it has been microwaved.\n\nI don't like giving bad reviews, and I want this place to remain in business, but I think there are some very easy fixes they could do to improve the food here, namely not watering down dishes and not using a microwave to heat up naan. I think it is great that they do not use butter or ghee, but I've also made vegan Indian food in my own home that was more flavorful than this, so I don't find the health claims to be a valid excuse for blandness. I think the concept of a cheap vegan & celiac-friendly buffet that is 5$ a pound is a fantastic idea, but I don't think that it should come at the cost of flavor and consistency.\n\nIf you work close by and you're really craving some cheap and fast Indian food that meets your dietary restrictions, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to come here, but if you have your choice of Indian restaurants, I'd definitely recommend choosing a different one."

However, it doesn't come out as cheap as you would imagine. $7-12 for lunch plus tax. They don't give you much naan for the price, and it's usually not fresh.\n\nI do like the chai and chicken samosas. The chicken samosas are really big, 3 of them, and very filling for $4.

The selection is a little limited in that they do not serve meat aside from chicken, but what they do have they do very well. Plus, I like that it's probably a little healthier without all the butter."

Due to the fact its janamastmi hubby n I were vegetarian for the weekend.  \n\nCame into the restaurant n there was a talk Punjabi man who was cleaning the buffet area. He didnt greet us til we sat down. I asked for paneer tikka masala just instead of paneer masala. He instantly said no. Hubby and i ordered navratan masala and paneer masal and two whole wheat rotis. I saw that he was Punjabi, I had no doubt in my mind the food would be chat pata (spicy). The food was brought out in 10 ounce plastic containers, rotis were in individual foil paper and they were reallll thick rotis. My mom would've kicked the @$$ of the persi n who made rtve rotis. Anyway the entrees tasted exactly rhe same and it was sweeter than most Gujarati food I've tried. I askes for a green chilli they gave me achar. A white man walks in n he was greeted instantly.  Really Punjabi man? Anytime we asked him for something, he had the ched type of guy cone out n give it to us...how dare he move. Not worth the walk. I should've went to Minar instead"

More affordable than any other Indian restaurant i have gone to. Of course, the food is not the greatest, but it's never totally disappointing either.\nHaving said that, I don't think i would order chicken biryani again. It's not basmati rice, and the taste is simply not authentic biryani.\nThe chicken curry had a pool of oil floating at the top -- not very healthy. But the chicken was perfectly tender.\nThe tandoori chicken appetizer was good, but it does contain red food coloring.\nI do like this restaurant -- it's clean, cozy, quick, affordable, and has a simple menu with gluten or lactose-free labels."

I appreciated the vegetarian options, although I'm not a strict vegetarian, simply because I wasn't pigeonholed into getting the typical chicken. It was expediently made, and that's more than I can say for most places with such a cheap menu, but the masala was really watery and super safe as far as spices go.  The naan was definitely microwaved.  Don't expect all of the lesser-known dishes, but you can count on the old favorites.  All in all, it's a great place to visit if you're looking for cuisine that's quick and yummy (think fast-food Indian), but maybe not if you're looking for traditional, homestyle Indian."

I would recommend this place only if the group is small and do not care about the ambiance as much as the taste of the food. The menu is very limited for the buffet. The price is per pound of food you take. If you are super hungry, 1.5 pounds of food will be perfect for you. Bread is extra. Overall - great food, hole in the wall."

I congratulate it for tapping this market! \n\nThere is a hot bar with daily meat and veg courses that rotate- stocked with all your standards...chicken tikka masala, paneer masala, chicken korma, some lentil dishes, potato and cauliflower curry.  All these hot bar items were pretty fresh. \n\nThat being said, the quality of the dishes isn't quite Palace of the Ben worthy and they don't make their own naan (it's sorta weak).  My favorite offering was the Chicken Korma- avoid the dry Chicken Tikka Masala.  As far as Indian food goes, it's a little on the safer side with the spices pretty muted.  You also have to remember that for lunch (depending on how much you load in your to-go box) you could pay just a few bucks more and get an all you can eat buffet at Palace of the Ben with amazing naan and dessert included in the cost.\n\nAs I said above though, the ability to get pay-by-the pound Indian food in the neighborhood is pretty freakin' sweet for lunch!"

They avoid the potential pitfall of inadequate heating on the buffet line, and for an additional buck, you can add a side of naan. \n\nI have frequently pointed people in Mumbai's direction not only because of the food quality, but also because of the unbeatable prices. Not to be the eternal pessimist, but this is not the best Indian food in Philly. It's the best price, without question, and the service is always friendly; however, there are some other options worth considering if you want top-notch Tikka Masala and other Westernized curry dishes. \n\nMumbai Bistro is definitely deserving of a 4-star review and while there may be nicer Indian restaurants in the city, few could compete with its accessibility.

One day while passing by I decided to stop in for a veggie samosa and recognized one of the staff from New Delhi in University City.  I was happy to learn that in fact, Mumbai Bistro was affiliated with New Delhi.  Hearing this, I decided I had to return for dinner. \n\nSince that brief visit, I have been back numerous times  - so very happy to have another quick, inexpensive dinner option in my neighborhood & another good Indian option at that!  The menu lists the schedule of what is going to be served in the buffet each night, so I know what to expect and the food has been fresh and delicious every time we have stopped in.  The dishes rotate every day- a few meat dishes and mostly veggie dishes here.  If you have been to New Delhi then you know what to expect in terms of the food.  As the dishes in the buffet aren't super spicy, they will also throw in extra hot sauce if you ask. \n\nThe only problem we had with the food here is the Nan- it reminded us of the store bought kind you can get at whole foods and it usually ends up soggy by the time we arrive at home.  Because good Nan is such an essential element of Indian food, I have to deduct a start for that.  However, if the Nan improved, I would definitely rate Mumbai Bistro 4 stars. \n\nAlso of note- the staff here is always very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant is always clean.  The majority of customers here opt for takeout, however, there are a few tables in the restaurant so there is the option of eating in. Overall, a welcome addition to the neighborhood!"

Only thing is, it's so cheap and delicious, you might want to go back for seconds. $3 for two pieces of tandoori chicken and $1 naans are a steal compared to other places.\n\nFirst time trying malai kofta curry, loved it! Who knew little balls of spinach and potato could be so good. The chicken in the chicken tikka masala was still juicy and tender, and the actual curry broth was addictive. If you like cheese, the paneer masala was excellent, as well. The mumbai dal was probably the blandest out of the curries I had, but it tasted like exactly what it was supposed to: lentil bean curry.\n\nIt's pretty small, though, so either plan for takeout or don't bring too many people.

I thought the chicken and veg. malai kofta were really good but the veg curry was just so-so.  \n\nI'm not a fan of spicy food so if I go back I'll have to ease up on the sauces.  However, if you like spicy food, they do offer free hot sauce.  \n\nIf you're in the mood for quick, cheap Indian food, Mumbai will hit the spot."

I don't think I've had a Saag that has literally been served with a layer of liquid on top. The Masalas were like indian soups. The flavor was pretty good, but the chicken was dry and the paneer wasn't very soft. Delivery was speedy. You get a lot of Curry for the price. So if you are new to Indian food you probably won't mind the lack of quality. However, if you are quite experienced with the cuisine as I am then I suggest trying another restaurant in the city. I give the taste 1 star, but because it was very very affordable. I gave them another star. I don't ever award stars for service (but the delivery was fast and the driver was pleasant), so the rating stays at 2 stars."

We then invited our friends to drive from Germantown to meet up with us for dinner.\n\nWhen we arrived it was A LOT smaller and more casual than we were expecting.  Essentially it is Indian fast-food.  There are only about 6 small tables and a buffet of about 6 options.  We called in advance to make sure that it was BYOB and they assured us that it was, however, I think we may have been the only people in Mumbai Bistro history to take them up on that.  We felt a little silly downing our two bottles of wine in plastic cups while the only other patrons (a couple with two young children) eyed us suspiciously.\n\nWith that being said, the food was incredibly tasty and cheap.  My entire meal including Nan and drink was around $5.  It's neat the way they set it up where you weigh out your food from the buffet.  That way you get a range of options to choose from but don't have to pay a hefty buffet cost.  The saag paneeer was my favorite of the buffet dishes.  If there is something specific you like, the a la carte prices were also incredibly reasonable.\n\nThis place is truly awesome!  I wish they had one in my neighborhood!!"

When I go out for Indian food, taste is what I am looking for above all else. Other people may really like this place since they are gluten/butter/ghee free. I'm just not one of them. \n\nI can't really comment on the service because you serve yourself here. The best thing about this place is that it's consistent and managed well, but other than that, I can't say that this place really impresses me.\n\nWhen it comes to Indian food there are a huge number of recipes for any one dish.

The menu changes everyday and today we were greeted by four vegetarian dishes and two chicken dishes. My problems with the place is as follows:\n\n1. The location used to be a sushi place and it was relatively cool (temperature-wise), now that they are an Indian restaurant with a hot food kitchen in the open and a hot bath setting to keep the food hot. That place is a sauna, the ventilation is non-existent and eating inside is quite insufferable. \n\n2. Six items today, four of them are vegetarian, three of them are masalas that taste very much alike. By the time I get to the chicken masala, there were only two cubes of chicken left and I was forced to just get one cube so my friend can have some. Of the twenty minutes we were inside, they didn't think to replenish the food, so I guess customers who came after us won't get a taste.\n\n3. We got each a light plate, two sodas, two chutneys and shared one slice of onion naan and it cost us $19. With the selection so few and every item cost extra, you might as well pay a few more bucks and walk two more blocks to the larger all-you-can-eat buffets. \n\nThe food didn't taste bad, in fact it's nicely spiced but the heat is just too uncomfortable (maybe I wouldn't complain as much when its cold out), the value was just not good enough to make me go back unless I was famished and I'm too lazy to walk the two blocks then I might go back for take out."

The whole concept is to deliver fresh meals on a budget, and I believe delivering on a wholesome food promise without putting a dent on my wallet is a healthy proposition.\n\nThe is no d\u00e9cor per se, a small dining area if u want to eat in, and a fridge loaded wid goodies and ofcourse the buffet line complete the place. One of owners, Kyle manned the register and he patiently explained about the 4.95$ per pound of food,  the daily rotating food menu, the vegan and the lactose free menu items. The service is absolutely fantabulous and very welcoming.  \n\nIt is funny that I couldn't picture how much a single pound of food would look like, and I was pleasantly surprised to fill most of the plastic container with about a scoop of most things and a couple scoops each of my favs, all in 1.5 pounds. I am not a big fan of the buffet line, just cos I generally hog tooo much and am rendered useless for most of the afternoon but  this blows that theory out of the pond.\n\nThe menu changes daily, and includes fan favorites like chicken tikka and paneer masala, but there are also some of the more homely dishes like saag paneer (spinach / mustard leaf gravy) and aloo gobi ( potatoes and cauliflower ) which hold more appeal to me. I felt some of the curries were a bit bland, but nothing too bad. Only the entrees are lined on the buffet, but not the rice, breads and the appetizers, so that's an extra as u complete the meal. U can pick one of the lassi or mango drinks from the cooler to fight the heat and a dessert to seal the deal.\n\nSo if it is gluttony on the cheap u are looking for, this might not be the best bet. But if u want curries , kormas and vegetables to taste the way they intend to and not like overused baking soda u have chosen wisely my friends. Very Wisely.\n\nCheers"

I like the rotating menu and that the food always looks and tastes freshly prepared. Also, the prices are way more reasonable than you will find at any of the other Indian places in the area. I also really appreciate that they take cards and don't require a minimum purchase. Meatless options dominate the weekly rotating menu but i don't mind. The paneer masala is a particular favorite of mine. \n\nThere are only a couple of problems with Mumbai Bistro. The first is the size of the shop. It's really tiny with just a handful of tables. Dining in is usually not an option and you certainly can't go there for lunch with a group. The second little issue is that the naan is the kind you get frozen in bags at the grocery store. I understand that making fresh naan all day can be impractical for such a small operation, but i have to say i'd prefer it. I'd also prefer a freshly prepared mango lassi over the bottled ones they carry.\n\nDon't get me wrong, im just pointing out the drawbacks. I certainly recommend this place over any other lunch i can get in the area. The service is fast and friendly. The food is delicious. I set up my takeout with the same naan and mango lassi I was just \"complaining\" about so that shows how much i care about that."

I always thought I hated indian food so I went here with a co-worker to give it another try. It's probably super americanized, but I don't care. This stuff is amazing. For $5/lb you can mix and match whatever you want from 5 daily rotating items. Recommended: mali kofta and chicken vindaloo. Don't forget the naan, the onion is delicious and has spices (cilantro?) in it. Since it's help yourself, I always get too much food but I never spend more than $9, and I am full for at least 5 or 6 hours after. They also have a frequent visitor card which I obviously have, 1 free pound for every 8 or 10 you buy."

For $5.49/lb., the deal is tough to beat in center city.  \n\nI ordered takeout, but there are 3 or 4 tables for dining in.  They also have a more extensive menu, but I opted for the buffet.\n\nWhile the food wasn't piping hot, all but the black dal dish were exceptionally tasty.  6 out of the 8 options were veg-friendly, and of those  2-3 were vegan.

It's tucked into a cozy corner in the Gayborhood and is surrounded by a number of other homey local businesses and boutiques.\n\nWhen I first came in, I noticed that their buffet options were a little limited, and I was feeling a little picky. Saag Paneer (minced spinach and cheese cubes with spices) is one of my favorite Indian dishes, and I was a little bummed that it wasn't available at the buffet (which is super cheap--$5.25/lb!), but ordering it as an entr\u00e9e would have been a great economical option too, at only $4.75. The dishes available at the buffet were still great, though! I got both the Chicken Tikka Masala and its paneer counterpart, and they were flavorful and went well with rice. Their Gobi Masala (cauliflower and potatoes with spices), in my opinion, was the best thing I had there. It had a slight kick to it, but overall it had a good texture, was filling, and was definitely healthy and fresh. I also had a mango lassi, which was surprisingly creamy and a fresh way to round off a rich meal.\n\nThey don't use butter or ghee, and the vegetable oil they use to cook has 0% trans fat. Something great and healthy to keep in mind!\n\nOverall, the food was filling, healthy, and pleasantly affordable. I'll definitely be back!"

I think I've now found a new favorite takeout place.\n\nThe food was really good, particularly for takeout and you could taste that their claims of using fresh natural ingredients are true. The interior was very clean and well designed for such a small space with a food bar. The selection was well curated, which I appreciated because I am overwhelmed by food bars that are too big. I loved the prominent Gluten Free and Vegan labeling of all of the dishes. And, when we paid at the register I was shocked by how cheap everything was. I definitely have a new detour from the Whole Foods Salad Bar a few blocks away on South St. \n\nNote: As someone slightly neurotic about cleanliness, I thought that everything here felt super clean. Another reviewer noted that they thought they got food poisoning here because they were sick the night they had dinner here. Generally food poisoning (particularly from meat) takes at least 12 hours to develop (but we all tend to blame the last thing we ate) so this place may not have been responsible, but something eaten earlier in the day . . . just a thought."

Finally after a little encouragement from friends, I got over my hesitations, and finally tried out this place. If you are unfamiliar with Indian food, this is the right place to come try it out. The buffet holds many options with very clear descriptions of what it contains and how spicy it is. I can't really tell you what I got other than the chicken masala, dal, and a couple of vegetable things. They were all REALLY good, but extremely salty (is Indian food always like that? I have no idea). I ordered garlic naan on the side because carbs are carbs, and its hard to mess up a good thing. \n\nI would say that I brought home the plastic container and placed it in my fridge because I wasn't hungry yet, but then I didn't feel like microwaving the plastic later on was a good move, so I microwaved it on a plate. A lot of the things got mixed together. While that was not a bad thing flavor wise, it just left me with even more confusion over what I just ate, so I would advise dining in (its so nice inside!) or eating immediately when you get home. \n\nI need to mention that I have a SERIOUS hesitance to buffets. Like, I refuse to eat at them. This restaurant is so clean, well maintained and modern that I did not have any reservations.

Reasonably, the quantity of food that is provided is on the skimpier end. If you're particularly famished, might I suggest ordering a few sides but good luck because your options are either rice, naan, or $0.50 dressing container of raita or a $0.75 container of pickled vegetables. \n\nDue to my binge eating tendencies and the dreaded delivery minimum I went with 2 of each of the sides and a saag paneer for myself and chicken curry for my main bish. \n\nGood news is that delivery via caviar is quick and painless. Food arrived in 30 min or less, just as promised. Food arrived actually even earlier than my friend lol. \n\nImmediately I noticed that my \"saag paneer\" was actually some paneer cubes with a touch of spinach and bowl of cooked onion slices. Literally I've seen french onion soup with less fucking onions in it. It was absolutely fucking vile and I couldn't eat it. If you love onions, good for you but this was repulsive to me as I hate those evil shit pieces. I literally just ate like 4-5 paneer cubes and had to throw the rest out. For the love of god I know Indian food has onions but they're usually like ground/diced and cooked down so much it doesn't bother me and I barely notice it. It seemed like they didn't feel like putting anything else besides onions in there. The flavor itself without the onions wasn't that great either, I've def had better indian food in Philly. \n\nThe pickled vegetables were the weirdest fucking flavor of shit I've ever tried. For one, I had no idea what the vegetable was. Secondly there was an odd sourness combined with a lot of heat. I couldn't eat this either.\n\nThe raita was good. I wish i had ordered more of it.

You get a decent bit of food too for what you order and it's easy enough to order two entrees for what would normally be the price of one elsewhere. The most reliable of these is the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chicken Makhni. I stick to these two now when I order because...\n\nThere's a lot of really weird, off-color flavors in some of the dishes. The chicken vindaloo I've gotten has been really oily and the flavors of most of the other curries, while alright, are definitely not the most \"authentic\" Indian that I've had. The lamb has been especially disappointing when I've ordered it: chewy sometimes, rubbery other times, and usually filled with lots of bone pieces everywhere. Avoid if you can. Even the mint and tamarind chutney of all things tastes off and isn't worth ordering. \n\nThe naan is okay--filling enough and alright for the price, but nothing to write home about. If you stick to one piece of naan per entree and order two entrees, you can order a nice full meal with 2 breads and 2 meats for the price of 1 meat and 1 bread at other places.

Lynn also had masala chai as a drink.  THe food was fresh and excellently prepared.  We were disappointed that the ras mulai dessert was not available.  However, this venue is well worth the price.  Seating is limited, so it would be wise to come before or after noon.  Also, the staff is small so be prepared to wait a while for your food.    If you in the area and enjoy good Indian food, this would be a great \"fast food\" kind of place except that it is not fast."

It is also reasonably priced.  \n\nThe food there is not going to be what most people are used to.  Most people are used to a very heavy creamy taste to Indian food.  That is because many restaurants use cream to make the base of the curry.  That is not authentic, very unhealthy,  and gives you terrible food coma; contrary to some of the reviews I saw. \n\nThe curry at this place is much closer to homemade curry and is going to be lighter. \n\nBecause it did not quite hit the spice level i like, I gave them 4 stars,  although I did have buffet and not made to order."

For under $8, i can get a whole plate full of Indian food, and a piece of naan and be completely satisfied.\n\nThe buffet is the best deal in Washington Square West. At $4.95/lb you can load up on rice and a variety of main dishes, including multiple vegetarian and vegan choices (tip: the vegetarian stuff is lighter, so your lunch will cost less). The buffet is always moving, so you can be in and out and back to work in 10 minutes, if you work close by. I really like the masala and lentil dishes best, but I am always open to trying whatever is available. As a member of the frequent buyer program, I have already received a free pound of food already. Working on card #2 now.\n\nTo top off the already perfect lunch spot, the guys that work here are NICE. Really, really nice people."

I know what good Indian food is. Until someone can tell me otherwise, I'm going to stick with what I know.\n\nWhat makes it good? Aside from its departure from the heat Indian food might usually pack, this place makes authentic cuisine. Don't worry... they have a delicious chicken tikka masala for all of you who order it.\n\nThe Saag Paneer is excellent (spinach and cubes of cheese) , as are the lamb samosas. I'm not a huge fan of the veggie samosa though - it's dry and kind of bland. Last time I ordered the chicken vindaloo which was very good as well. Great naan options (onion is my favorite).  \n\nIf you're looking to dine in, this place offers a very small, cozy dining room. I'd recommend taking out or delivery (there is a 6 or 7 dollar charge, since it's through a third party service). They don't accept delivery orders over the phone, but don't let that stop you.\n\nI hope they start making kathi rolls (Mumbai Bistro, if you're reading this, then take that as a plea!).\n\nRemember this the next time you're looking for Indian food. Over and out."

The vindaloo had way too much flavor in it, it was a tell that they recooked it with spices! Their naan portions are small so I would suggest to order extra if you're with a group.

Greed is happy because I have saved money.\n\nThat being said, envy, pride, and lust cannot be counted on to be fulfilled at this establishment.\n\nas for the food...\n\nIf you like New Dehli, you will like Mumbai Bistro because they both share the same head chef.  Seriously, I could smell the similarities in the food as I walked into the establishment.  My suspicions were confirmed when I recognized the guy at the register as a waiter from New Dehli.\n\nToe-to-toe, none of their selections beat similar dishes at other Indian restaurants(Sitar, Palace at the Ben, Karma)...but they are not beat by a large margin.  Also, Mumbai Bistro is much, much cheaper.  \n\nI recommend going in and just piling on a spoonful of everything they've got on your plate, paying like 5 bucks, and stuffing yourself silly.\n\nThis place is perfect for a meal on a budget and a time crunch.

They pride themselves on cooking healthy Indian food, with vegan and gluten free options. Probably the reason the food seemed to be missing something. Hard to pinpoint, but the food just isn't quite on the mark (not spicy enough, missing spices, etc..) and the menu is very limited. For example, no lamb curry on the menu, in fact the only lamb dish they had was available at the buffet. Never been to an Indian restaurant that did not have an ample selection of lamb on the menu. The gulab jamun was also not right. The syrup seemed to be lite and the balls seemed to be missing the ghee. Overall the place is bright and clean, the service good and friendly."

Not mixed, not really light skinned African American - Indian as in FROM INDIA.  Well, not me, but my parents.  Anywho, as a result of being Indian, I consider myself something of an expert on Indian food. I mean I have had it OFTEN.  Most of my life in fact.  And it's of course my fav cuisine in the whole wide world.  So when I read about Mumbai Bistro on Foobooz, I naturally wanted to go there instantly.  \n\nMumbai Bistro is interesting. I give it 4 stars - mostly b/c it's so cheap.  And the concept is neat - food per pound! I can't even eat a whole pound of food - no matter what I do. So for me it works out well. \nAdditionally, they label all their food for people with dietary restrictions - vegan, lactose free, spicy, etc.  Additionally, their menu changes often, and the things like raita, chutney's, pickles, lassi's, naan, and samosa's are extra. \n\nThe samosa was okay, the outer shell was great, but the filling was subpar.  The rice was well cooked. The naan was not that great - it was pretty much roghani naan from the grocery store.  The channa I had was also only okay, not great.  \n\nHOWEVER me and my companion ate for $16 - and we each got samosa, naan, rice, etc.  AND my dinner companion had meat! \n\nAddittionally, it's BYOB, which is always fun. \n\nDefinitely eat here if you are around - but if  you have the chance to choose Indian food - go to Ekta or Tiffin."

The only complaint is the wasteful use of plastic for dine in customers.

There are tables to sit at inside, but they have a buffet that is really popular, especially at lunch time. I usually go and pick up from the buffet, but they have a much wider selection on their menu and that food is also excellent. \n\nThey are closed on Mondays, so keep that in mind. Be sure to get their rewards card which they stamp each time you go - after 10 stamps you get up to 1lb of food free. \n\nNote: in order to cash in your free meal, you must choose food from the buffet. I made the mistake once of ordering food off of the menu and then having to pay full price because the voucher was only for up to 1lb of food from the buffet. It was frustrating to find that out at the register (that rule was not clearly stated on the rewards card), so I say that here to give you a heads up. \n\nOverall, it's a great place!"

The buffet style gives you the opportunity to load up or take it easy, depending on the day.  The naan comes out  hot and they do a good job of keeping the buffet trays fresh.  For beverages, there is a delicious yogurt lassi (mango is my favorite) that just tops off a great, modest-priced meal.  The guys working the place are very friendly and as an added bonus, they give you a card that you can stamp each time you visit.  After 10 visits, you get 1 free pound.   \n\nWhat I don't like: Its a little small so getting a table is tough if you go around 12-12:30pm.  Be prepared to get \"to go\" if you plan to eat around then.\n\nRecommendation:  Go at 11:30am when it opens or around 1:30pm- after the lunch rush hour.

The idea of by the weight buffet Indian food is amazing because, especially with Indian food, just one curry is beyond boring. \n\nThis place is $5.50/lb I'm pretty sure which is enough to fill a standard to-go box and spend roughly $7 I'd say. Garlic naan $1.50 and raita $0.75. Good price!\n\nI had the saag paneer and the navaratan koorma. Both were made properly with good spices. Sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many places in Philly seem to not know how to make a saag paneer which is so basic. \n\nWhat made me really like this place though was that their paneer was really paneer! All these Indian places these days are using some sort of fake paneer that is terrible! Yay!\n\nThey also have a rotating menu so not every day has the same curries out. Neat! Check their website before. Also they have brief, but helpful descriptions of the food and also tons of gluten free and vegan options which they have indicated. \n\nWill be returning, but not ready to give the 5 stars yet."
