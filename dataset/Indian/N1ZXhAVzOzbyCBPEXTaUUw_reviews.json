I tried everything but really didn't like anything and specially I was eager to try the deserts kheer and gulab jamun and they were most terrible. I'm giving three starts because the manager was attentive and was doing his job very nice nicely. The restaurant is under renovation they are making it more appealing but in my opinion food quality and taste must be improved. Sorry for the bitter truth but writing this review in only hope that they improve. Good Luck!"

My friend repeated the order three times.  The repeated her card number 2 times.  Then became tired of repeating my address.  I gave them my address the 4th time.  We were told we'd get our Indian goodness in 30 - 45 minutes.  Not a problem.  We were fine with waiting.  We thought the repeating-ourselves-thing was pretty comical until...\n\nOver an hour later we had no Indian goodness.  We called the restaurant.  We let them know the time frame they gave us and that it was well past that time frame.  The person on the phone didn't seem to understand \"we've been waiting over an hour.  Can you tell us if the driver is near?\"  Several times.  This time the repetition wasn't comical.  Then came Irate Guy On Phone.  \"DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!? WHY DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THE DRIVER IS!? WHY!?\"  My friend and I looked at each other as if to ask what just happened while Irate Guy On Phone kept screaming \"DO YOU WANT YOUR FOOD!?,\" Etc.  \n\nDriver finally showed up while this phone call was taking place.  My friend collected the food and paid the tab.  \n\nThe food, mediocre.  Before to night I was fine with waiting to get it on the latter end of the stated time.  Tonight, a little late because of a lovely nor'easter but the person who answered the phone left such a rotten taste in my mouth that next time I will get into my wheels and haul my butt to pick up from a much better restaurant with less abusive service.\n\nBad service made the mediocre food... meh.\nPortions or naan and poori: fail.  Yeeeeeaaahhh. No.\nWill I order take out or delivery again from this establishment? Nope.\n\nIn short, Tandoor India, you bite and not the way I like."

When he arrived, I asked where he wanted to go, and he pointed to the doorway right behind me.  Auspicious beginnings...\nFirst impression was of an old establishment somewhat in need of refurbishment, but with inviting scents of curry and coriander drawing us in.  I checked the buffet as we walked past to our table and saw an extensive collection of yellow, red, brown and rusty sauces, all looking fresh and inviting on a cold Sunday night.  The place was not crowded.  Settling in, I decided to take a look at the menu because I was not in the mood for a cascade of flavors and tastes, but wanted to relax with only a few.  We were given copies of the take out menu, which somewhat surprised me.  On the cover it said: \"We believe that the joy of eating lies in the art of fine cooking.\"\nI'll drink to that.\nWe ordered Tikka Masala (with Chicken), which came out in a fine pink sauce of tomato and ginger, and was quite good. The Baigan Bharta was tasty, but was chopped fine rather than with the chunky eggplant I expected.  They cheated a bit on the Garlic Naan by bringing us regular Naan painted with garlic butter.  It didn't work, as it was not integrated into the bread, but sat on the surface, and lacked the baked garlic pieces I love in true Garlic Naan.  A disappointing way to pay an extra buck. The Mango Lassi was pretty good,  but a little thin from using milk rather than yogurt.  A nice plate of rice came with the meal.  \nThis was a meal in which we were more engrossed in the conversation than attentive to our food.  The strong brotherhood carried the day, and the meal became background.  For the overall experience, I was quite satisfied.\nWe didn't solve any world problems, but agreed we would get together soon, and try again."

It is reasonably priced and the portions are very filling with lots of protein in the meat dishes (we almost never finish both our curries).  Their naan is good but not the best that I've had.  I like their eggplant vegetarian curry although some people may not like that there is no texture to it becuase the eggplant is mushed up.  The chicken tikka masala and biryani are good but we prefer the lamb korma and the house special Makhani chicken.  The saag is also very delicious and the chili chicken is very good but it tastes more like a Chinese dish because the chicken is fried and there isnt really a curry sauce.\n\nTheir buffet is reliable, cheap and good as well but the atmosphere is a bit dingy so I prefer delivery.  They usually take about 30-40 minutes to the Domus on 34th and Chestnut."

I've eaten at several different places since so I feel I can give this place an accurate review. \n\nAs far as overall value goes, this is extremely affordable for the buffet and the options provided to you. The buffet can vary in options but generally has popular dishes most expect at an Indian place along with several vegetable and dessert options. \n\nThe customer service is very attentive and friendly and I often see that they have regulars that they are casual with and I think that's nice. \n\nI found out through a friend that they do serve lassi's (just ok tasting) and gulab jamun (included with buffet) but you have to request these which is a bit strange as they do not even offer a regular menu when ordering buffet. It kind of makes me wonder what else they offer via special request. \n\nRealistically I give this place 3.5 stars only because the food has been hit or miss when I come. Sometimes it's flavorful and excellent while other times there are several dishes lacking substance and flavor. I will continue to come here because the location is convenient and I like to have various options when eating ethnic food so I'm not restricted to a single dish I may not like. For the price, it's definitely worth mentioning or recommending to someone who's checking out places in University City."

My order arrived not even 15 minutes later, (I work about a 15 min walk away). This really worried me because they have a menu where you can order your food and they have a lunch buffet. As soon as the driver called and said he has arrived I was not too happy because I was worried and assumed that my food was just scooped from the buffet. Well, I opened my food, COLD. COLD chicken, COLD naans. PISSED. being preggo and hungry and wanting a specific craving only to have it arrive cold and totally tasteless is such a let down.

They kept the buffet open for a few minutes after closing time, allowing us to refill our plates. And once they closed the buffet, they brought dessert out specially for us right at our table. And throughout all of this, they were very friendly, courteous, and didn't make us feel hurried in the least. I've rarely experienced such a complete turnaround in customer service!\n\nThe food was also excellent: I've always liked their buffet's panner/chicken masalas and the palak paneer, but this time they also had a very delicious navratan korma (which thankfully wasn't sweet!).

Summary: It has slightly above average food, decent ambience, but below average staff.\n\nLonger version: Tandoor is one of the few Indian restaurants close to where I live and I've gone there many times. My principal reason for going to Tandoor is that it offers a reasonably priced dinner buffet and definitely has better food than the New Delhi restaurant next door: for about $10 it's all you can eat, which I think is a pretty good deal. They have a wide variety of foods to choose from, and most of them taste about adequate, but their gulab jamuns in particular are delectable. It's also usually clean, and not noisy, so it's a decent option if you just want to spend an evening conversing with friends.\n\nHowever, set against their above-average food and ambience is their dour, almost-hostile staff. They were never particularly welcoming or courteous, but on my last visit, they were actually rude. Besides, they don't bring out food on time either. Now, I expect this behavior from an inexpensive place like the nearby Dana Mandi (which by the way has the best Indian food in this area), but not from Tandoor. \n\nI see from other reviews that take-out is perhaps a better option; maybe the food tastes better and you won't have to deal with the staff. But for dining in, I wouldn't really recommend the place. And the sad part is that Tandoor can so easily fix their problem: all they need to do is to give their waiters some basic lessons in courtesy."

They're constantly bringing out fresh trays -- granted, they sort of have to, with the popularity of the buffet -- so you never have to worry about getting old, cold, or dried out dishes.  \n\nMy favorite dish is the saag paneer. I could just keep loading my plate up with the stuff for hours, honestly. But the naan -- I love exploring the great breads of the world -- the naan is deliciously oily, and it you can pile whatever you want on top; it won't get too soggy. \n\nAt dinner, I believe the buffet is $9.95, and it includes a choice of desserts and coffee."

New Delhi (4004 Chestnut Street, Philadelphia), in fact, was particularly difficult to deal with. They were absolutely unwilling to help me get the food even while I tried to be flexible. Tandoor India came to save the day! PICK TANDOOR INDIA OVER NEW DELHI! They were helpful, courteous, nice, eager to help, quick, friendly, all around a life-saver. I said, \"can you do this for me within 30 minutes?\" and they said \"absolutely\" and it happened! And the food was great also. I'm not a great judge of Indian food because I haven't had a lot of Indian food, but I really enjoyed it."

Walking in, there were only 2 other occupied tables who were just about to be done (although to be fare, it might've been empty due to it being summer and their huge customer base left campus). The style of the resturant is nothing to rave about. The lighting was dimmed significantly. The buffet was in the middle of the restaurant, which felt kind of like a long hallway. \n\nMeat options are pretty standard for an Indian buffet, with choices of goat curry, chicken misala, chicken curry, and tandoori chicken. None of those left me with an impression that I had to get more. On top of that, the rice was a bit hard (either they undercooked their rice or used old rice cuz they didn't have a lot of customers recently).  The only side I went up to get again was the naan. Lastly, the chai tea tastes really watered down. If you want a better Indian buffet experience and a good chai tea at it, then I would recommend heading to Sitar which is just a few streets down from Tandoor."

The new owners are extremely friendly and shared that they have been retooling the Tandoor India brand.  Apparently, Tandoor has been there for more than 25 years, so it was in need of updating, which they are doing.  So far, the bathrooms are done and if they are any indication of what is to come in the dining room, it will be a beautiful restaurant when they are done.    \n\nMore importantly, about the food.  I usually order chicken korma at Indian, but they suggested lamb korma, it was fantastic.  They assured me that all of their meat is Halal and fresh.  After eating the lamb I'm certain it was fresh.  I've never had anything like this dish, the lamb was tender in a rich cashew based sauce, but it didn't taste like it was full of heavy cream, it was rich with spices, not cream.  Truly a wonderful indulgence.  The owner also recommended a pumpkin masala dish.  I had read great reviews about it before going, so we quickly agreed, glad we did. The dish healthy (by Indian restaurant standards) since there is no cream and minimal oil, but it has wonderful spices.  I highly recommend it!  \n\nThe owner said they brought on a new chef who is highly trained in both North Indian and South Indian dishes.  The chef will be putting one South Indian dish on their buffet every day (we didn't have the buffet, but next time we will).  I'm looking forward to trying South Indian flavors since all the other restaurants I know of cook Northern Indian.\n\nGood luck to the new owners, they are doing great things."

We always get the buffet so we have a little of all the flavors.  I have always found the foods to taste fresh and homecooked (although I did not grow up on Indian food, so it may differ from your grandmother's recipe).\n\nThe decor has been the same for at least the decade that I have been going there.  It looks like a hole-in-the-wall type place, but the owners are present and very friendly.\n\nTo be fair, I have been to better, fancier Indian restaurants, so if you are looking for the high class, gourmet, impress-your-date experience, this may not be it.

The raita sauce cools down the heat and balances the flavors. The take-out portion makes two good meals for me.\n\nThe buffet is good too when I'm in the mood for something quick, although I usually prefer to have leftovers. Although I found I prefer the chicken dishes on the buffet at Sitar, Tandoor's samosas and desserts are much better. I would say for the buffet I would switch between Sitar and Tandoor.

Now we did leave after lunch hour was over and was charged the dinner hour's price. I don't know if there was some discrepancy since you'd think my friend and I should've paid the lunch hour's price. We should've paid first. They need to have the hours of lunch and dinner printed to see so there isn't a feeling of perceived unfairness.

One day, the owner decides to upgrade his interior to something with blue and white light. These colors probably work well in India, but in the West these are considered cold colors.

Both were amazingly spiced and fresh stews, served with a generous side of white rice. \n\nTikka Masala was zesty with a great underlying buttery sweetness. One of the best I've had. Paneer Palek was hearty and chuck full of flavorful spinach.\n\nDefinitely spicier than most Indian places in town, which may not be appealing to some people, but appreciated by true lovers of Indian cuisine. Can't wait to visit the buffet for some more variety of goodies soon!"

There is a buffet for 11.95 which is pretty decent. I wished there were a littl more choice with the dessert and the salad bar. I took some chicken curry and chicken tikka massala. Overall the food tasted good but really didnt think it was the most amazing Indian food I have had. I wish they had some light music for the ambiance as the restaurant sounded very quiet and me and my friends felt like we were too loud in this atmosphere. The service overall was good."

Outstanding Northern India and Moghli influenced specialties the quality and consistency of which hasn't varied an iota in the 20+ years that I have been a fan.  Up and across the street from the McDonald's at 40th & Walnut, whose Big Mac, Coke and fries cost not much less than Tandoor's wonderful and light years more healthy lunch.  Excellent place with each dish unique and given the quality of ingredients and preparation, one of the very best bargains in town.  Vindaloos are authentic, the nan addictive and the chicken issuing from the tandoor outstanding.  Bring beer or wine or drink their mango nectar."

One of my friends who I ate with also said the same thing.\n\nThere really isn't anything specific to comment on-- I'd just say that Sitar and New Delhi are definitely the top two Indian buffets/restaurants in the area, and I'd definitely go to either of those over Tandoor. Pricing is around the same, and the dishes are also around the same in terms of variety. Taste is just better at Sitar and New Delhi.\n\nI will say that I enjoyed the pumpkin curry at Tandoor India, and that's something I haven't really seen at Sitar or New Delhi. \n\nBeware of dining here if your stomach is known to not react positively to Indian food. I'm Indian, and my stomach still reacted. Hm."

A couple of times we asked for black dal on the side because they didn't offer it in the buffet and they gave us the dish for free.  The proprietors and staff are courteous and quick, and the place is comfortable--you can tell it's family-operated.  For these reasons, we came to Tandoor regularly for over a year before switching our allegiance to New Delhi.  While we now prefer the latter, Tandoor is a reasonable neighborhood place run by good people who care about their restaurant and your experience.  One caveat about Tandoor is that we didn't have good luck with delivery--the one time we ordered our food delivered we decided the fare in the restaurant was exponentially better than what they deliver out."

They are like my superhero that saves me from a growling belly and an empty fridge. I have never been to the restaurant but from my experience of the food, the decor or interior of this place would have no effect on the rating- the food is just that good. \n\nI typically order the same dishes but sometimes try to be less predictable.

However, I'm pretty sure that I evaluated the food correctly, as my friend (herself a native of India) told me what to eat, how to eat, and the proper seasonings (including quantities) to apply.\n\nMind you, said friend and I ate at this small spot FOUR years ago (time flies when you're having fun), so take my comments with a grain of salt."

However I'm making the biggest (and delicious) effort I can to become an adventurous eater. Tandoor India has been one of those tasty excursions that truly made me fall in love with flavor and spice. The veggie samosas are delicious, and even though they're an appetizer (and kind of mild/not too spicy) they were part of my meal both occasions I've been there. Make sure to hit up the chick peas doused in a reasonably spicy sauce too.  Noodles fused with spicy veggies and naan bread are tasty as well. My friend got either goat or lamb  meat in a rich sauce and managed to clear her plate in no time. One of my favorite things here that I totally need to balance the meal is their Mango Lassi. Oh, and dessert at this place and world peace are essentially the same thing. The gulab jamun (basically tiny doughnut holes dipped in a warm honey sauce) and rice pudding (made with with cardamom and almonds) are sooooooo good. Make sure to drop in if you're around Upenn."

I walk in, the owner and his wife (i believe) are super friendly always encouraging me to put more food in my container. Also, they always tell the waiters to make me fresh naan at no extra charge! Their food is by far the best indian food in the area. The food tastes much more authentic and there is a wide variety. The chicken masala and all of their vegetarian dishes are to die for. And do not miss out on their sambosa!! The place definitely needs a makeover but the food itself is delicious!"

        "text": "The food at Tandoor was good, not great, but definitely satisfied my craving. For reference, my friend and I chose to do the dinner buffet. For the price, 11.95, it was absolutely worth it. There was a pretty wide variety of options, though I was disappointed that puneer (spelling) was not offered at the buffet. We ended up ordering a plate of it off the menu and it was quite nice. I had never tried goat before, and though it was a little tough, the flavor was really nice and I went back for a little more. \n\nThe atmosphere of tandoor betrays it in my opinion. I think that if it were a little more upscale on the inside, it would improve the experience a lot. When we stepped inside, I initially wondered if we were going to regret our decision to eat there because it seemed almost dingy. Fortunately, the food was good and we were pleased with our decision. We will return."

I've been going to this restaurant for about 10-12 years and as of most recent, I've noticed significant changes in the cosmetic appearance and the preparation of many dishes. I've also noticed an absence of a favorite or two or maybe I'm not there on the days which it is prepared but overall, this restaurant always receives a THUMBS UP!! \nKeep up the good work and I look forward to many more visits to my 40th street favorite. The slight change in the Chicken Tikka Masala is awesome and the fresh Naan right to the table is a great change to live with . Thank you and your server Khaled is always the GREATEST!!!!! Very kind, very attentive- for years."
