Without further adieu...\nGeorge's Chix is good.  I'm always satisfied with the food and value each and every time.  I haven't branched out seeking much more than a good deal each time and trust me I'm not looking to find the healthiest option on the menu (usually I get the nugget/fries/soda deal, the chix fingers/fries/soda deal, or Ceasar wrap/fries/soda deal- $8 or $9 after a nice tip) but the food is alright.\nGive George's a try if you're in town and looking to get down on some fried grub!"

Their cheesesteaks are amazing (chopped steak) and their chicken cheesesteaks are made from the same chicken as their Char platters, which is legit. Their Char platters come with some of the best and juciest grilled chicken I've ever had. They make their own sauce, so just that alone puts their wings above the other restaurants in the neighborhood that just use Franks Red Hot. I have yet to have something on their menu that I didn't like."

It tends to be fairly consistent and tasty."

They are not overly hot and spicy like alot of places - so you can actually enjoy them.  Im really not sure where else in the far northeast/Bensalem area you can get high quality chicken.

They've got really great chicken everything - wings, cheese steaks, fried, you name it.  They've also got other sandwiches, burgers, spare ribs, seafood platters, etc.\n\nWhenever I want to get a big order of wings to take with me to a friend's house to watch football, boxing, or some other sporting event, I always order from Mr. Wings.  Their buffalo wings are superb - crispy, tangy, meaty, and ready in a jiffy.  The staff is also really nice.\n\nIf you are getting wings for the Super Bowl, I suggest calling the night before or early that morning to place your order.  That's what I did, and my wings were ready at the time I said that I needed them.  This place is great."

On our last order we ordered wings, buffalo chicken tenders and mega fries and have decided not to order from here again. The wings were not crispy or cooked well, the buffalo chicken tenders were okay at best and the fries were terrible. The type of fries that they use are not very good, they use fake cheese wiz and bacon bits that seemed to come from a shaker.

We've been going here for a while and always place good sized orders and I always tip a few dollars even on takeout, last few times we ordered platters all the sides were together in same styrofoam carton and the broccoli juice & butter have been drenching the fries and chicken making it mushy and tasting horrible like straight butter....no huge deal so I thought as we'd start asking for the broccoli separately when we order it, the last few times we ordered sides separately it still didn't come separate and today when I placed an order and asked for the broccoli to be separate from the chicken and fries they said they cannot do that, I asked again if they could just not put it in the same container (seems the girl then asked another person nearby) and then said no they can't, so I said I'd have to cancel my order then and they said ok, haha crazy! I thought I was making a very basic request and wasn't asking for much as I just don't like butter getting on my fries and chicken, but for some reason they just wouldn't accommodate that. It's a shame as we liked their chicken and liked to order from here and small businesses in general. What makes it even weirder is that a salad comes with the platter and I tell them I don't want the salad so if it's about them not wanting to give me another container it'd actually even itself out as I don't take the salad.

I have an extensive order history with them and have never had an issue before so now to have one and have it implied that I was wrong, when the 20 wings were laying right in front of me, was a little insulting. As if I would call them to try and get 5 free wings from them. So instead of just sending me my wings I was offered a 5 dollar credit for a future order. I will never order from them again.

I am looking forward to trying the pizza steak lol sounds interesting. They also offer platters (full meal) with mac and cheese and other sides that you could choose from. It is an endless menu of yummy, freshly made finger food. I am glad I found this local gem... Football season is here and we all know how much we love to skip the kitchen and order wings. They charge .35 cents or so for debit card usage on top of your bill, but they tell you before they swipe it. If you want to avoid the charge just carry cash.
