So I got a baconator, 4 pc nuggets, an ice tea and fries. Why did every item I got had no flavor what so ever. My fries didn't have salt. My baconator was cold and tasteless. My nuggets were soggy and my ice tea that was suppose to be a sweet tea wasn't sweet at all. I'm so tired of this place."

Yeah told the person that I ask for cheese fries and she took the salad out of my hand and put cheese on it.  I am so mad right now and hungry.  I cant stand this place but the plaza is good.  The only good stores is Fancy Face.  Honestly who's with me to shut down Wendy's,  Finally their always slow and the lines are short but it always takes long."

Like what's the point of having a drive thru is they keep on doing that. Plus, there are young workers in there that talks too much at times and not taking peoples order. But again, the food is still good, but at times, there are horrible workers."

No matter what, their fries are always soggy so you might as well subsitute for something else like a baked potatoe (with cheese and bacon...mmm) or just ask for cheese fries. \n\nThe salads are pretty fresh. Their good if you'd rather have something healthy."

The exact opposite...no cheese with a tomato...and a charge for adding cheese! Too bad I didn't check my order before I left but maybe that'll be my practice from now on with all drive thru spots."

I even called customer care about this one and I still have not heard from the general manager. But it tells me the moral at this store is from trickle down I don't care management. Welp won't be going back here."

The potato look like it was left inside of the 1900s and teleported to this day. It's dry ,stinky and not servable. If I could rate a 0 I would."
