The menu is small, but packed a punch. We ordered the Duck Fries, which were heaven. Fries smothered in smoked gouda,  shredded duck, and scallions. For 8 bucks came a pretty large bowl that I couldn't stop picking at. I ordered one of the specials, the scallop and foie gras  tacos...wow...so good (then I read the origin of foie gras and hated myself, but aside that...). The person I was with ordered the pork roll burger, which I tried of course. It was incredibly juicy and cooked perfect. I will definitely come back here. Definitely."

They didn't have the right mushrooms & asked if a substitute was ok. I said sure. But I couldn't eat it. I asked for some kind of sauce & instead they let me order something else. That was so nice. I don't usually complain about anything. I felt like they really catered to our whole party. I would definitely love to come back for a date night."

I ordered the general tso chicken tacos not good and the sauce was too sweet. They were using bare hands to prepare the food which was already a turn off. The place is small and tight everything is everywhere. My 3 year old daughter brung me spray bottles I guess they had in her sight. The Mac and cheese were like baby elbow and partially hard . Looks are very deceiving, everything looks good but I wasn't happy.My baby didn't even like her Mac and she love Mac and cheese and my son love General tso chicken but not this one. I will not be returning ever. The prices were very high too.The food was being prepared or put together after food was cooked at least when a pizza goes in the oven  and bake it kills the germs.You'll do everything bare hands before cook and after and I have the pic of that too I can post it. No sarcasm needed. Thank you Nick. No everything wasn't as quack up to be"

The first exposure to the duck I had was at the beer and bacon festival where they had their tomato soup with garlic pulverized bacon. It was so good they ran out about half way through the festival. \nLast night was my first time at the actual restaurant. It was a large group so in total I tried the blue duck fries, general tso's wings, the pork roll burger, house blend burger, quack and cheese and classic Mac. If you have a large group make sure they want to share because you're going to want to try everything. It's all amazing and will make you want to come back the next day. Looking forward to trying the brunch menu.\n\nThe managers also stopped by our table since it was my friends birthday. They made sure everything was perfect and I was really impressed with the staff."

She went over specials of the day and ensured that we had a great meal. We started with the Blue Duck fries. They were PHENOMENAL! Definitely get them on every visit. I had the duck benedict and my friend had the chicken and waffles. Both were good. The chicken was nice and crispy but could have used more seasoning. The waffle was fluffy and delicious. The duck breast was tasty and went well with the cherry siracha sauce but I didn't like how the sauce tasted with the rest of the dish. It was taken off of our bill without me asking although they prepared it properly, it simply wasn't to my taste. Overall we had a great experience here. I def recommend it. \n(Oh and it's BYOB.

The burger here is really big and unique, but I feel that the meat blend can be a bit better as it seems a bit tough.

They were covered in a Gouda sauce (which was very gooda!) and shredded duck meat. For my entree I had the Blue Jawn Burger which was covered in caramelized onion and blue cheese. I thought it was great, but a little overcooked. The onions were cooked perfectly and there was an excellent balance of blue cheese as well! The meat itself was excellent though! My friend had the fried chicken sandwich which she said was very good although it was a little sloppy because the coleslaw kind of got everywhere. I definitely would go back!"

        "text": "I chose this restaurant for brunch with my boyfriend, based on the fact that I wanted eggs benedict. The Yelp reviews were pretty positive, so I figured we'd give it a go. Most of the reviewers are correct. This food is FANTASTIC and made with high quality ingredients.\n\nGiven that we were going the Sunday before Memorial Day, I called ahead to make sure they had some availability. The hostess told me we'd have a table for 1pm, and we arrived a little early. Another couple also had a table for 2 for 1pm, but due to a clerical error, they could only seat one of us. We gave it to the other couple. This ended up being a pattern for their other patrons who presumably arrived on time and had to wait. This is a pretty bad error considering how much it happened, but given the rest of the experience, I can't deduct a star over something like this. Just be aware that it happens. They were very busy that day, so it took a while for us to get served, but again, not enough of an issue to deduct a star.\n\nMy boyfriend and I enjoyed the quaint environment and bright colours of the place. It had the same feel as Pop Shop, a grilled cheese place in Collingswood, NJ. It was very cozy, well lit, and country style, what with the counter you can eat at.\n\nWe split an order of blue duck fries to start, and they came in a mountainous pile in a large white bowl. Gouda was melted over them with a healthy portion of green onions, as well as some juicy pulled duck meat. Honestly, our meal could have ended there. We were so pleased with them and devoured them in silence- a sure sign of amazing food.\n\nSince both of us came in wanting eggs benedict, we ordered it. Duck benedict with a perfectly poached egg, topped with more green onion and a SRIRACHA HOLLANDAISE. Yes, you read that. Expecting the usual overly hyped sriracha dish, we were proven wrong when the perfectly textured sauce had a nice sweet finish to it, as true to hollandaise. The bread the benedict was placed on tasted like nothing less than homemade bread (could be wrong, but it was fresh and fantastic). The duck on these eggs was probably 3/4in thick- it was extremely juicy and was a very generous, flavourful cut. Nothing in the duck benedict overpowered anything else. All fantastic flavours were appreciated and identifiable. \n\nAll in all, service was meh, but the brunch food 100% overshadows any issue we had with the service. A warning, though, the brunch menu is not very extensive. The choices, however, are very diverse in flavour and taste. Do not pass up this gem."

        "text": "For the price, quality of the food, and the great staff and the chef/owner Kris Serviss you will be hard pressed to find another place like this. For those of you that don't know, earlier this year Serviss was named in Zagat's 30 under 30 for Philadelphia which is a really cool honor. He is definitely showcasing his talents at Blue Duck. We went on a Thursday night thinking around 6:30 pm thinking that we would beat the rush, we were wrong. We didn't make a reservation so we ended up waiting for a table for about 15 minutes. The whole time we were there people were waiting so it might be best to make a reservation in the future. After eating here I am can see why it's so busy, the food is outstanding and pretty much everything that can be made in house is from the burgers, the pasta, to the turkey meatballs. We went a little crazy on the food size and took some leftovers home but we started off with the grilled caesar salad which was awesome, especially the cornbread croutons. We also did the General Tso's wings which were huge and a full order is 12 for $11 and it comes with wasabi blue cheese which is awesome. For dinner we did the special pasta of the day which came with turkey meatballs, the pasta was awesome and you can definitely tell it's fresh and housemade and the same with the meatballs, they were crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. We also got the Pork Roll burger which is the one that won Serviss the Philly Burger competition and man it's awesome, some serious pork flavor there and the special sauce is great as well. Also got some Blue Duck Fries which are just gluttonous and amazing, fries tossed in duck fat, topped with confit duck, and then topped again with cheese sauce. We did somehow manage to save enough room for dessert which was cheesecake that came in a little jar. It was awesome as well, not overly heavy and rich, it was the perfect way to end the meal. So I have to say this place is a winner and I wish it was closer and I would recommend to anyone, but in the future we will be making reservations, at the counter, so we can hang with Serviss while he's cooking."

The only negative was the wait time at dinner. I went here for lunch and the food came out in a timely fashion, at lunch they only serve sandwiches and salads, stuff like that.  I also went for dinner, the menu was more diverse around this time but it took kinda long between courses for food to come out. They were so nice and the fried chicken was so good, I didn't care about the wait once it came. The music choice at dinner was surprising, it was candlelit and suburban inside yet they played lots of rap music which is cool if you enjoy rap. I was just surprised because I was hoping for easy listening type music with my dinner. Now at lunch time it's much more casual so the music choice would have made more sense during this service."

Initially we stood at the host/hostess area for a bit without being acknowledged even though the servers and host(s) looked our way a few times. Eventually we took silverware and menus and sat ourselves.  Clearly reservations are necessary because a family of 4 arrived after us who had reservations and were promptly seated and served drinks before anyone even acknowledged our presence. We finally caught the attention of the host and asked for a waitress.  \n\nOnce we engaged with our waitress, who was sweet and attentive, everything was great. Our drinks were served immediately followed by orders and soon after, our meal.  The ducks fries were AMAZING! Perfectly seasoned with tender duck and smooth, creamy cheese sauce. My husband had the pork roll burger. I think you may need to go to confession after eating this- it's so good, you feel like you did something dirty!  I had the fried chicken sandwich. Tender and delicious with perfect purple cabbage cole slaw and yummy pickles. \n\nI'm sure the hosting issue was just a little glitch and not at all reflective of the attitude of this restaurant. All of the workers were friendly and constantly approaching customers to see if everything was ok or if they needed anything. We were thanked twice for coming in.  The prices were incredibly reasonable considering the quality of the food. We'll definitely go back to try the Mac n' cheese ( which looked just as sinful as the pork roll burger) Maybe we'll try Sunday brunch too, if we can get a reservation!"

        "text": "I really wanted to love this place since quite a few of my friends just visited it over the past week, and last night we wanted to see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately we were left underwhelmed. The food was ok/good. We had the general tso's wings which were good, and then the burgers with salt/pepper fries which were just ok. The burger had no flavor except meat (no salt or pepper) and a tiny little piece of tomato which covered a quarter of the burger and still had the green top part visible, and the salt/pepper fries were highly lacking flavor as well as being crisp. The waiter however was very sweet and helpful. \n\nWhat really ruined the whole experience was right in the beginning, before we even tried the food...we were seated at a table for two which was open near the wall (nice and private). There was another 2 seat table that was in a very congested area and right on top of another table and we asked the hostess if we can sit at the more private one, she said no problem. If we couldn't sit there we would have asked to wait until another table opened up, we weren't in a rush.  After we ordered and received drinks, and after we put the food order in, I was finally getting comfortable, since I am pretty pregnant and getting comfortable is a challenge any time we go out (which has been minimal lately) and also we drove 35 mins from Langhorne to get there. All of the sudden a man came over, didn't introduce himself, and very awkwardly asked us if we can move to the other table (the one that was in a congested area and on top of another table). I was completely floored since I have worked many years in the restaurant business and know that once you seat a customer, unless for emergency purposes, you never ask them to move, especially to a shittier table and because you want to seat other people at their table. They wanted to take our current table and combine it with another one once the people next to us left and seat other people that were waiting to get seated. I first expressed how we didn't want to move and definitely didn't want the worse table, however the man (who I believe was Nick the manager according to the website) started making me feel bad about not moving, so I said ok I guess we will move - at that point he said no that's ok you don't have to move, we'll figure something out (this was said in a rather judging and condescending tone). We stayed in our seats, however the mood was fully ruined. I would also like to mention that within 10 minutes there were about 5 empty tables....2 for parties of 4/5 and a bunch of two's. \n\nBesides the food, the way we were made to feel left a much bigger impression on us. Unfortunately we will not be returning for that reasons alone, although I was hoping to try more of their food at a later date since I was supposed to come back this weekend with girl friends for brunch. I really hope that other customers won't get treated like that, especially in front of other customers."

Taking into account the whole experience, there were a few things that made me give it a 4 though.  Let's start with the burger.  I had the basic burger.  It was very good and among the better ones I've had in and around the Philly area.  I was a bit disappointed when I asked what kind of cheese they put on it.  The server responded with American or Cheddar.  Now, to be a top burger, I believe you have to step outside the traditional cheese box and go with something a bit more exotic.  Having the standards is fine with me, but I like to see a gruyere or goat cheese option.  I bit into the burger and it oozed out plenty of juices-this is exactly what you want to see in that first bite as you know it's cooked the way it should be.  Along with my burger, I got an 8 oz. bottle of Coke.  Let me say that again-- for my meal, I had to ration myself with a measly 8 ounces of soda.  Lose the bottles of soda and spring for a fountain drink system.  My last gripe was the price of the meal.  The restaurant has servers so, of course, you have to tip.  I didn't get fries with my burger, but if I did, it would have cost $20 for a burger, fries, and 8 oz. soda.  The eatery is in a strip plaza in northeast Philadelphia.  I expect these prices in Center City or in an upper class suburb."

It is perfectly smooth and melty with just the right amount of salt (from the duck), sweet(from the dried cherries), and earthiness (from the mushrooms).  Just awesome.  The Beast of the Northeast burger is damn near perfect.  It's also BYOB, which considerably keeps the price down.  My only criticism is they can sometimes be a little heavy handed on the salt, particularly with entree specials and the pork roll burger.  Otherwise, this place is a real gem in Northeast Philly."

I also had the blue jawn burger, which is a beef/duck patty with red onion jam, blue cheese, and duck cracklins. It didn't come with a side, but it was a giant patty. Quite good. Ate too much, too fast, which is always a ringing endorsement."

Unfortunately, the reservation was somehow canceled and we had to wait for a table.  I was not happy!   We were told 4 different times it would be 20 more minutes of a wait.  I was not happy with how the host was handling the situation and eventually spoke with the manager.  A hour after our reservation we were seated.  We enjoyed our time but I was still very upset.  However, at the end of the meal Nick came to the table to apologize once again and inform me that he comped the whole meal.  I really appreciated the customer service and his/the restaurants ability to show that we as customers mattered.  Everyone in the group ended up enjoying their food and will come back again.  \n\nMy one tip to the restaurant is to implement a policy for how long a group can stay after they have paid and finished.  We witnessed a table stay for over an hour and a half after they were finished their meal and paid.  This is not only a huge turn off to people waiting, but also unfair to the servers.  Unfortunately some customers aren't considerate and that's why many other restaurants have policies that stop this."

The only reason I give this a 3 instead of a 2 was how great the waitstaff was and the fact that the duck fries were great.\n\nMy wife ordered the quack and cheese...duck and mac-n-cheese. Small portion but over all not bad.  I ordered the fried chicken. I could tell that if it were cooked properly it would have been awesome...simply awesome and I would have given this place 5/5 stars.  \nMy chicken was burnt and dry but I wasn't sure if that's how it was supposed to taste or not. I finally complained when the $8 piece of cake I ordered was just not good. The lemon curd was ok but the cake itself was blah.  The waitress didn't charge me for the cake so that was good. \n\nOver all this place has a lot to offer, cool ambiance and the duck fries are worth the trip out there.  We live about an hour and 20 minutes from the place.\n\nWe will probably go again but this time I'll send the chicken back if it's dry and burnt"

She even brought us go boxes without us needing to ask.  \n\nTwo tips: \nMake reservations, but don't be deterred if you forget. We had a 20 min wait for a late dinner. \n\nBe prepared for a loud restaurant at peak hours. I think they need to do more to absorb noise in the room because this place is kind of small and very noisy when full. Maybe more decor and sound absorbing ceiling tiles?"

        "text": "Tom and I stopped by for dinner around 5:30 this past Friday, there was only 2 other people seated at the time, the hostess asked us if we had a reservation and checked her incoming reservations then politely told us we could sit anywhere. After that it took 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us again despite the place being empty and there being 2 other serving staff but I did notice a couple of people coming in to pick up take out. The decor is quaint put the place is small and tables are close together so as it began to fill up it did get a little loud. When we finally did order we started with the Duck Fries and Mac and Cheese. The Duck Fries were good, the portion is definitely enough for 2-3 people. I was disappointed with the Mac & Cheese it was just ok  it reminded me of Kraft Mac and cheese it had a runny cheesy consistency I was looking forward to a baked Mac & cheese. Tom like the Mac & Cheese so it really is about your personal preference. Our server read off a long list of specials & I was impressed that she remembered them all,me on the other hand I forgot them & ended  having to get her to remind me again because she disappeared for 10 minutes. I ended up ordering the blackened ravioli which I found out when they brought them out had hot peppers on them, they kindly took them back so I ordered the Ribeye which was worth the $40.00 price tag. Not only was it cooked to perfection the seasoning was out of this world. Since the specials are recited to you and not written down I was surprised when I got the check at the $40 price but it was a good cut of meet that was accompanied with some potatoes and mushroom. Tom had the Northeast Burger and said he liked the Burgers at Gallo's Burger Barn better, again it is all about preference. In conclusion I had a good enough experience that I would try the place again Tom said he would pass, he felt like it was too loud, wait staff could have been more attentive and specials should be written down with the prices published. We both mentioned that to a gentleman who may have been the manager and he said we can always go to their Twitter page to look them up. Not the response that I expected but this is the age of Social Media & I don't think the gentleman was trying to be rude. Sorry I forgot to take photos we were starving by the time we got our food."

        "text": "For a little place it was sure busy for a Thursday night. Service was great and we were sat down immediately. I went with a couple of friends and we ordered the General Tso's wings w/ wasabi blue cheese, the Pork Roll burger, Blue Duck Fat Fries and Blue Duck signature sandwich. \n\nHere are my honest opinions on the individual dishes. First the Blue Duck fat fries. So so good, maybe even the best surprise of the night. While realistically they were little more then cheese fries with some added flare, they were quite good. Even without the sauce they were cooked and seasoned perfectly. That being said the portion size could have been a little more generous given the price of this side.\n\nThe General Tso's wings were okay. Pretty much what I expected so I wasn't disappointed with the wings or the sauce them self. However the wasabi blue cheese was lacking the punch and heat I'd expect from that combination of flavors. The taste of wasabi was barely present and completely over shadowed by the wing sauce and the blue cheese.\n\nThe Pork Roll burger was delicious ! The the seasoning of the meat and the Sriracha mayo worked great together. My only true gripe about the burger is the use of the tiny cheap store bought potato rolls that are suppose to contain the massive meat patty. The burger nearly fell completely apart the moment I picked it up off of my plate. \n\nThe burger has an egg and sauce topping which means you already have to apply pressure to hold it together, which also means the bun needs to be strong enough to withstand that pressure without breaking apart during the completion of the meal. There are lots of local bakery's near by and an Acme up the road in which to buy a bags of Amoroso Kaiser rolls so no excuse.\n\nLastly there was the Signature Blue Sandwich. My feelings about this sandwich are mixed because while it wasn't a bad tasting sandwich I wouldn't make it my signature sandwich. The Pork Roll burger was much easier on the palate. A little too sweet for my liking and could've used some complexities in flavor. \n\nAll in all a great little place with a lot of potential. Will definitely be back in the future."

My issue is the portion size for the price point. \n\n1 - My first time I ordered the scallops and for $18 you get 4 scallops and about two or three tablespoons of lentils. Nothing else on the plate. I was definitely still very hungry so I sampled what was leftover from appetizers, my friends general tso wings, which were okay. Tasty, but nothing special. The accompaniments to the wings were just blah. I ended up leaving this night very hungry. \n\n2 - I decided there were enough positives to give it one more try. My second visit I ordered the sweet potato gnocci $16 and my friend ordered the duck sandwich. I wish I would have counted, however there may have been 8-12 gnocci on my plate max. It looked like less of a portion than an appetizer. I'm hard pressed to think of a time that I've ordered gnocci and not needed a to-go box. I knew immediately I was still going to be hungry. The flavor, however, was very good.\n\nMy friend was equally unsatisfied with his duck sandwich. It was about  half a sandwich size and did not come with anything on the side. For dinner you would expect a sandwich to have something, anything on the side. I felt bad for him and offered some of my gnocci, which we joked about. We both left still hungry and after paying we decided that we had to hit another spot on the way home in order to get some satisfying food. I know this sounds silly, but we are fit people used to dining in all types of establishments, most often downtown and due to the portion sizes and price point at the Blue Duck we will not be back for a third time. \n\nIf I hear they've made improvements in those two areas I would consider returning because they are on to something with their flavor pairings."

This place is not family oriented, needs lot of organization, decoration and presentation is a mess. They barely have 10 tables and how they manage their kitchen supply is questionable. \n\nWe live in the northeast and decided to check this place out. So the first time we visited them, the place was packed and we had to go back. The second time I called in for reservation to which they said I do not need one that day. We have heard great reviews about their duck dishes and so we had decided to order Duck fries and Quack and cheese. As soon as we sat down the waitress informed us that they are out of several dishes especially all the ones that contain duck (which is why we came there in the first place). \n\nI have never seen a restaurant with such high rating running out of key supplies (especially their main dish) - Just bad management. They had every opportunity to inform me regarding the mess they were in that day when I called earlier. Both the times I visited them, I was taking my wife out. Both the times I arranged babysitters to make it happen. Really mad that I could not have the time with my wife like I desired to have.\n\nRunning a restaurant is not all about having one great chef; the presentation matters, the surrounding matters, customer service matters.

It was 10 minutes each way so I kind of wish we had seen it before we ordered or someone had mentioned it.\n\nOur food was so good. It was to die for. I ordered the burrata salad With grilled chicken. I had never heard of burrata cheese before this. I am now a convert to the Church of Burrata. Our server told me that it was really good and highly recommended it when I was asking her what it was, so I just took her word on it and it was the greatest leap of faith I've ever made. Usually something like that, something isn't perfect. Either the chicken is gristley or ice cold, or the tomatoes on the salad are mealy, or the lettuce is wilted. None of that applied. Everything was perfect. \n\nThe service was five stars on point. Everyone we spoke to is a really friendly and helpful and nice.\n\n10/10 will go back!"

I was worried that Blue Duck would be another victim to this and be a Northeast Philly underachieving eatery. \nThis simply was not the case. Blue Duck's food exceeded my already loft expectations. Pro tip- make reservations as this place is small. Now onto the food..\nFor starters we ordered the Confit Fries, Cantaloupe Soup, and the Potato Gnocchi. The Fries have been written about many times and yes they are that good. An absolute must to order. The gnocchi were in a red sauce with cubes of fresh mozzarella. They were like little happy puffy light clouds of pasta. Exquisite and refined, albeit a bit of a small portion. The surprise of the day was the Cantaloupe Soup. It included pineapple, mint, and chili oil. I am an adventurous eater, so I gave this a go. Wow! It awakened all of my senses. It was cool, sweet, pungent, spicy. This neat little dish was the winner of the night. If it is again on the menu, I implore you to try it. \nFor the main course we ordered General Tso wings with Wasabi Blue Cheese. This was a solid dish that was heightened by the Wasabi mixture. I look forward to trying this as a dip the next time I have General Tso's. The other dish we ordered was Lobster Tacos. They included: strawberries, watermelon radish, red cabbage, topped with a vanilla vinaigrette. Quite an experimentive conglomeration of fruit and the sea. This dish  was interesting, but lacked the depth of flavor I was hoping for. \nI simply could not pass on the Blood Orange Gelati with fresh whipped creme. This was the neat little bow on what was as close to perfect of an actual meal. The food and pairings are unrivaled in NE Philly and quite honestly, it is ONLY the ambiance that holds this place back from being talked about in the same breath as Vetri, Sbraga, etc. \nThe interior decor is quite frankly a mess of non-symmetric dishes hung on the wall with lightbulbs hanging out the center. That it is in a strip mall is also disappointing. The sound level in the dining room was deafening. There was literally all walks of life as patrons. Punk/emo, first dates, mesh backed trucker hats, 40 somethings that brought Arbor Mist, etc. I don't want a dress code, but I also would prefer not to eat next to Marilyn Manson kids with huge holes in their ears. Crap, I am getting old. I almost wrote \"Get off my lawn\". \nTo wrap things up, Blue Duck only misses 5 stars due to the ambiance. You go here for the food and endure the decor/patrons/sound level. As someone not easily impressed, this little eatery left me wanting another visit."

Absolutely DO NOT DO THIS. In fact, to save yourself time and frustration, just make a reservation whatever day and time you are thinking of going. The place is super small and you're not going to want to wait outside. \n\nThat being said, when you do make a reservation, they are READY FOR YOU. I can't tell you how many times I've made a reservation at other places and was still made to wait.\n\nNow the food. FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC. Whether you are going for brunch or dinner, you are in for a complete awesome and different experience. Normally I have a hard time picking things on a menu because it's so damn boring. I always try to order something new. Here I just have a hard time choosing because the everything on the menu sounds so good, and it's stuff you won't find somewhere else.\n\nBurgers? Amazing. So far we've tried the Pork Roll Burger, which totally lives up to its reputation. My friend also had the Beast of the Northeast, which unfortunately was just a limited time thing, but they really should put it back on the menu because of how much he, and everyone else that has had it had reacted. \n\nWings? Also great.\n\nFries? Holy crap the fries. It may sound silly, but the fries they have here are incredible. All varieties I have tried. If they did takeout, I would be coming at least once a week to pick up just some of those alone. If you ever see they are making bacon, egg, and cheese waffle fries for brunch, GO. \n\nThe staff is so, so nice. The owners and management have everything set up perfectly here.\n\nMy only super tiny complaints are the size of the place, and the noise level. It is REALLY small in there. Probably for the best though. If they served a much larger crowd, I'd worry that the quality would suffer. With it being so small, it is incredibly loud! You won't really be able to hear the people you are there eating with. Doesn't matter too much though. You'll be too busy stuffing your face to really care."

Let me tell you...the pork roll cheeseburger is the best burger I've ever had!!! They are a little on the pricey side. $10 for the burger and it doesn't come with any fries, but still worth it for the quality of the food. The chorizo Mac and Cheese was mouthwatering and had just the right amount of spiciness to it. My next goal is to go there for brunch. The decor makes you feel right at home with the wooden tables and natural lighting. It's a byob which is fine, but I think they should consider having some local beer options on draft."

On the weekends it's so packed, if you know you want to try this during the brunch hours try to make a reservation. My boyfriend and I have been here multiple times. I personally really like eating duck, so my favorite dish from there is the Duck House Salad\u00a0with\u00a0shredded duck. I love it, the salad is always perfectly tossed and coated with the dressing with fresh vegetables. The duck is always soft and perfectly shredded even though it doesn't have a lot of flavor or any sauce on it, but that's what brings out the true flavor of the duck! All their side dishes are great including the Brisket Mac, Quack & Cheese, Blue Duck fries. Both the Brisket Mac and Quack&Cheese are both bowls of cheesy and gooey goodness that isn't too heavy, but it does come in a nice portion for a group of friends to share! The fries are also a one of a kind, I'm not sure what they exactly do to the fries but they have the perfect crunch and also comes in a hefty portion.\n\nOn Sundays they only serve their brunch menu and unfortunately the salad is not on that menu, so I got a Duck Benedict. Oh, it definitely hit the spot! The duck breast is very tender! Awesome dish, I personally will like it will a little less hollandaise sauce, but none the less still really good.\n\nOverall, this is my favorite brunch spot near my house, it can get a little busy so the wait time can be a little long but it's definitely worth the wait!"

Ordered the house grind, medium, with salt and pepper fries and strawberry lemonade.  The food came out promptly and was hot when it hit the table. The mix in the burger was pretty good, but it came out with not much of a sear and somewhat under cooked and under seasoned. Toppings were one small, inadequate piece of cheddar, a leaf of romaine, and a couple of slices of bland, grocery store style tomaroes. The bun was fresh with a nice crust. The salt and pepper fries were very under seasoned, with little or no salt or pepper and served with a bland, mild cheese sauce. The lemonade was quite good. All told, it was enough for me to give them another shot at a later date, but definately not the go-to place I was hoping for."

The fries were seasoned well and we both really enjoyed the cheese (on the side).  I was hopeful that after tasting the cheese for the fries my mac and cheese would be equally tasty.  It was not.  \n\nClassic mac and cheese....it was reminiscent of easy mac from the box they just took some fancy bacon, cut it up and threw it in there.  \n\nThen I had the General Tso's wings, a half order.  1 flat and 5 drums.  No bueno.  Really??  5 drums???  The spice level was lacking, but the sauce was just okay.  \n\nAll in all, I would give this place another chance, but I definitely won't be ordering the same things I tried."

Order the General Tso Chicken, the Remedy (breakfast bagel), Duck Benedict. The wings were really good, especially the wasabi dipping sauce that came with it. I just wished the sauce wasn't so heavy on the chicken. My Benedict was also too saucy, that my meal was kinda soggy.. Don't get me wrong it was delish, but it was kinda a mess. \n\nService was good, it was a bit awkward to have to turn 180 degrees around just to hear what the waiter was saying, but it was manageable. But the waiter was very attentive!\n\nComparable to brunch places like Green Eggs and Cafe La Maude in Philly, this place didn't really give me much for my money.

The last time I went, I ordered the fried chicken and it was burnt to a black crisp. I actually ate a piece or two thinking that was the way it was supposed to be but it was clearly burnt after all.\n\nWhen I approached the manager, I let him know that I was a big fan of the restaurant but my chicken was black, not too get a refund but just to let him know what happened. I was met with a, \"Ok thanks\" and then I left, feeling like an idiot.

We shared our orders cause we wanted to sample as much as we could.  I'm picky about my Buffalo Wings and theirs beyond satisfied my hankering.  General Tso's Wings are so tasty.  Salt & Pepper Fries w/a velvety cheese sauce will leave you wanting more, Quack & Cheese Mac w/just the right amount of duck and portabella mushrooms; move over Lobster Mac!

Being that we both were born & raised in Northeast Philly, still live in the area and go downtown to eat frequently, we were excited there was FINALLY a promising spot in our own neighborhood.  The first thing I noticed about the Blue Duck was the simple & trendy decor, second thing I noticed was the noise level.  It was incredibly loud with chatter bouncing off the walls and the constant sound of metal chairs scraping across the floor as guests sat down or got up.  We could barely hear our waitress and when we left, I actually had a sore throat from having to talk so loudly over the table.  My husband got the award winning pork roll burger & duck fries and enjoyed them both.  I don't know what got into me but I went off course from ordering the same and got the sweet potato gnocchi with brown butter, roasted leeks, sage & jalape\u00f1o.  I was expecting gorgeous orange gnocchi to come out but I got a plate of gray gnocchi with no jalape\u00f1o or leeks to be found, just a greasy sauce with little pieces of charred leek residue and a ton of cracked pepper.  I really couldn't believe the dish was even served to me, it was one of the worse things I ever tasted.  I don't like to complain or make a scene so I just left the dish barely touched and moved on to dessert, which was good but not memorable.

Two large screen TVS dominate the space.  Tables are close.\n\nLook out for the creepy mannequin in the back if you head back to the restroom.   Reservations are advisable.  Not the place to bring grandma.   More the spot for hipsters and empty nesters who still have their hearing"

Didn't know how good. \nIt's byob which I love! \nWe brought a bottle of pinto Grigio and picked the Bruschetta wings for an appetizer. OMG! Delish!\n\nWe contemplated the night before what we were ordering (like we always do). \nHe knew he was getting the Wild Boar Meatloaf which I tasted and was amazing! (He ate it in 30 seconds....)\n\nI got the shrimp and duck tacos with some yummy sauce that was fabulous. I've never eaten anything like it & ate every bite. \n\nReally happy for these guys to have put something like this together in a neighborhood that doesn't have anything like it, or even close to it.

I was immediately impressed with a very friendly staff. I was greeted as I walked in and things got better from there. The restaurant feels like it belongs in the heart of Center City. It has a young, fresh and stylish vibe. \n\nI was there with my wife, so we opted to grab the Duck Fries as an appetizer. This dish was a flavor explosion. It had a nice layered presentation. The fries were cooked perfectly, and the shredded pieces of duck were nice and tender. The crispy bits of bacon, the sauce and the duck fat topped it off. For dinner I went with the fried chicken. the breading had a nice hint of spice. the chicken was still juicy and not overcooked. The included biscuit was a nice dense buttermilk recipe. Great for soaking up leftover sauce from the duck fries. My wife went with the duck mac and cheese. It was a very creamy sauce with some nice extras thrown in. The addition of cranberries was a nice twist. \n\nMaking the experience better was the fact that the manager came around and talked to those who were in the restaurant. He was friendly and was open to talking about the food, some upcoming specials and what we thought overall. I'll be back for sure as it's nice to have something a bit different in the area. I hope they have success and it opens the door to more places to offer non-traditional takes on their menu."

I am praying to be reincarnated as that duck I just ate--because to die for such a noble and delicious cause would truly be an honor. \n\nMy husband and I went to Blue Duck to celebrate our anniversary (which was yesterday, but they're not open on mondays, FYI). He had been there once before for a friends bachelor party and has not stopped talking about how good the food was. I followed them on instagram shortly after his experience and it's been non stop food porn. The beautiful food photography and great branding gave me the impression that this place was detail oriented before I even stepped foot in the door. I checked out the menu beforehand and had my meal all planned out.\n \nWe started the night off with the Duck Fries--fried in duck fat, topped with melted gouda and shredded duck meat. You could have subbed the fries for human fingers and honestly, the toppings were so good that I still would have eaten it. I was going to get a Cesar Salad because I'm boring and there wasn't much in the way of Gluten Free menu options--and then I heard the specials:\n\nOn Tuesday nights they do a Duck Breast special--tonight was a \"Pan-Seared Paprika Spiced Duck Breast with Yellow Rice, Brussels Sprouts, Asparagus and a Curried Tomato Broth. I am at a loss for words. The duck was melt in your mouth amazing--as to be expected, but what caught me off guard was how good the accompanying food was. The rice was creamy, the Brussels and asparagus: cooked to perfection. If it hadn't been my anniversary I probably would have left with the chef. \n\nAs my iPhone would say, and finally be correct: it was duckin' amazing. (Sorry: I had to)."

We had to ask the waitress to repeat herself several times due to the noise level. We got the duck fries as an appetizer and they were tasty. Perfect crispy fries tossed with flavorful shreds of duck and topped with a creamy white cheese.  The entrees were a different story! I got the Veal Milanese for $24. What I got was two seriously overcooked veal cutlets on a bed of spring mix and drizzled with balsamic vinegar. The cutlets were overly breaded and almost burnt. I couldn't even taste the veal. My friend wanted me to send the dish back and called the waitress over. The waitress argued that the veal wasn't burnt, it was just the balsamic vinegar that made the breading so dark. A blatant lie. I don't send food back, so I did finish the dish, but it was a severely overpriced mistake on my part.  My friend got the wild boar meatloaf platter and it was awful  The meatloaf had a strange and tangy flavor,. I am familiar with wild boar, but this was not good.  She wasn't pleased with it. Our other dining partner got the tacos of the day, Mahi-Mahi.  She enjoyed them and said they were fresh and tasty.\nI am a a Northeast girl and like to support local business, but was severely let down by the Blue Duck. It was busy, but the food certainly did not live up to the hype.  Service was inattentive at best.

The strip mall in which the sandwichery is sandwiched includes benign places of commerce that will have no bearing on the implications of humanity except for that they have been built on the sidewalk on which this restaurant stands. Under the mounted plates and dimmed lights there are emptying bowls; all eyes are on the food and there are no frowns.\n\nThe Blue Duck is here.\n\nChapter 2\n\nAt first you think, \"mac and cheese - I can get that anywhere,\" and then you see the cranberries.\n\nAt first you think \"escargot - I don't want snail,\" and then you see the champagne butter.\n\nThe sandwiches - pork rolled, pounded with tastebud dynamite, and vulgarly acronymed - are cheaper than a Coney Island Corona. The Duck Fries are sleeping with melted Gouda. There's orange in the whipped cream.\n\nAfter every bite, ecstasy; after every meal, sweatpants.\n\nChapter 3\n\nWhen I was 12 a family friend took us to a Chinese restaurant in New York City that served such succulent soup dumplings that I vowed to return every time I ever visited Manhattan. The restaurant was my temple and turned their food into my salvation. I told everyone I would never need to eat at another restaurant ever again. Fifteen years later and I've been to 9 Pell Street in Chinatown almost 100 times. I am its pope and its owners and servers greet me with handshakes and desserts.\n\nForgive me Lord for I have sinned and been unfaithful.\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe Blue Duck closes at 10 p.m. but we stayed long after that. The owners, the staff - they didn't mind; in fact they encouraged us. Nine words with Chris or Matt or Nick and you will have a new guest at your Christmas party, and they probably will too.\n\nFriends: our time on this rock is finite. You must enjoy every morsel of life. And the Blue Duck belongs in it.

This can be your next bad experience.\nManagement/Owners Adversarial and Rude, Badgering and condescending at best.  \n\nThis is probably my last visit there.

Well here is my blow by blow accounting of this last experience.\n\nShould have left when we pulled up and we could hear the excessively loud rave night club music was playing. As we entered you could feel the beat pulsing through your body. And the so called chefs are acting like D. J.s at the same club. \n\nBut since we are meeting up with family, and  we had reservations, we decide to endure further. You do this type of thing for so you can spend time with family. So....\n\nTHEY HAVE achieved a level of incompetence when selecting a table for our party of FIVE.  THEY tried to cram us onto a table barely meant for three skinny people. When asked about it , the staff seemed to confused and frozen on what to do. Eventually THEY manage to put us with a table to share with a group of six. So now we have six strangers at the same table with us.  The strangers were cool about it.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes of being ignored.  Finally someone drops off some water, says they are here to serve us.  (Service was so slow and absent, we all felt very ignored.). Asked for coffee and eventually we ended with a half cup that that had that nasty several hours old and oily uncleaned coffee pot taste and film. Not a good start.  It's definitely the first sign of a business lowering the quality of its products.\n\nI think we were all disappointed on one level or another.  It was a pathetic showing by the blue duck. The bug that ran across the table impressed no one. The dick fries were so overcooked the were almost burned.  I ordered something called the remedy,  What was supposed to be a breakfast sandwich, turned out to be something that immediately of a used feminine napkin that was having huge infectious issues.  It was so disgusting, I took most of my will power not to have done the eruptus maximus Technicolor spray.  Seriously it was that gross.  \n\nThe wait staff kept avoiding talking to me as they saw the vile mess in front of me. And they could see I was clearly unimpressed. \n\nSo finally every choked down what they ordered.  Again more amateur grade food given. \n\nWhen it came time to leave and pay the check, suddenly someone became interested in my issue. Only to experience the lack of professionalism and care owners have.  I found myself being treated like I was in a criminal being interrogated.  Demanding answers.  If you serve things that look like SHIT, you can't expect people to try it.  I had no interest in tasting an infection infested anything.\n\nAs an UPDATE,  I ended up with shits, my girl ended chatting with Ralph on the big white porcelain telephone, the other gal got queasy.

In the Northeast this is a wonderful change of pace.  We have gone over 10 times since that visit. Both take out and dining in.  The staff is super friendly and helpful. Duck fries are best to eat while dining in.  The wings are great for taking out or eating in.  Brunch is a must go if you can get a spot to sit.  \nThe remedy and chicken and waffles are my favorite. \n\n\nDon't shy away because of how busy they are. There is a reason they are busy.

($19) It consisted of fried soft shell crab dredged with cornmeal & served on a flour tortilla with red cabbage, pickled asparagus and a touch of chopped tomatoes and onion. Delicious! My boyfriend had the pork roll burger. ($10) The meat blend in the burger was good. It was lean but rather juicy as well. The fried egg made it.

The General Tso sauce tastes amazing, the wings are perfectly cooked and they come with the most amazingly flavorful wasabi bleu cheese. The Blue Duck is a great place to eat in the Northeast!!!"

Having 10 yrs of experience in the industry, I appreciate this level of effort and want to make sure to support the business. \nDuring our recent visit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed to see that the two suggestions I had listed in my prior review had been paid attention to. Also, during both visits we observed proactive positive attitude of employees and well organized division of work. And, cannot of course forget to again mention the delicious food.\nLastly, without details, Chef Serviss knows that small gestures and making things right when needed create loyal customers."

We're not prudes by any means but the hip hop music shouting the N word & P word were embarrassing as I noticed 2 sweet little old ladies glanced over at me to see if I had noticed the cursing music(?) as well. Other nearby diners were also older so this wasn't the type of lunch crowd to enjoy the same music of say the 30 y/o staffers. This alone would keep me from coming back. What a shame to lose customers over loud obnoxious music when it's such an easy fix. Hope BD reads their Yelp reviews because I'm not the only one complaining about loudness."

My youngest got fried chicken  but kids are picky eaters and didn't like it so much but I tried it. It was interesting  had a mild honey taste to it and bit of spice. Oldest daughter tried buffalo wings said they were good but tasted like a pizza shop we go to but 2x the price. Wife had fried cauliflower  which she like but had some long hairs in it. She orderd a 12 oz  ribeye that she liked however since it was on special menu did not know it was 32 dollars. It wasn't that good. I had some potatoes cilantro  taco thing. It was decent I could not tell you everything on it. I didn't think it would be enough so I ordered a hamburger as well, burger was good. We order fries for the table salt and peppers fries that kids loved came with a cheese sauce that kids went crazy over. We also ordered the duck fries with a gouda  cheese and duck on it. I think it's a acquired  taste. A bit  to greasy  for me never having duck before. All in all we liked it charming place, nice music would try again."

        "text": "After reading a fairly mixed review for the Blue Duck in the Philadelphia Inquirer, my husband and I decided that we needed to form our own opinion. \n\nI so wanted it to be truly wonderful. Northeast Philadelphia has always been sorely lacking in anything that even remotely resembles a creative and eclectic menu and in truth, I honestly believe that's what the Blue Duck is or rather could be. \n\nNot wanting to take any chances, I made reservations through Yelp but as it turned out, we really didn't need to since it was pretty early and we were seated right away. Our server was bubbly and personable and immediately brought us a bucket with ice and stemless wine glasses for the wine we brought with us. Problem one, how in the world does one carry glasses to a table that are so spotted they boarder on dirty and not notice? The funny thing is, when I was telling my daughter about the incident, she commented that she had experienced the same issue. A little Jet Dry goes a long way for spotless glasses and silverware.\n\nWe ordered the Blue Duck fries and they truly do live up the reviews. What could be more delicious and decadent than duck fat and melted gouda? Then throw in some shredded duck and bacon. Worth the calories!\n\nI ordered lobster with a gnocchi shaped pasta and a wonderful tarragon cream sauce. Lobster is a funny thing. Cook it 4 seconds too long and you end up with rubber. This chef knows his way around a lobster because it was cooked perfectly sweet and tender. The pasta was another matter however being somewhat gummy. I would have been happier with linguini or angel hair pasta. \n\nMy husband ordered the amberjack with yellow rice and haricot vert. The rice and green beans were actually heavenly. Soft and flavorful with just enough texture for a great mouth feel. The fish, however, was extremely strong tasting and smelling. There were two nice sized portions but I could only take a small taste. My husband, whom I'm never seen refuse any kind of fish, ate about one quarter of one piece. Personal taste preferences I'm sure.\n\nAs we sat talking and drinking our wine, I looked around the room which had suddenly filled up to capacity starting at about 5:30. Some of the other dishes coming out of the kitchen definitely looked worth pursuing. The burgers were huge and looked juicy and the wings look great but my preference will always lean toward the kind of cuisine we haven't been able to get in this part of Philadelphia, a thoughtful and creative eclectic menu."

But that's were the good things ended.\n\nThere were three of us and we ordered two appetizers to share. One came right away, it was a nice soup. The other a mushroom risotto was nowhere to be found. After about twenty minutes the waitress asked about the risotto. When we said it never came she rushed off to the kitchen. It arrived about a minute later ice cold. As we were eating it with our plates in front of us the main courses arrived. the staff clumsily pushed all the risotto out of the way and put down our food.\n\nAll three main courses were pretty bad in their own special ways. The pirogi were supper grease and over salted. The fried chicken was actually a chicken cutlet without a bone, plus the side of mac and cheese was again ice cold and the duck confit was so salty the skin had to be removed just to eat it.\n\nThe desert which was a chocolate cake, turned out to be a single disk of some cake with a bit of cream of some sorts dropped on the side of it. Not what we saw coming out of the kitchen just a few minutes earlier to other tables. Don't even know what to make of that one.\n\nThe place seems very popular and I'm sure our horrible experience and review wont change that.

        "text": "The Blue Duck is a nice place to stop for brunch or lunch if you find yourself in the vicinity.  It has a reputation for offering \"Center City\" atmosphere, with \"Northeast Philly\" earthiness.  I guess that means you don't always have to run downtown to find a cool place to eat, or conversely, that Northeast Philly now has its own duck fat fries outlet.  Can I hear a, \"Hallelujah!\"?\n\nWe stopped in for a late lunch after an appointment with Homeland Security on Drummond Road nearby.  That is never a sparkling experience, and we all wanted something to wash away the bureaucratic dust that comes with dealing with the Feds. We ordered three of their signature burgers, and the Salt & Pepper Fries for the table.  Water all around. We waited about 20 minutes for our meals to arrive, all the while smelling the grilling beef in the open kitchen.  This was a very hot day, and the HVAC was struggling to maintain the right comfort level.  Even with the front door closed, the humidity in the house was noticeable.  \n\nThe House Grind Burger, Pork Roll Burger and Beast of Northeast Burger arrived in the arms of our erstwhile server.  All looked great with Brioche-style rolls, and the individual toppings.  My Beast was a mix of Wild Boar and Beef, Smoked Gouda, Sweet Tomato Jam, Bacon and Crisp Sriracha Shoestring Onions.  Beautiful to behold.  First bite should have been awesome, but aside from the interesting flavor of the fixings, the \"Medium\" finish requested was in fact, \"Well Done.\"  With the juice gone, I could not taste the difference in the meats, and found the burger less than hoped. The same was true for the House Grind, although for some reason the Pork Roll Burger came out \"Medium Rare,\"  and amply juiced.  The S & P Fries were good; hot, but not crisp. \n\nIt is always awkward to low rank a popular restaurant, but it was what it was.  Someone needs to pay more attention at the grill, as it is likely to have happened before.  \n\nGood luck with your new Center City enterprise."

The place was full of customers, noisy, and the kitchen was busy.\n\nThe chef was able to accommodate my son's request for a plain burger with ketchup.  He was charged full-price for their house burger from the regular weekday menu. I had the pork roll burger.  We also ordered the duck fat fries.\n\nAfter what I thought was an unusually long wait, my son's burger came out with the fries.  They are covered in cheese, but not that fake whiz that some places use.  This was very good.  I wish that the cheese came on the side so I can control how much is put on which was too much on this one for me.  Also, there was not enough duck meat in the rather large platter of fries.  After about 4-5 forks of fries with duck, the duck was gone leaving over 3/4 of the dish with no duck left.  My son enjoyed his decent sized plain burger with his ketchup and finished it.  Then another considerably long wait occurred before I ended up getting my pork roll burger.  I had believed that they forgot about my order until the waitress came and said it was coming up.\n\nMy burger also huge was quite tasty and sloppy with the runny egg coming down the sides after I squished it with the potato roll.  I saw other people's orders including the chicken and waffles which looked and smelled really good, and the wings which had much different sauce flavors to try on the menu that you usually don't see.  The table next to us went through those very quickly.  Also saw the egg roll appetizer which looked homemade.\n\nOverall, I have to try Blue Duck again on a weekday or Saturday to get a better feel of what this restaurant is all about.  The menu choices were more interesting.  Nothing super special today but my son and I did like what we had.\n\n$31 not including tax/tip for 2."

I had been there twice before, once for brunch, once for lunch, and this time was for dinner.  We were not greeted when we walked in and we waited a good 5 mins to be acknowledged.  We were then asked if we had a reservation (who knew they even took reservations at a little place like this?).  Since we didn't, we were not offered the two tables that were clearly empty but instead ushered to the very last two seats at the counter.  Our waitress was pleasant and informed us of the specials which both my mother and I chose.  I had the chorizo tacos and she the mahi.  We switched halfway through our meal so that the other could taste.  The tacos were over done and quite frankly just tasted like regular hamburger meat.  There were a few very hard pieces of what might have been mango on top.  The mahi was quite underdone and the rice mess that was so elegantly described as being mango and jalape\u00f1o tasted like something you squeezed out of a bag.  The asparagus was unseasoned and shriveled.  I think they get too much credit for being interesting in the northeast.  Oh and the Mahi was $26. Really? for a sandwich joint and for that horrid dish, it should have been no more than $16.  If you go here, stick to burgers/fries/mac & cheese and brunch.  DO NOT order their entrees."

So blessed to have this gem in the Northeast and it's only a good 15 minute drive from my house. \n\nI have had pretty much a lil of everything on the menu. First meal I have ordered from here is their pork roll burger and blue duck fries. (My friend and I were super lucky because the fries were half off! Of course, we ordered two plates because America.) Where do I even start? The pork roll burger was just everything you wanted and more. The moment you bite into that burger and break the yolk is just glorious. The duck fries were tossed in duck fat and seasoned really well. Fries were topped off with melted Gouda goodness, shredded duck, and chives. I've never had Gouda in my life and I'm glad I got to share this beautiful moment with The Blue Duck. \n\nI've only been to brunch here about two times and both times were amazing. First time I came for brunch I had the chicken and waffles. I read the menu and saw that chicken breast was soaked in buttermilk Sriracha. Basically, that is what sold me and it was a great choice. Second time I came around I ordered a special which was short-rib tater tots. Let me tell you, I am a potato fiend and these were the best damn tots I ever did have. Perfect crisp. Oh, and did I mention these tots were drizzled with Gouda? A+\n\nBest way to know the specials is to follow their Instagram and if you're coming on a weekend definitely make a reservation to be on the safe side. \n\nI could go on and on about more The Blue Duck but it's way better if you experience it yourself.

There's a bench outside and by 6:30pm it's got occupants waiting for a coveted seat so, take heed, and make a reservation.  The popularity of this place is only going to grow as word gets out even further -- this is a long awaited oasis in a culinary wasteland. (Except for a few great, authentic Russian, Portugese and other international cuisines.)  \n\nOnly 8 tables (one long one for larger groups of 10 or as communal table if no group reserves it, and several 4 and 6-seaters), plus maybe 10 or so seats at a counter facing the busy open kitchen. (Tables are well-spaced, but there's enough open space to fit another small table or two without crowding.)  Pleasant servers all around, anyone will help out any request from any guest and the general manager will stop by to see if you are happy.  I suggested they upgrade their soft drink offerings to be as creative as their food; GM agreed. For now, coke and diet coke in cute sized glass bottles. And BYO.  I LOVE the hours -- brunch daily, essentially, serving Tue-Sun 10am-4pm.  Then, without break, (just a menu shift), Dinner begins at 4 'til 10pm T-Sat. (Closed Sun night and all day Monday.)  Perhaps your best spontaneous shot at a table may be to go at an odd meal time like 11am, 2:30p, or 4pm?  We finagled a seat without a reservation from a hesitant hostess, but assured, if the kitchen kept up, we'd be out in an hour and, gee, we'd come so far and there were NO other options for our ruined center-city sensibilities.  (Stopped by after an event at Fox Chase Farm, a few miles west.)\n\nQuiet enough for conversation when we arrived at 5:30pm to a less than half full restaurant, but an hour later we could not hear each other, nor could the waiter hear us, as the full, loud din of the hard surfaces and chatting diners took over.  When the sun went down, the natural dimming was suddenly rendered too dark by an abrupt lowering of the lights, as well.  The giant tv, hung toward the back, behind those dining at the counter, so not sure who is best positioned to see this unnecessary visual clutter.  (But useful if an important game is on and you must watch it while eating something really delicious.)\n\nMenu offers a namesake Duck Sandwich and gourmet burgers, gourmet mac n cheese (with smoked bacon or duck, and panko in large soup-bowl serving; various spicy wings, tacos, fries or croquettes; but also more serious offerings like a changing fish dish, (they were out of fresh pasta bolognese), and there may be a risotto and fiddlehead ferns.  There's a specials menu, and one of my dining companions ordered the filet which came perfectly pink, slathered in a sauce that seemed a little odd to her (and her foodie son, who sampled a bite) but she finished it all, leaving half the hearty grits, and enjoyed her multicolored uncut, stem and all, carrots that added a fun rustic-ness to the plate.  I was intent to try the enticing sounding Quack and Cheese, which came with small macaroni with creamy gouda sauce and crunch duck-fatted panko, with shreds and small chunks of duck and a good handful of dried cherries.  I really liked it, but traded it half way through for a fellow diner's classic mac n cheese with delectable chunks of smoked bacon.  We  couldn't decide which we liked better, both were great.  The servings were large enough to share, esp as appetizer or side, though you may not want to.  For balance I had the tuna tartar appetizer which I loved; subtly spicy and festooned with edible flowers and little stalks of lavender.  (This may change, but it gives an idea of creativity and great execution.)  Our third dining companion had the meatloaf, a thick slab, wrapped in bacon, with accompanying mashed potatoes.\n\nThe three of us shared two desserts -- the classic cheesecake, with a delectably chewy graham crust, which we loved and devoured.  The Guiness chocolate cake was a bit dry (so we paired with bites of the very moist cheesecake).  It would be great if they followed another 21st century dining accommodation and provided more wheat-free options, including a dessert. Drop the Guiness cake and replace with flourless chocolate.\n\nWish they'd update their website menu, daily if needed, so you know the true current menu -- but they say they keep their other social media updated so I'll check twitter and Facebook.\nAbsolutely worth a weekly visit; but, alas, I'm stuck living in center city and it's not practical.  Despite being surrounded by hundreds of great restaurants, Blue Duck beckons for a return."

It was good but lacked seasoning.\nI got the chicken and waffles which the waffle & bourbon syrup were very tasty but the chicken itself was lacking in any seasoning. Not even salt & pepper.\n\nI also tried the chorizo & scrambled egg quesadilla and it had the same issue of being pretty bland. We expected the chorizo to give it some heat but it really didn't which was disappointing. \n\nLike I said maybe my expectations were set to high by all of the praise or maybe it is just that brunch items are not their strong suit. I will probably come back for a dinner to give them another chance because I really want them to be as good as everyone says so I guess I'll update this review at some point in the future."

If I were to go back for any reason, it would be for those fries. The Blue Duck Sandwich was good. I thought the fried chicken sandwich was pretty dry and had a pretty bland batter.

We have visited them twice in their opening week. The first time we went for dinner. We ordered the Award Winning Pork Roll Burger which comes with a fried egg, cooper american cheese, and siracha mayo on a potato roll. Jason took his first bite, and when I asked if I could try it he immediately told me \"No!\" and blocked his plate off. (he did let me get a bite in though) The flavors just explode in your mouth. I ordered the taco special they were having. That came with slow roasted pork tacos with red cabbage, siracha mayo, fresh slices of mango on top and finished with cilantro. They were delicious and the pork was extremely tender. The last thing we ordered was the Blue Duck Fries. If you aren't a duck lover already, these will certainly turn you into one. They start with fresh cut potatoes that they slice in the back. Drop them in the oil and when they are finished and crispy the toss them in duck fat. Cover with Smoked Gouda  Cheese sauce and shredded duck. I also suggest you sitting at the counter to eat. It is like dinner and a show while you sit. The kitchen staff is entertaining and you can tell that they are concerned about your meal as you are eating it. They want to make sure that you are having the time of your life there, and you can tell they are. They invite you to join into their showcase. This place is by far one of the best places to eat in NE Philly. If you weren't there for their opening week, you missed out BIG TIME. \n\nWe went for Brunch on Sunday morning which is from 10-4. We both ordered Chicken and Waffles. The Belgian waffles were fluffy and crispy. The chicken was moist and crispy. The smoked paprika give it such a different flavor that you don't want to stop eating."

So we had a reservation but while we waited for 15 minutes or so, another couple came in and was offered seats at the counter.  Not sure why we weren't?      We were seated shortly thereafter at one of the darkest tables in an already too dark restaurant and for some odd reason our waitress came and took both of our candles away. :( So about her, Kathleen, our waitress...she dropped a portion of our dinner at the table and ran away/disappeared thereafter with no explanation regarding the missing food. A waiter, who must have taken pity on us finally brought over our lukewarm chorizo mac and then eventually our duck fat fries. Kathleen made many subsequent  trips past our table while we ate but never said jacksh#t to us. No hey, how is everything,  can I get you more water, go f*ck yourself, nothing. I wasn't mad though until I heard her offer all of her other tables dessert and/or coffee before then offering the check but then in contrast saying to us \"are we done here?\" when she finally made an appearance to take our plates. I'm not sure I've ever been to a restaurant where that happened in my life. Thanks Kathleen. Anyway the fries were as good as everyone says. The general tso's wings were delicious but soooooo sticky. General's tacos were good as well but a bit overstuffed. The chorizo mac was just ok. I thought it would have been better if it were more like a traditional mac with crispy chorizo and maybe a hint of cumin but the seasoning was way too heavy and it wasn't nearly cheesy enough. Now, the decor and ambience in this place was just downright weird. Aside from being too dark, whoever designed it must have quit halfway through because the country kitchen, semi-industrial look was unappealing to say the least. Concrete floors, modern loft style lighting, and an open kitchen complimented by horrible cottage-esque wainscoting, wooden roosters, farm chairs and grandma plates all over the wall was as weird to me as it sounds.  And the music...oh my god. Hilarious. I heard Ja Rule, Eminem, Ludacris, 50 Cent and Tyrese to name a few. You had to see the crowd to understand the comedy there I suppose but either way as loud as it is in there already they probably could have 86'd it altogether. Otherwise something a little more suited to the crowd and the No Libs-esque menu and I am assuming intended vibe of the place. Definitely won't be going back anytime soon."

The chicken was juicy and flavorful with great crunch, and the smoked paprika powdered sugar was a nice touch. Sweet & savory were balanced really well here. I saw an earlier review that mentioned no seasoning on the fried chicken - not sure if that was a fluke or if they took her advice, but mine was well seasoned with a blend of spices.\n\nMy boyfriend enjoyed his duck benedict as well. The Sriracha hollandaise was perfect to sop up with a side of breakfast potatoes. And everything was served *piping* hot. I know hot food is sort of a bare minimum requirement, but often I feel like I have to rush to eat my meal before it cools off - this was hot enough to enjoy at a leisurely pace. And of course you can't go wrong with a giant mug of Rival Bros coffee.\n\nI'll definitely be back to check out lunch and dinner.

While I've never been a huge fan of fries, their duck fries had me locked. Full of taste with every bite, we didn't leave a single fry behind. The house special duck sandwich was awesome, yet overshadowed by the special venison burger we also split. \n\nWorking in the northeast I never knew this gem existed. It's also s BYO!

I wish this restaurant was closer to me. The service was AMAZING.... at times a little too eager (I kept getting asked how everything was as I was having a conversation with my friend) But I understand that is what happens at a newer restaurant that wants to please their customers. \n\nWe ordered the General Tso wings (DELICIOUS!!!!!) I regretted splitting them with my friend because I wanted all of them. We also split the Duck Fries, which were really good, I loved the way the potatoes were cooked not to mention the shredded duck and cheese. Lacking a bit of salt for my taste but what do I know. My friend ordered the Wild Boar Meatloaf, I tasted it and was extremely jealous that I didn't order that. That is until I tasted my Pork Roll Burger topped with a fried egg. YUM!!! like YUM!!!! I mean seriously YUM!!!! It didnt need anything. It was perfect and I was tempted to save a piece and try to reverse engineer it. Not really... but REALLY. \n\nBlue Duck is a little out of the way, We made a trip specifically to come here, but if you are in the NE and want an amazing Center City experience, I would definitely give it a try. Apparently the owners wanted it in that neighborhood because that is where they grew up, and their childhood school is right across the street from the Restaurant. 10 points for giving back to their neighborhood!"

We've ordered pretty much everything on the menu and have been satisfied every time. I keep going back wanting to get the pork roll burger again and again, but can't pass on the creative specials of the day. The menu has a little something for everyone, from wings and fries to pasta and fish. It's evident that the chefs do their homework, especially when you see the plating and take the first bite. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and I think they do a really great job for being a fairly new restaurant. I would recommend making a reservation most of the time, but sitting at the counter isn't bad either. I have to make it here for brunch! Excellent food, BYO, great price, and relaxed atmosphere.

We arrived at 10:50 and we were told a 40 minute wait. We were told that the farm table was being held for a 12:00 reservation. Didn't make much sense but rather then argue we waited a bit. Now we had a toddler with us and we were sat at the bar. I wanted to walk out then. Sitting on a stool with no back, that's not really safe. But they had to hold the table 1:10 minutes before the party arrived.\n\nThis was our first time here and we've been waiting to try it for some time. The waitress was awesome, very pleasant and great. We went with the porkroll egg rolls, general tso wings and the short rib quesadilla. The egg rolls were good, nothing really special. They were a bit skimpy on the sriracha ketchup. The wings, not good at all. The sauce was good but the wings were small and a bit undercooked. $9.00 for 6 small wings is a ripoff. The quesadilla by far was the best part. It was perfect! I would highly recommend that.\n\nI wouldn't return. The reservation and seating situation is a joke. The food was just okay. 2 stars, one for quesadilla and one for service. People throwing out 5 stars for this place is absurd."

The first visit to the Blue Duck we had a reservation for 6 people and still waited an hour for our table to become available. It was when they first opened so they were still working out the kinks. Everyone thought their food was decent but wasn't anything spectacular. The sweet potato gnocchi was not good at all. \n\nLast week we decided to give them another shot. We made another reservation for 6 and we were seated within 10 minutes. It was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday night. For starters we ordered the quack and cheese which was AMAZING. We also had the general tso wings(they were okay) and the duck fries(pretty good). Their special that night was lobster tacos which sounded amazing. Three of us ordered them but the waiter had to come back and tell us that they were all out which was a bit disappointing. The other three ordered the pork roll burger. It was pretty good, a little over seasoned to me. \n\nThe main reason that I decided on 4 stars is that this place is great FOR THIS AREA. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive. There aren't many good food places in the Northeast so compared to their competition, they are a 4. I will definitely eat here again if I feel like staying local."

Duck mac n cheese: 5 out of 10 (maybe try a more flavorful cheese! not a ton of flavor on this!)\n3. Beast of the east burger: 10 out of 10 (tomato jam is stupid delicious and the combo of boar and beef is just ridiculously good. The brioche bun is great not too greasy. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had)\n4. Fried chicken: 10 out of 10- the cheesy collard greens were amazing! The chicken was crispy without being overly greasy, perfect amount of savory saltiness with a little kick. Best fried chicken \n\nRestaurant is a bit small and very loud- they have music playing somewhat loud- could do without the music since its so small and can get so loud- this is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.A cute vibe, with a great theme- duck in many apps and entrees.

Second visit was for dinner on a Saturday night. Again food was great, spent $75 on apps and dinner for 2... It was so rushed that we were out of there in 20 minutes with an hour to kill before going to our comedy show.

For starters , the host in the plaid shirt attempted to sit me in the rest room , claiming \"tables are being reserved\" . He also continued to push chicken salad on me after 4  pm. Next the gentleman in a fedora hat continued to stare at his phone and posting ridiculous puns to the social media pages , he looks as if he isn't dedicated enough . The gentleman working the expo station had a nice salmon colored shirt on , I feel as if he had the same shirt on my last visit the night before Halloween . The small Hispanic man working the fryer slowly became one with the wall while he was leaning against it , he continuously made parfaits despite no one asking for them . The grill guy was awesome , there is even a bobble head made of him . They kept calling him \"Johnny mods\" due to his close eye to sandwich modifications . The other two white guys were very quiet and the one left early for a party. The younger chef working saute station had hair as perfect as his technique...... Talk about seduction ! Most of the dish crew looked young and frail , very little potential . All and all I love this place , despite the mason jars they serve coffee in . I will be back , thanks blue duck"

        "text": "Been here twice for lunch.  Both times shared the Blue Duck fries, which are very delicious, though the cheese could be more flavorful (maybe a sharp cheese mixed in) and the fries less greasy.  There's a puddle in the bottom of the tray when they're done.  The flavored teas and lemonades are good.  The first sandwich I had was the fried chicken sandwich.  The chicken, while it tasted good, wasn't cooked well.  It was hard on the end that was thin and not cooked the whole way on the thick end, so maybe trimming the pieces to be more uniform would help. The big chunks of hard red cabbage were impossible to eat. A pickled cabbage slaw that has finer pieces would be a lot better.  The second sandwich I had was the portobella sandwich.  Again, it tasted really good but the execution was not so good.  It was difficult to eat and just made a mess.  Sprinkling corn and black beans all over a sandwich just leads to them all falling out.  There's no friction on the smooth mushroom, so everything basically just squeezes out when you try to bite in to it.  The greens, which were listed on the menu as kale but seemed to be broccoli rabe, were burned and had stalk material which was sort of tough.  I assume they were sauteed rather than braised as the menu stated, because they were blackened and crispy in parts.\n\nThe place has a nice, clean, country decor.  But, it's crazy loud in there.  The (I presume) manager that stopped by said after we mentioned that that they're adding carpet to the underside of the tables and counters so hopefully that will help.  It wasn't even full and was too loud...I can't imagine a full, BYO dinner night.\n\nOverall, pretty good and definitely a good addition to an area that has next to nothing for decent food options that aren't chains or bar food.  I'll definitely go back and hopefully get there for dinner some time."

The restaurant isn't big and we were seated kind of right the middle, wasn't my preference as I felt we were in the open and wanted a more private and intimate feel but food was worth it. \n\nThe restaurant is BYOB and we brought a bottle of wine they put it right on ice and accommodated us. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the General tso buffalo wings and duck fries as we have heard nothing but greatness. These dishes were both really good. General tso wings tasted great not exactly how I imagined but no disappointment. Wasabi blue cheese was mild and yummy too. Then the duck fries were simply divine. \n\nEntrees we ordered meatloaf, pork roll burger and fried chicken. The meatloaf was wrapped in bacon and the bacon didn't seem to provide much as the texture of the bacon was extremely soft (I like a lil more crisp) and I wind up taking it off as I felt it didn't add much to the flavor profile. The meatloaf was good but I don't think I'd order it again. Mashed potatoes were on point. My daughter got the fried chicken and it was amazing. Perfect crisp the honey like sriracha taste was good and the Swiss chard with it was so creamy and yummy I am copying this recipe to make at home. Mac n cheese that accompanied it was also good. The pork roll burger was good too. I would get that or try a different one again!  We all then split chocolate cake and that was good too. Another cool thing is they serve glass bottle soda. If you are going to order a soda it always tastes better in glass bottles. \n\nStaff are excellent. I love they serve high quality food but aren't pretentious like some nicer restaurants. You can see they work as a team and have fun doing it. This makes me want to patron them more. They are northeast Philly's diamond in the rough as you don't expect this quality of food in a strip mall around Holme circle!

We know this is a popular restaurant in the NEAST (to where we grew up) we are currently in the Port Richmond area and my best friend and I gave them a call due to her having to work at 3pm. We called and asked how long the wait would be, the host said 10 minutes and then she can seat us. So we decided to give it a go being that it was 12, we drove up. Assuming they were saving us a seat being that she told us to come in. We get there and then they said they sat a couple at our table. No worries she said it would only be a few minutes, and 40 minutes later we get sat at the breakfast bar. We were greeted by a lovely waitress who took our order right away. My best friend got her meal within 30 minutes, she ordered breakfast corn dogs, bacon and the potatoes . I ordered the chicken and waffles. Her food came out before mine and 30 minutes after she was done her meal, I received mine. Our waitress was so nice and waived it from our bill. I really do enjoy the vibe there, I do understand it was a brunch but the hosts need to be more on top of things. The service was amazing and the food was to die for but the waiting game is what put a funky taste in my mouth. I give blue duck 4 stars! Everything about it is great!"

The only issue that they don't have any competition in area, so the restaurant has not really innovated lately. I enjoy sitting up on the bar so I can watch the boys work. For brunch, definitely get the poundcake french toast."

I also wanted to try it because I much rather support local business than go into the city. \n\nMy biggest complaint wasn't necessary the food, although there were some disappointing aspects. Although we voluntarily opted to sit at the counter, it should be noted that the seats are extremely uncomfortable, and if you are going to have patrons wait relatively long for appetizers and dinner there should be better seating. I only say this because it distracted us from enjoying the atmosphere. \n\nNow on to the food. Obviously the duck fat fries were fantastic! We also got the bruschetta wings which my boyfriend loved. He got the blue duck sandwich and said it was good. I got the turkey burger, which was decent, lacking flavor on burger. The avocado was nice and the bacon crispy. I also got the cheesecake for dessert which was amazing, probably the highlight of the meal. \n\nMy one last comment is that a guy siting next to is sent his food back because part of the dish was cold, although the dish was supposed to be cooked and served that way. However, since the kitchen is open to the table top seating the cook got annoyed and began to make faces and mumble under his breath. You cannot allow criticism, such as that to bother you especially when your patrons are right in front of you. It was a little upsetting to see and made me feel bad for the man sending back his food. The server was great and said she would comp the meal and if he wanted anything else, but the man declined. \n\nOverall, I will most likely be back and try a special, but I think most of these things are growing pains of a new restaurant and will work themselves out in due time."

The place inside had a more modern homie kind of feel. The waiter we had was a guy and it felt like he was new because whenever he came to our table, he made it awkward. He would just stand there and just not say anything for a few seconds to a minute. So we ordered the fries which was pretty good and probably the only thing worth it here. My friend ordered the b.b.b.l.t if I recalled correctly an the way they made it sound, it sounded like there would be plenty of bacon on his roll but it turns out it was only 2 strips of bacon on his roll. The hamburger/ roll was also tiny. Nothing really spectacular about it and for 9 dollars, I feel like it wasn't worth it at all. The next thing we ordered was the the beer battered wings. Those had absolutely no flavor at all. They were extremely dry and not worth it aswell. For my dish, I ordered the pork roll. I expected something spectacular because I kept hearing wonderful things about it. But to my surprise it wasn't anything special about it. I paid 10 dollars for a roll with pork and an egg on it and to my surprise it was even smaller then my friends burger. It was literally like a 4 inch potato roll. Definitely not worth it. All in all I feel like this place was \"hyped\" up. The only thing decent here at the time we went was the duck fries."

Mom, Dad, a toddler and an infant. Their table was against the wall and it was a two top. Kevin wedged the highchair between the two tables. I had to get up to move our table over so the highchair could sit on the floor properly. No Thank You from the host. Thankfully, the waiter told him to move the family to the more comfortable farm table. \n\nWe split the duck fries. Not too greasy. I throughly enjoyed them and will go back to have them again.  \nMy dinner partner got the fish tacos. That was a mistake. They were to be salmon and scallop. There was a pinky nail of salmon on the taco. When I said something, we were brought out a piece of gently warmed salmon. It was cold in the middle. I mean cold. The waiter said that is how he likes it, it is med rare. There was no med about it. The scallop was slightly more done. \nI got the duck ragout, that was some seriously good eats. The only issue I had was the noodles. It claimed parpadelle, but those noodles were no more than 1/8 an inch wide and were al dente. You would expect the noodle to be at the very least an inch wide.\n\nNow to dessert. We got the waffle fritters. They were not to my liking at all. They were a fritter filled with raw waffle dough.  The waiter said that is what the concept was. The outside of the fritter was really good. I couldn't wrap my head around the raw dough. I did send them a PM on facebook, he said he was sorry I didn't like them.  \n\nI will go back to try the pork roll burger. I would love to see that ragout over fries or wide soft noodles. I don't think I would ever trust the chef with my dessert calories again. \n\nI really want this place to work out, as there is so much potential."

The risotto was rich and had a lot of different flavors for an all-around great taste. It worked as an appetizer because there was still room to eat something more. For my entree, they were all out of the side that came with it so I opted to take more risotto (no complaints here). The scallops were seared nicely and had a cream sauce to dip in for some extra flavor.\n\nWhen I was here before, I had the Quack and Cheese which is a nice mix of pasta shells, craisins, duck meat, and some other stuff. I thought it was more of an appetizer, but it's definitely a meal in itself and a damn good one at that. I've also had the Pork Roll burger in which the pork roll is infused in the burger meat. It came with egg on it and this too was very good.\n\nAll in all, this place is great. The service is good and they are friendly.

The blue ruck burger is very flavorful as well. We also ordered several things from the daily special menu...since it was taco Tuesday :) The shredded lamb tacos are on point!

First of all the atmosphere is bright and cheerful with varied seating that ranges from a counter by the open kitchen to a large communal table near the entrance.  For my first visit I went with the blue duck sandwich.  (Who makes duck sandwiches besides this restaurant?)  It was great.  The shredded duck provides both a sweet and savory taste sensation. I could have used a bit more Swiss chard and a little extra of the blueberry bbq sauce but it was still totally tasty.

The wooden picnic-like tables, rustic silverware, and old school, hipster 1950's  soda cream shop vibe, really sets high expectations of a great meal. That, and the fact that this restaurant was completely packed on a Saturday night. While the ambiance definitely does not disappoint, the food is really a hit or miss. I thought the duck fries and my bf's blue duck sandwich were great. At the same time, how can you go wrong with the combination of cheese and fries? The blue duck sandwich, with shredded duck meet and roasted mushrooms was delicious -- savory with a hint of sweetness. For my own entree, however, I was not a fan of the Pappardelle (pasta with duck ragout, roasted portabella, dried cherries, shaved Pecorino). The actual taste of duck was lacking and my meal in general seemed to be lacking in flavor. I also sampled my friend's Wild Boar Meatloaf, and while the entree sounds rather  adventurous and enticing, it was more \"meh\" than \"whoa.\" I would probably go here again but just go with the sandwich. I also hear their brunch is worth the trip. In the end, I give say this restaurant is \"A-OK.\""

We took my friend from out of town for brunch. It was ok. The food was mostly good. My friend's roll was cold, like came out of the fridge cold, and it was an awkward sensation when biting into a hot burger and she was not a fan. My food was standard, nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either. Husband liked the pancakes.  My complaint is the lack of veg friendly foods. The staff was friendly, and pretty quick. Our waitress was very nice when we questioned some of the things on our bill (2 extra entrees that we didn't order) and quickly fixed the check for us. Love the idea of the cute mason jars for coffee, but they were a little hot to the touch. We observed that there were a lot of little things that needed to be improved in the food and the service but we attributed this to being a new place and made allowances for growing pains.  Overall, it was a good enough experience to want to come back.   \nFast forward a month- we decided to give dinner a try in the middle of the week, at about 8 PM. Mistake One- no reservation. We show up and the place is full (and so so loud) and are told that it would be about 10 minutes, so we decided to wait.  We waited, and waited, and waited as many more couples came in, without reservations, and were seated. The way the hostess greeted these people made it appear as though they were friends, so maybe they got preferential treatment but still, after hearing the hostess ask if they had a reservation and finding out that they did not, they ended up seated. After 20 minutes, we decided to go. I told the hostess that we changed our minds and would be leaving and she responded with a sarcastic \"Oh that's too bad.\" \n\nReally wanted to love this place, but the bad second date determined that this was not a match made in heaven for me."

We went during the week at noon and there were only 3 other tables.  The waitress was amazing but the food mediocre at best.  The wings were not cooked quite enough but the sauce was still great. I got a brisket Mac and cheese which sounded like heaven. But not so much.  Very bland, no flavor at all, I had to ask for salt and pepper.  The kid didn't even like it.  Then my burger came.  I like it medium. I even like medium rare. It was raw and moldable the waitress took it off the bill it was so gross. The only thing that was good was the fries. Do disappointed. \n\n10/2/2015 So this place was up to all the hype. I'm just sorry I didn't try it sooner \n  First I suggest reservations and it is a BYOB. We actually got seated at the counter which I wasn't happy about but then I was super happy about it. It was awesome to see these guys in actions and get a look at all the amazing food that was being put out. We had the Mac and cheese with bacon. It was pretty good but not amazing. The buffalo wings were huge and delicious with a slight tang on the wings that made them awesome and we can't wait to get them again. We also had the fries fries in duck fat with duck crumbles on them. The fries where awesome. I didn't like the actual duck but the man loved it. The fries where somehow crispy and covered in cheese ( Miracle). Now we both had burgers which we had to change to to go because of children that needed picked up and thy wrapped our burgers up and we took them home and ate them. They were delightful he had the porkroll with a egg on top. And I had one with blue cheese. Can't wait to go back and try more things!!!"

The signature duck fries are a delight, but that's where the praise ends... Our waitress did not bother to check whether we needed anything; she did not refill our water, while the men dining next to us had a full carafe. The place was packed, which is a no-brainer for a holiday weekend, but wait staff kept messing up orders all around us! (Hearing the head chef ranting in the back was hilarious.). So, we finished our fries and see that our food ended up at someone else's table. Before long, the waitress who served it (not ours) is throwing the dish away. Wow... Just wow. I had no choice but to inform the boss, who didn't even flinch, much less apologize. At least he had the decency to comp our meal. The duck fries are normally $14; while they are delicious, today's portion was overly salty and dry, hence not worth $14. Sorry, guys, no tip for you! Anyone looking for a great duck-centered meal in Philly, Sang Kee is the place to check out."

We ordered an order of the duck fries for the table, my sons both ordered the chicken and waffles, my wife ordered a prime rib special breakfast sandwich on a bagel and I got the duck eggs benedict. They were pretty busy.  We waited for a while to finally get the duck fries.  They tasted good but they were cold.  The gouda cheese sauce was hardened.  Disappointing.  When we finally got the rest of the order, I was disappointed to see that the eggs benedict was actually egg benedict. There was a small piece of bread, covered with a small overcooked, chewy piece of duck breast, with a single poached egg covered with sauce.   I will say that the cherry sriracha hollandaise sauce was terrific.  It really complemented  the dish well.  I just wished there was more food especially being the most expensive thing on the brunch menu. I thought this was a big ripoff for the price.  Luckily for me, my wife only ate half of her sandwich so I managed to stop my stomach from grumbling by scarfing the other half. The sandwich was not anything special.  I will not come back for the brunch, ever. I don't recommend it for others. However, the lunch menu does look pretty good.  I will not go out of my way to make a return trip but I would give this place a second chance if I'm ever in the area for lunch or dinner.  The BYOB is good to take advantage of."

Open kitchen counter seating, which would be perfect for a date night.\nTons of staff, and very attentive.\nHighlights of the meal were the quack and cheese and the duck fries. We all agreed we could have eaten the fries all day. In my opinion, a ketchup would take them over the top. Something sweet tart to cut the cheese and duck and fries, maybe cherry siracha?\nDinner highlights were the salmon special, boar meatloaf, and the fried chicken. Fried chicken and creamed swiss chard were fantastic.\nReason for 3 stars: worst part of the meal was the burger. Yep. The reason we came here. It was dry and bland and came with no sides. My son was really disappointed.\nDessert. Two options. Two. Chocolate mousse pie was just eh. Such a homey place should have a homemade cake, maybe pudding, and a fruit crisp on the menu. Lastly, super cute, SUPER FILTHY restroom. This is a bad sign for a restaurant. As Anthony Bourdain says in is best seller kitchen Confidential, any good restaurant will have a clean bathroom. If they don't keep what people see clean, what does the back look like??? Scary.\nWith the over abundance of staff running around for for about 13 tables, no one can wipe down the bathroom once an hour? Ive run 2 businesses, and I always cleaned the bathrooms.

But since this was a mistake on our part we decided we'd enjoy our meal anyway! \nWe had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated, which was actually a good thing considering it was a holiday weekend.\nThe food is aesthetically pleasing but once I put it in my mouth I nearly gagged. We had ordered 3 items, the duck fries, a breakfast tostada, and some omelette thing.... \n\nWe started with the duck fries and were NOT bemused. I was actively taking photos of everything that day... I realized after eating almost ALL the fries I hadn't taken a picture yet! It was just THAT delicious. The aroma was delightful... Duck fries have a million stars in my book...\n\nAfter devouring that, we were anticipating what the next dish had to offer. Our omelette arrived... First impression was that something smelled entirely rotten.  I shrugged and tried to convince myself it was nothing.... As I cut it open the smell became more potent.... I pit it in my mouth... Didn't pass my tongue. \nThis dish that looked beyond professional and beautiful didn't make the cut.\n\nWhen the tostada were in view, my fiancee and I were praying that it would cleanse our pallets from the 'egg dish that shan't be spoken of'\nThough it may have been delicious to most, brisket was the main ingredient used in this dish. I have very distinct standards concerning brisket.... In this dish the brisket was very fatty and slimy, not to mention it tasted undercooked. I couldn't eat much.... But my fiancee could tolerate it for a little longer. Over all the brisket tostada was a let down.\n\nReading this, you probably wonder why I gave this 3 stars. Well as we were preparing to pay the owner stopped us to ask how we enjoyed our meal. I said it was okay, trying not to be rude, but my fiancee (whom has no filter) expressed our true disgust over the last two dishes. At first I was embarrassed by my fiancee's loud mouthedness, and was starting to apologize when the owner instead apologized and removed the last two dishes from our bill. I've never experienced this before. So 3 stars for them!"

The smoked Gouda on top just sealed the deal. I ordered the Brisket Mac as my entree. I'm a fan of Mac and Cheese in general and it's a hard dish to mess up. The Brisket Mac was good, creamy and tasty. The added Brisket and jalape\u00f1os didn't do much for me, though. The next time I go, the Quack and Mac will be my first choice. \n\nThe open kitchen was a nice touch and I found the layout and decor to be cozy, but not stifling or kitschy. We did go on a week day evening so I can't attest to how crowded it gets on weekends.

We knew to expect this so this was not a problem. \nAs we were eating, a lady who was a regular told us to make sure to try the specials and to get the fries with extra sauce.  Thank goodness we took her advise... All were fabulous.   I wish they had a sampler platter of everything on the menu because all sounded scrumptious.  The service was excellent.  The waitress was great.  As busy as this place was, we never felt rushed.  Thank you for a great time!!"

Got there a few minutes before 1:30, and the line was out the door. Checked in with one of the girls.waited 45 minutes, and never got seated. Kept waiting for a table to open up before we decided to go elsewhere. What's the point of making a reservation if it's not reserving anything? Saw that something similar happened to someone about a month ago. They wrote their party was comped with a $100 gift card. We got nothing. My advice, if you have more than 4 people in your party, go at your own risk, and have a backup plan."

Everything is spot on, the duck fries are a MUST. The burgers are all delicious, the quack and cheese is out of this world. \nHowever it is really unfortunate that the service just plain sucks. From the first moment you enter through the door, no one welcomes you, not even a smile. I honestly believe that they are told not to smile. They all look miserable!  At our latest dine in, we made reservations and when we got there, we were being sat at the long farm house table in the front. Which for 4 people, is a bit awkward when there's a separate party sitting at the other end. We asked to move and thankful there was another 4 person table open that we grabbed. We were then given waters by another girl and guess what not only did she not say hello, or smile, she barely opened her mouth to say you're welcome after we thanked her for the waters she gave us. It looked painful for her to speak. Then our waitress came over, I was really hoping for more but unfortunately got more of the same. I guess they all just drink from the same kool-aide!  There was no \"hi welcome to blue duck my name is ...\" NOTHING! If it weren't for her name plate necklace we would had no clue who this girl was. She was decent, but still not very attentive. We brought beers and wine and often times didn't clean the empty bottles on the table, we literally had to ask her to take them.. Take any of our dirty plates. \nApps were all delicious, we had the cauliflower, the duck fries, and two different wings. All apps came out about the same time and we're all steaming hot and delicious. \nThen we waited awhile for our entires. We had ordered a burger, fried chicken, scallops, and gnocchi. The burger came out first and then sat there for awhile.. We finally had to tell our friend to eat without us because the rest of our food was taking so long. When we looked back at the cooks, they were all flirting with the girls at the counter. Really?? We could see that even our waitress was annoyed. The rest of the food came out, but again not all at the same time. Other than the timing of the food, the food was delicious. \n\nIt's just a shame. The food is slamming. All around, never had anything here my friends or myself didn't love. (I think my suggestion is take-out.). HOWEVER!! Everything else is blah! And honestly the servers at chick-fil-a are more polite and friendly. Take a page from their book!  We are total foodies, love great food, and kill for awesome service. If the owner or chef is banging out such great dishes, they need to look at the front of their house and get that up to speed! They are killing their business with mediocre service."

I emailed ahead of time to ask if I could leave flowers at her table and it was of course no problem. I went ahead before she got there and dropped off a card, flowers and a bottle of champagne. They were more than accommodating and made her feel extra special when she got there. Thank you, Blue Duck for treating your customers like friends and not just a paycheck."

Called for reservations early in the day (right after 11am) and there was only a reservation available for 8:30pm for two. We were seated right on time upon arrival. We ordered the duck fries which were good- the fries seemed homemade and very crispy which I liked. The Gouda is a good choice for cheese too but the duck wasn't as flavorful as I would've expected. Next we ordered the tacos- this day was beef brisket. They were absolutely delicious! $23 for three tacos seems excessive but they were good enough that I can overlook the price this time. They were listed as MP which I think is a little silly unless they're serving lobster at some point. My husband got the Philly burger. It had bacon on it and was cooked perfectly but it was just \"good\", not as great as reviews made it out to be. The choklate cake dessert was a waste of calories and money, it was bland without the flavoring (mint and raspberry) but the flavoring was too strong with mint. Service was excellent. I will return just because there was so much I want to try, including mac and cheese and French toast. I will update when I return."

But believe me and whatever they say about the fries. Blue duck fries can be a meal itself if you have a small appetite. There are some fries with more salt than others but its a seasoning no big deal. \nNow if you're like me and need a little more, sure order either the quack n cheese OR burger (I got smoked bbq pork). Ordering both is way too much. I thought I could handle it. \nQuack n cheese (green bowl) has portobello mushroom, scallion, dried cherries. \nSmoke bbq pork is served on potato bread. The salt from the fries goes well with the pickles. \nHappy with my choices. Left bloated."

It's especially nice when the place puts some real effort into decor, staff, and service along with a nice menu and some solid specials.  The Blue Duck is exactly the kind of restaurant we need, and hopefully they will thrive so that other restaurateurs will see that our area of town can be a profit center as well as a destination to dine.\n\nAs always, I over-ordered.  I tend to do this on the first time out, but the bright side is plenty of leftovers and a nice sample of the menu.\n\nStarted with a special, shepherds pie fritters.  Nice bits of lamb, peas, potato and  seasoning rolled in a very large ball, breaded and deep fried.  It was delicious.  I also sampled the grilled romaine salad.  I've had similar salads, and this one was a bit of a mess on the plate, but it tasted fine.  I don't know if I would rush to it again,\n\nDinner was the Blue Ruck Burger and a side of the Blue Duck Fries.  The burger was a bit overdone for my taste, but it had nice flavor and consistency.  It's an odd patty blend of duck and beef, and I don't know that the addition of duck really brought too much to the game.  The crispy bits of duck cracklins that topped the burger was a nice touch.  I've not had that on a burger before and it stood out without detracting from the burger itself.  They would have been nice on the salad as well. Actually, they would be good in a bowl on the table...or at my house in front of the tv.  Good anywhere...really.  Duck cracklins could be the new pork rinds, but better.\n\nI was thrilled with the  Duck Fries, smothered in melted Gouda cheese, scallions, and a healthy dose of Duck confit, which I can never get enough of.  Duck on fries is magic.  I'm pretty sure that regardless of my entree, I will be ordering a bowl of these for the table.  If you get nothing else, order a bowl of these to munch on.  You won't be sorry.\n\nThe service was very good.  We came on a Tuesday evening around 6:30 and had no trouble getting a table, but by 7:30 the restaurant had filled up.  A full house on a Tuesday night is a good sign.  My only fear is that if it's the only game in town, it will quickly become a hassle to try and dine there.\n\nGet the word out!  Come eat here!  Just don't come when I want to eat."

I also had the ice cream dessert, dunkaroonies, which felt like a child-like ice cream with tones of jimmies. I like how hip and lax the restaurant is, it's nice and casual. I do wish it wasn't so loud in there, but I think it's like that because the restaurant itself is small and echos or amplifies the people talking. One thing I felt about the service: I liked that our waiters were very kind and made sure we got what we needed, but I felt like they were also a little less attentive than they should be.

We could have sat for 5 hours and no one would have noticed since our server NEVER interacted with us once she took our order over an hour ago (that she ended up losing anyway) 1 hour 45 minutes later we ate, with no apology or compensation or regard for the fact that we sat there for almost 2 hours like assholes. In the end our bill was delivered and AGAIN absolutely no regard for the fact that some screwed up royally. The menu is unique, the food is good, UNFORTUNATELY as a paying customer, it is up to YOU AND ONLY YOU to harass your server on a constant basis to ensure that you actually get to eat.\n\nAfter posting this review on their Facebook page, the manager Nick lied, saying I paid my check at 12:08, actually that is when we gave our order a second time, he also said he compensated us by not charging us drinks.

It was also, like many Philly restaurants, fairly loud.  \n\nBut on to what was more important - the food !\n\nThe \"Quack & Cheese\" was most likely the best mac & cheese we've ever tasted.  It was made up of delicious shredded duck, roasted portabella mushrooms, smoked Gouda and dried cherries and was way large enough for the 2 of us to share.\n\nThe Fried Chicken with Sriracha buttermilk coating was very good without being spicy-hot from the sauce.  It came with Swiss chard & Pancetta.  The Duck Breast entr\u00e9e with Brussels Sprouts and Boursin cheese was also delicious.\n\nWhat we found somewhat amazing was the care given not only to the main ingredients in the dishes but also how well prepared the various vegetables were cooked and presented.\n\nSo with tax & tip the bill came to around $66.

The idea behind using duck is pretty cool since most of the restaurants around here are chains or typical bar food.

I've had their duck house salad, chorizo mac and cheese, duck fries, wild boar meatloaf, and general tso tacos. Duck fries are on point! I waited till my 4th time going till I got the duck fries and I'm a little bummed I waited that long. The duck house salad is amazzzzzzzing. Meatloaf wrapped in bacon was delicious and their mashed potatoes are yummy. Downsides, they used a little more cheese than I would like in the mac and cheese and too much sauce on my taco.

The seating it limited which is probably the downfall of this restaurant, I hope that it will expand because the employees are great and the food is even better.

There were 3 big slices of meatloaf covered in gravy and my favorite part was the bottom where the mash potato was! I LOVED THE MASH! They should def offer this as a side because I would get loads of this for myself lol  \n\nFried Chicken ($19)- pickled- brined, cream Swiss chard & bacon, mac and cheese with tabasco honey-- my hubby order this and he loved it there was nothing left on his plate which is strange because he usually takes some home.

        "text": "Blue duck is a simple take on BYO's in NYC or downtown Philly. The food is good for the area but it's a one trick pony and the pony isn't quite the stallion it should be. I will say it doesn't change enough and there aren't enough specials to keep the seasoned blue duckers satisfied. It's definitely a pick a menu favorite and come and scratch the itch once a month or less. I was there three times and only for dinner and I was already bored. I am very curious as to what their brunch is like. I have heard good things and it's hard to screwup eggs (although it can be done). Even the brunch menu hasn't gotten any type of makeover since it opened (I think). Anyway, the first time I was there I had the Brussel sprouts with bacon, fried cauliflower, and the duck special. Fried cauliflower was really delicious and cooked perfectly. The Brussel sprouts were very good as well. I just wondered where their veggies are sourced. They were very big Brussel sprouts which makes me think they may have been from a wholesaler and not a local farmer. Either way good. The duck was ordered medium well and it came pretty much raw. The skin was crispy which was nice but I didn't want duck sushi. Sending it back isn't an option since the mental picture is there and the meal is basically over. Food should never have to be sent back to be cooked right. Step your game up chef. Granted they were busy but that is no excuse since top chefs like Mark Vetri consistently churn out perfect dishes one after the other daily. If you wanna be on that level, you gotta cook at that level. Earn your rep boys. The first go round was about a 5. The person I went to dinner with got salmon and it was a  very nice piece of fish and the potatoes were quite delicious. The second time I was there I had a better experience with where we sat but the food was really lackluster. I usually try specials when I am at a byo, but I decided to change it up and try an in-house staple, the fish tacos. Granted I do not like farm raised tilapia and neither should you but I gave it a go anyway. It's pretty gross when you see how they raise those things but nevertheless I went in with an open mind. A lot of times you aren't even getting tilapia, unbeknownst to the chef but that's a different story. Ok, so the fish tacos. The tortillas were kind of cold and really just raw. You can't just lay tortillas down under got food. They get soggy and the texture ends up feeling very mushy and soggy. The toppings weren't amazing and it could have used a little more umph (fresh veggies, cilantro, slaw etc). The mayo was haphazardly squeezed on top in very unappetizing squiggly lines. It made the dish look cheap and like something Denny's would have on their international dinner menu. The fish was deep fried like it should have been, but the taste was just bad. Fresh fish isn't fishy and has a very delicate flavor. Frozen, farmed fish taste like the slimy toilet they are bred along with subtle but familiar freezer after taste. I couldn't eat the fish tacos. I was skunked at the duck again.  I think blue duck should really run in the, locally sourced, FARM TO TABLE FRESH, healthy food\nwith constant new takes on the menu. Otherwise they won't be around long. Although the northeasters really don't expect much in way of cuisine ( that's why so many greasy spoon diners remain open there amongst the fast food and bad pizzas). The northeast is hellosh when it comes to trying to find healthy, delicious, interesting food. The blue duck could save the day if the mama duck can get the bull whip out and get to work kicking those little ducks asses into shape. The owner is a very nice guy and the whole staff is likable and sweet.  Also, the female waitstaff are all very nice to look at... Especially one in particular ;) B \nI like this place but I wanna love it. It's like a coach wanting a player to succeed in the highest level. You wanna see a culinary underdog like the BD make it because they are great for the area and I love that they are expanding people's horizons and opening their minds. The northeast is where I am from and I know how close minded people can be. It's tough to make it in the city but at least there are people who know good food when they see it. They can get good feedback and perfect their menus based on foo foo customer reviews Etc. The only way to get good, is to find out what you are doing bad and change it. I really want this place to make it past those dreaded first years and become a staple. They are the bar setters and I am hoping a total food revolution takes place in that area. I am rooting for the duck and I will continue to eat there."

I stopped in mid-afternoon for a sandwich and fries but they do simple food really well. Love the open kitchen vibe and the quaint decorations. Easily the best spot in the northeast and my new go-to when I'm home from the west coast. Kudos guys."

        "text": "Everything I said to my prior review and more. I've been wanting to try Southern style chicken and waffles for a long time. I searched through and through. All of a sudden, a Yelper points out to me that The Duck offers them on Sundays. Oh, The Duck! I had been here before, and thoroughly enjoyed my food. Why not have at it again?\n\nBrunch is 10-3 on Sundays (it's recently been changed). They offer a different menu with an interesting choice of specials (if I wasn't mistaken, I believe I saw what looked like Fruity Pebbles cooked into French Toast going to someone's table). I skipped the specials because I knew what I was there for. While I was at it, I went for the General Tso Wings for an appetizer, because...why the hell not? Wings sounded great at 10am. A cup of coffee also accompanied my meal. \n\nAs I waited for my food, I did see that the place fills up QUICK. We even got there a few minutes before they opened, and there were people already waiting to get in. It's a small space. It's cozy. You will have a table 2 inches from yours, but it's fine. You'll be so focused on your food that it won't even matter. I suggest you make a reservation, which they gladly take, or just get there early. \n\nThe Rivals Bros coffee was delicious. It's $3.00 a cup, but the cups are pretty big with welcomed refills. My wings had such a beautiful presentation that I didn't even want to touch them. They were FANTASTIC. It was $6.00 for 6 very large wings that were tender and bursting with flavor. I could have eaten that side of wasabi blue cheese with a spoon. It was smashing. I would have been fine with coffee and wings alone. Shortly after came out the chicken and waffles. I actually really loved that it wasn't drowning in syrup (though if you're a syrup lover, you will want more-- they use it sparingly). The waffle was good. The chicken....that chicken was so great. It had been a very long time since I had eaten a piece of fried chicken, and it was worth eating. How you're able to get the outside so deliciously crispy while retaining the moisture within is behind me, but I was certainly pleased. \n\nThe guy that runs the place (I'm only assuming he runs the place) is really friendly. He treats everyone like he knows them, which is super dope. The waitress we had this morning was sweet (something that fell short the last time I had been here...but the food was so good the first time that I didn't give a shit how grumpy my server was). Today though, it was all good. Yes, the hostess isn't the happiest person in the world, but who cares? My bill came out to around $32 (I was with someone else who had also ordered a coffee, as well as the chicken and waffles). Left the waitress a really heavy tip and practically rolled out the joint. I was stuffed. \n\nI can't wait to to do it again.\n\nI also vote that you leave the hip hop on, but that's just my opinion. =P \n\nKeep up the good work, guys. Please don't get so cool that you have to relocate downtown. I like having a place with truly awesome food so close to home."

I am so spoiled by the comfortable decadence; while this seems contradictory the management & staff are so welcoming that the atmosphere feels like eating a meal at your friend's house ... your gourmet chef friend. No one will make you feel dumb when reciting the specials. All the burgers are yum, the duck fries are silly richness, & i could eat those duck pierogies almost every day. The wings are great, mac & cheeses rich & flavorful, potato croquettes with crab so filling (could use some salt). We also went for the taco showdown & loved the idea of guest chefs & special menus - nothing wrong with changing it up. Both the restaurant & bathroom are clean. I love the open kitchen - no shenanigans here! I'm a huge fan of BYOB - champagne with everything! We eat here fairly frequently & are never disappointed. Keep the yummy coming!"

The staff was very accommodating and friendly. \n\nThe food was served in huge portions. My bro had fried chicken that was served in huge pieces and I had the duck fat fries. The fries were great and the portion was humongous. The duck fat fries had an abundance of duck meat and cheese. If for nothing else but the duck fat fries, I would return if in the area. The menu was somewhat limited to me and the restaurant served bottled beverages."

The place is BYOB, so bring your own booze and let these local guys focus on the some of the best food combinations I've had the pleasure of eating.  I almost always get the the special because ... c'mon you cannot skip it! They do some kick ass fried chicken, fries you could easily overload on, burgers, giant BLTs made with bacon fat infused mayo, amazing chicken salad ... all these sandwiches served on brioche buns yummmmm.  Anyway that aside,  the full on entrees are bad ass.  You'll want to high five the chef when you leave...I know I used bass ass and kick ass twice, but that's why you need to be here ... now... because it's Sunday and their brunch will change your life.

Called for reservations early in the day (right after 11am) and there was only a reservation available for 8:30pm for two. We were seated right on time upon arrival. We ordered the duck fries which were good- the fries seemed homemade and very crispy which I liked. The Gouda is a good choice for cheese too, but the duck wasn't as flavorful as I would've expected. Next we ordered the tacos- this day was beef brisket. They were absolutely delicious! $23 for three tacos seems excessive but they were good enough that I can overlook the price this time. They were listed as MP which I think is a little silly unless they're serving lobster at some point. My husband got the Philly burger. It had bacon on it and was cooked perfectly but it was just \"good\", not as great as reviews made it out to be. The chocolate cake dessert was a waste of calories and money, it was bland without the flavoring (mint and raspberry) but the flavoring was too strong with mint. Service was excellent. I will return just because there was so much I want to try, including mac and cheese and Stocks pound cake French toast. I will update when I return. \n\n***Update- Today I called at 10:10am and asked for a reservation for 3 at 11:30am. They said they were busy but we could sit at the counter and reserve that space. One friend canceled and the other one was 15 minutes late because she drove past the place. They still kept our counter space for us and didn't complain which I appreciated. I had BIG intentions to have the Stock's Pound Cake French toast that was still currently on the downloadable version of their menu online, even though it wasn't listed at the restaurant or on the website itself. I expressed my disappointment and they gave me a complimentary Cuban egg roll which was absolutely amazing! The challah french toast with whip cream and maple syrup was delicious even if it wasn't as unique as I would've imagined the pound cake to be and the chicken and waffles were just the right amount of savory/sweet combo. They serve excellent coffee and service was friendly, funny and tolerated my pouting and sassiness with wit. I would say you definitely need to make reservations ahead of time during the busy shifts. The staff works together well and even though the place is small, can be hard to get into and loud at times (today we were part of the loud), I'll be back and highly recommend you try it out too!"

I love cheese but they seem to use it as a crutch in a lot of their dishes. The duck fries were swimming in melted cheese. The chorizo mac & cheese was equally drowned but that is expected. My problem is the cheese in that kind of quantities overwhelms the other flavors. The salad was good but nothing special and the house grind burger about the same still heavy handed with the cheese to the point where I could not identify that there was any garlic mayo on the thing. My husband's ruck burger was super dry more than the garnishes could make up for. Where this place really falls down is the service. Our waitress clearly just wanted the night to end and barely greeted us but she did come back a lot to try and take our order. We were not told about any other drink options besides the water that was given and had to ask for it to be refilled, we weren't told thank you when the check was brought or when we left. I mean I know these are little things but ya know it is the little things that make you feel welcome. On that note the manager was super great. He greeted us, sat us, gave us the menus & silverware, told us about the specials and was generally pleasant and clearly wanted our business. On the whole I guess I just want this place to be better than it currently is so I wish them the best and hope they stay & improve because we need more places willing to do new things in the area."

There are lots of seating for couples, with a couple of tables for bigger groups. It definitely feels a bit awkward being so close to other people bc you can literally hear everything they are saying. \n\nThe food here is so delicious! If you're looking for a unique burger/sandwich, this place delivers! They have the regular burgers like the pork roll, but also have new monthly burgers! I always get the burger of the month because how can you pass up a limited burger :) \n\nPork roll burger: 4/5 - my boyfriend loved this burger, while I thought it was good, I preferred what I had ordered.\n\nChicken fried sandwich: 4.5/5 - I am quite fond of chicken sandwiches (I love chicken in any form). I believe it was one of the monthly burgers, but don't quote me on that.\n\nSteak and Egg burger: 5/5 - Instead of regular ole buns, they had the steak and egg between crescent buns!! probably the best part for me, it was really good and I didn't even order this. \n\nGrilled chicken w/ chili peppers: 3.5/5 - I thought this was alright. While the chili peppers gave it a great taste, I just didn't like the grilled chicken enough to ever order it again. \n\nDUCK FAT FRIES: 5/5 - a must order! so good, I love fries and their fries are made perfectly.\n\nThe service here is awesome. They're quick and attentive. I'll be back just because my BF loves this place!"

First thing I could think was the great atmosphere. Was seated in less then 2 min by a very polite waitress, This was about 4:30pm. Then I notice about 20 min after sitting down that the servers putting reserved cards on 90% of the Tables. And this is on a Wed night. So if you plan on coming hear for Dinner. Eaither get hear early, or call ahead and make reservations, because the tables fill up fast, and only so many tables inside it's not a huge place, \n\nThe food and quality is what makes this place so popular to eat at. Everything is homemade. And is by far some of the best food you can get in the northeast philly area. \n\nI got the pork roll burger and duck fries. Both good. Consider getting one order of duck fries for 2 ppl. You get alot. Freinds of mying got the Mac and cheese. And the House Grind Burger. Said everything was good. Next time back like to try the wings. By what I hear they are really good. Didn't have any cheese cake available. So hopefully next time they do so I can give that a try. \n\nAll in All this place is a win win for anyone looking to get a good bite to eat if it's Brunch or Dinner. Do recommend it. \n\nIt's a spot you will see yourself coming back again to eat at. I'll be back to try other things in the near future."

We arrived at about 6:30 on a Friday and it was packed, but we still managed to score counter seating after only a short wait.\n\nWe were greeted right away and given water to start. We were waiting for 2 friends to join us, so we took some time to check out the decor. The place is actually pretty adorable, with a really on-trend DIY feel- decorative baskets filled with mason jar lids and cute little crates on the walls that look like they could have been repurposed from itty bitty palletes that contained nifty little knicknacks like a bobble head of one of the cooks (not kidding). Basically, if Pinterest were an actual place you could visit, it'd probably be here. \n\nAnd the food, oh my goodness. I had the Quack and Cheese, which was mac & cheese with smoked gouda, duck confit, panko bread crumbs and dried cherries. It was everything I'd ever hoped mac & cheese could be. We also split an order of the duck fat fries that were the best I'd ever had (sorry Jose Garces, time to step your game up bro!), and they even reheated great the next day. Hubby had the Blue Duck Sandwich, which I had a taste of and loved. The blueberry bbq sauce was really sweet and delicious, and the Swiss chard gave it plenty of bitterness to contrast. \n\nIt's evident that the menu at The Blue Duck is incredibly well thought out, with each element having its place in their dishes. I also really respect the fact that they somehow manage to use enough restraint to keep their menu simple and approachable. With their great food, comfortable atmosphere and warm accommodating staff, The Blue Duck is definitely going to become one of our regular spots. Thank you for choosing to make NE Philly your home!"

Looked great on paper. Not so great tasting. I thought it was a bit too smokey and the bits were chewy and very unappetizing. Would order again without bacon as crazy as it sounds. \nOrdered a burger. Bun was really cold for whatever reason. Burger patty was decent enough.

Then someone else comes up and says it will be a 20 minute wait and that table is now reserved...\n\n20 mins later, they seat us at the bar seats which pissed me off cause I couldnt talk to anyone besides the person next to me.

I tried to order from the lunch menu and was told they dont serve lunch right now by someone else... We ordered chicken and waffles, it was dry. Duck Benedict, which was served cold and they remade it, when it was remade, it was still cold and eggs were under cooked, dish still wasn't hot. Since i was sitting near the cooks, i saw they cook the duck and let it sit in a plate till its all used up, i saw it sitting for at least 10 minutes. which is why it the duck Benedict kept being cold.\n\nbut my friend was tired of waiting and ate it anyways..

For starters we had the Blue Duck fries and they did not disappoint, but seriously they were so flavorful, decadent, yet simple enough for my kids to enjoy. We also had an order of the Blue Moon Citrus wings and you could smell the Blue Moon in the wings and they had an exceptional crisp to them with citrusy sweet flavor that left me wanting more. At this point we've had a bottle of wine and the entrees are hitting the table. We had a pork roll burger ('14 Burger Brawl Champ, '15 Best in Philly Burger), and all I can say is WOW.  The meat blend was outrageous in the patty, spices were on point, and cooked to perfection. A sunny side up egg atop the meaty masterpiece put this sandwich over the top and has taken sole ownership of Best Burger on my list HANDS DOWN! The food was outrageous and the service was good too.

I love the idea of not having to go to the city and Blue Duck offers exactly that! We made reservations which are recommended for a Weekend night. The place is small and filled up quickly. There is a standard menu but there were many specials being offered and it was a tough decision! We went with the Philly burger, Fried  Chicken, Duck Fries and Fried cauliflower. All of these were winners! The duck fries had a smoky taste from the Gouda cheese. The duck was perfectly seasoned and the seasoning was spot on! I'm not a fried chicken girl but we tried it because they are known for it. The Sriracha that they soak the chicken in comes through after the first bite. It's initially sweet but then you get that kick. It's not deep fried. It's basically perfectly fried. The cauliflower, now that's deep fried deliciousness. All vegetables should taste this good. This dipping sauce was a flavored mayo. Yum! The burger had a tomato jelly that had a different texture the ketchup. A little rare for my liking but my dinner companion loved it! \n\nThe only down side to me was how close we sat to the next table. A little to close for my liking but we turned this into a positive by making some new friends. \n\nOur server was attentive, made great recommendations, and made us feel welcome.  Prices were fair.

        "text": "This place falls just short of being a five star venue, but at least they're headed in the right direction.\n\nIt's so great to know this place manages to exist in the culinary wasteland that is Northeast Philadelphia. If the crowds are any indication, people are starving for a food experience like they dish out here. Sure, their food can be called typical American fare, but they do it well and they do it uniquely. \n\nI really only have two major complaints. My biggest complaint is that their coffee is lacking. It kind of just tastes like burnt water, despite being the much loved Rival Brothers brand. I'm not sure if it's how they're brewing it here or the brand itself that isn't good, but don't think I'll ever order another cup of coffee here. Also the size of the restaurant is annoying, and much too small for the crowds that come here. Perhaps a move is in order? I understand that's easier said than done, so take my opinion with a grain of salt. \n\nHowever, the food is (mostly) phenomenal. Yes, I've only had brunch in the times I've gone, but I was amazed by how tasty and innovative the meals were and how cheap they were! They have Duck L'Orange pancakes, which are smothered in orange syrup that complements the shredded duck on top nicely. This dish would cost probably 15 dollars were it either in the suburbs or Center City; here it only costs seven dollars! Considering how large the portion was that is a huge discount. If you're hungry for a hearty meal I will suggest the Frankenwaffle, which is a brunch special they don't have all the time. It's a Belgian waffle covered in cheddar cheese, with two slices of scrapple and two sunny side up eggs on top. Sure, it sounds gross, but tastes marvelous. They also have fruity peddles encrusted french toast which is cute and super sugary. It's not my favorite dish but it's alright. I was only truly disappointed with one dish - their breakfast brisket quesadilla. It was underwhelming and just did not play up to the game of the rest of the dishes at this restaurant, so it could definitely use improvement. Let's just say it needed a lot more spice and a bigger portion of pico de gallo to accompany it. \n\nThis review will probably need an upgrade after I experience dinner service, but I can tell you that brunch is at least worth checking out. However, you might want to make a reservation; if you don't get there at 10 o'clock on the dot, you can forget about getting a table. There's some kinks to work out, but overall Blue Duck largely succeeds at what it sets out to do."

Also had the gnocchi, scallops, bolognese, duck Mac and cheese and the pork roll burger. All amazing- especially the pork roll burger! The plating is beautiful, you can tell the chef takes pride in his presentation and ingredients. I look forward to coming back and trying more things!"

And the Blue Duck is one of those places. So close to home that this just might become one of our top places to add in our favorite brunch restaurants list. We started off with water and coffee and Duck fries. Oh my God thee best fries I've ever eaten in my life needless to say. We could've eaten just that all day long. The wonderful waitress Sara then took our order, kindly refilled our drinks, and suggested the Franken Waffels. As I always like to try new things I went and ordered what Sara recommended and my lady ordered the chicken and waffles. When I tell you that I haven't had a banging ass breakfast better than what I ate... I truly mean it! I was in heaven. Best breakfast/brunch in town hands down. My lady enjoyed hers as well and brought some home. Not only do I give 5 stars to you guys but also 2 thumbs up for the experience and service we came across. Thank you!! You will be having us again."

I ordered the duck benedict, it was very good but not the largest portion so my hungry self was still hungry. Me and my 2 other friends decided to split the stocks french toast and I am so happy we did because that was perfect portion to split and gave me the sweet treat my taste buds were craving. Definitely try the stocks french toast, it's a must. \n\nThe place wasnt too crowded but it wasnt empty either. We had a reservation so I would suggest making one just to be safe. The service was great too, our waiter was perfect. We had left overs and forget them and he followed us out bringing them to us. \n\nSuper good quality food at an affordable price with great service. You really can't beat it, especially located in the \"far\" northeast Philadelphia, there arent too many quality places but the blue duck certainly is one of them."

We were just in last weekend for brunch and we love sitting at the counter (also easiest place to get sat at without a reservation)  But you get to watch the cooking happening which is entertaining to us.  We have only BYO'd here on two occasions but the food is a hangover must in my opinion.  Unique choices and always something different on special.  This will definitely remain a brunch spot for us, however dinner did not quite win us over on any of the 3 times we came in for dinner. Just ok, but my husband and I do consider ourselves food snobs because 1. we eat out a lot and 2. we are both good cooks ourselves. \n\nDefinitely worth a try, and don't forget the DUCK FAT FRIES!"

Our food took forever to come out & it wasn't even hot. And the service was terrible! First of all, the hostess didn't even great us properly with a hello, or a welcome or even a smile. And the waitress was no better. She did not smile once and as we were asking questions about the menu she seemed like she was annoyed or in a rush to get away from our table. I'm sorry but if you're a waitress you should be personable, but that's just me. She wasn't pleasant at all & didn't come back to check on us once! We were very disappointed with our first experience and we complained to the manager who apologized for the inconvince and removed the cold dish from our check. He must have said something to our waitress about the complaint because she was a completely different person when she returned to our table. At least she corrected her mistake at the end but this type of service is unacceptable & should not be tolerated. If they don't properly train their staff, this place will be run down to the ground because of poor service. We will defiantly be back to try again because the food was so good but I will make sure to get a different server next time!"

I've made it a point to try something different every time I've visited and I have yet to be disappointed. The pork roll burger is delicious and sriracha spicy and VERY messy so be prepared. The fried chicken sandwich is perfectly crispy. The House Grind is juicy and a safe bet for any burger lover out there. The General Tso wings are reminiscent of Korean BBQ wings and the General Tso chicken tacos that my friend had looked yummy too. The Blue Duck fries are a must. I repeat. You MUST get them. All the mac and cheeses are delightful, but I particularly enjoyed the green curry mac and cheese which have a hint of heat and curry flavor and are topped with crispy chickpeas and chicken. But you can't go wrong with any of their velveeta-esque shell mac and cheese. They are BYOB which is always fun when you're prepared and if you aren't they have lemonades, iced teas, and adorable mini glass coke bottles that you can pour into a mason jar. The staff here are so nice and patient, especially when we were there for a few different lunch parties with larger groups. The restaurant is decorated in a light country style which pairs perfectly with the mason jars and galvanized metal wine buckets they provide. I will definitely be returning! The Blue Jawn...I have my eye on you."

The restaurant is very noisy the location has horrible acoustics. They need to add some sound dampeners to improve the situation.  Also they desperately need to change the playlist on their iPod, I like Biggie & The Wu tang clan but I don't feel like listening to it while eating dinner with my parents who are 60 years old.

But believe me and whatever they say about the fries. Blue duck fries can be a meal itself if you have a small appetite. There are some fries with more salt that others but its a seasoning no big deal. \nNow if you like me and need a little more. Sure order either the quack n cheese OR burger (I got smoked bbq pork). Ordering both is way too much. I thought I could handle it. \nQuack n cheese (green bowl) has portobello mushroom, scallion, dried cherries. \nSmoke bbq pork is served on potato bread. The salty from the fries goes well with the pickles. \nHappy with my choices. Left bloated \n\nUpdate: quake n cheese w/ fries is too much to handle. My family tried to pass me the burgers, nope.

That's good for me as I don't like wasabi that burns your mouth. The meals were excellent. I had the duck which was covered in a sesame breadcrumbs and was cooked perfectly.

Huge portion with so much flavor - you definitely need a fork for this dish.\n\nThis restaurant really stands out in a neighborhood of pizza joints and delis - it does look out of place.  But word travels fast, and judging by the crowded dining area and full parking lot, I'm not the only one that made a trip to try Blue Duck.\n\nBesides duck, they seem to also specialize in wings and mac and cheese, as they offer a variety of housemade sauces and styles. Mac and cheese dish is made with shells, which I thought I wouldn't like. But I was proven wrong. Very flavorful and the shells really carry the cheese sauce well into my mouth.\n\nThe wings were crispy and the blue cheese was excellent. Not the best wings i've ever had, but still good.\n\nI SHOULD'VE gotten their famous Blue Jawn burger like I planned, but opted for an off-menu special - some grounded duck burger. While it was good and I really tasted the duck in the ground meat, it was too well for me and it definitely didn't satisfy my burger craving. Good nonetheless, just not a hamburger replacement. Also, the burger did NOT come with fries.  Weird.\n\nBut it's not like I could've eaten more fries after the Blue Duck fries. That was definitely my fave of the night - melted cheese, fresh cut fries, duck confit. It was divine, and I would come back solely for these fries.\n\nIf you like duck in the least, you should definitely make a visit here. And don't forget to bring a bottle or two: it is BYOB."

Beef patty with ground porkroll mixed in... yum! \nThe service was great too. The only thing that kinda turned me off was that we were sitting literally 4 inches from the table next to us and the server had to hand food over my head to their table."

I'm sure the meal would have been even better if it had been eaten at the location BUT it was still amazing brought home. The only complaint any of us had was that pickles were put in the container for the porkroll burger, making the bun soggy. The plus side was the burger itself was so delicious it was hard to even focus on the soggy bun aspect. We tried the porkroll burger, porkroll egg rolls, fruity pebble French\nToast, salt & pepper fries, and strawberry & banana pancakes. All phenomenal, would recommend all the meals and of course those delicious fries with cheese sauce. Can't wait till our next brunch here (hopefully dining in)!"

You need to make reservations. \n\nTable was ready by our reservation time.\n\nFood was great I had their seafood stew. Which reminds me more of an Italian seafood pasta without the presence of cheese. I also shared a serving of their brisket mac and cheese it had little slices of jalape\u00f1os on it that gave it this extra zing. \nMy boyfriend had the pork roll burger. He loved it. It didn't come with fries though and it was kinda small. He enjoyed it immensely and said it was satisfying regardless of the size.\n\nSince it was my birthday they gave me a complimentary piece of cake. It was a whiskey honey cake. It was just delicious you could taste the whiskey but it was so buttery. \n\nI can't wait to go back."

Don't judge the book by its cover yet, because the reviews are right: it's totally worth it. \n\nIt was a hot Saturday morning but I took the pup and my girlfriends and I sat outside under the shade, which was nice. We were surprised by how many specials the waitress had to read us. They all sounded amazing. Quickly, we realized we all wanted to try the duck fat fries, so that became our appetizer (at 10:30am, no less). They were probably some of the best fries I've ever had. Topped with delicious melted REAL cheese, shredded duck and scallions, the fries were also perfectly fried to a nice texture. \n\nAs for our brunch entrees, I went with the frankenwaffle special, which was a savory bacon waffle with homemade scrapple and fried eggs. After the fries, I figured Blue Duck would be a good place to try scrapple for the first time. Is it supposed to be really mushy in the center? It seemed very thick-cut, and I wished for more of the fried outer layer. The waffle also could have used more of a bite but it was rather soft. But the flavors were all good with a dab of sriracha. \n\nMy friend got the duck benedict, which looked amazing, but the dish was on the smaller side so I felt bad asking for a bite. My other friend got the chicken and waffles, in which she also enjoyed the chicken more than the soft waffle (made softer by loads of syrup). Tip: order syrup on the side. \n\nWe would definitely come back and try some of the other things on the menu, especially their sandwiches that looked really good. With a side of those DUCK. FAT. FRIES."

The hostess took care of us and seated us at the counter in front of the cook which was great. We placed our drink orders and looked over the menu. The missus suggested we try the blue duck fries. She ordered the short rib and egg quesadilla. Me and my younger son both ordered one of the specials a waffle infused with bacon topped with scrapple, sunny side up eggs and cheese sauce. My other son ordered the chicken and waffles.\n\nThe missus said the short rib and egg quesadilla was a large portion and tasty. You may want to request additional sour cream and salsa on the side. Nice breakfast twist since it has egg in it! \n\nMy son said the Belgian waffles were light and fluffy. Was dissapointed the fried chicken had a sweet flavor to it when I was looking for savory notes to compliment the maple syrup/waffles.\n\nThe blue duck fries were amazing! Hand cut fries tossed in duck fat, smoked Gouda cheese sauce and shredded duck confit with scallions. \n\nThe special was delicious also. The waffle was light and fluffy, however I didn't taste the bacon. The scrapple was prepared well not overly fried. The sunny side up eggs and the cheese sauce tied everything together. \n\nI will definitely be back to try the wings and the burgers!"

Our group ordered duck fries, wings, two sandwiches, and macaroni and cheese as well.  Everything was delicious and the service was fantastic.  Additionally, they are extremely kid friendly.  We had two babies with us and saw three other families with babies and small children in the restaurant at the same time.\n\nI especially love this restaurant because it feels like a restaurant you would find in Center City or Northern Liberties - but it's in the Northeast.

The tables will require you to get intimate with strangers as they feel like they are sitting with you. I thought the menu was a bit overpriced, but I guess duck costs more here than in China town?? We started with the duck fries which were delicious, then we moved onto the quack and cheese and Brussel sprouts, and finished with the wild boar burger. I must say that the tomato jam on the boar burger had a fantastic flavor that offset the taste perfectly the quack and cheese just became too much duck and I couldn't eat much of it. Overall the place is decent but the duck for every course gets old for me."

I had the sweet potato gnocchi, my mom had the portabella burger(she got it on a wrap instead of the bun) and my daughter got the porkroll burger.I loved the duck fries would definitely recommend them, they were cooked just right with great flavor. The gnocchi was good and flavorful as well just a very small portion size. The porkroll burger was definitely a work of art for a burger lover, I was skeptical about the egg but it did complete the sandwich, very rich, only complaint is the bun was not manly enough for that burger!!!! The portabella has this sauce of black bean corn salsa, braised kale and red roasted aoli that had amazing flavor. We had the ginger mango tea, which was the special drink of the day, it was pretty good, I think the pitcher should have been stirred better, ginger taste was a lil strong, came unsweetened which is fine but that was not told to us before receiving our tea. We got the funnel cake(can't remember the name of it) for dessert and it was just O K it was really doughy inside. The staff was super friendly and accommodating and the entire place was clean(even the restroom). My only major complaint was that the chairs were EXTREMELY uncomfortable!!! Overall, this place is super cute and the flavors are blended perfectly just the portion sizes are SMALL and so is the restaurant for the crowd sizes it attracts. I definitely think like any new business they are going to experience some growing pains but I'm glad a place like this is now in the NE and can't wait to try more menu items."

My husband made our reservations on open table and Nick remembered it was our 19th anniversary and presented a complimentary slice of chocolate cake for our special day! It was rich, chocolatey and incredible. The food is delicious and if your not sure what to get, take the suggestion from your wait staff because they really know the menu. We started with the Duck Fries and potatoes croquettes. Both were delicious. My husband ordered the pork roll burger and loved it. I ordered the chicken parm tacos-the chicken was fried to perfection and had a wonderful balance of cheese and sauce (Liz's recommendation and glad I got it). It does get noisy, but I'm used to that from restaurants in Center City. The chefs behind the open kitchen are excellent and add pizzaz as they're preparing the food.Total for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, iced tea, dessert milkshake-plus tip-70.00. A must try restaurant!

We shared two different appetizers which were very good. We had duck ravioli and fried wings with the wasabi blue cheese sauce which was not too hot. That's good for me as I don't like wasabi that burns your mouth. The meals were excellent. I had the duck which was covered in a sesame breadcrumbs and was cooked perfectly. My son had a veal chop and said his was cooked just he expected. My daughter-in-law had the boar burger and ate it very quickly so it had to be as delicious as she said it was. Reservations are needed. I highly recommend the Blue Duck and cannot wait to go back again. Added: the brunch menu is also better than average. Prices are reasonable.

Living closer to downtown there so many awesome restaurant options but in the North East where I work it's mostly chains restaurants or less than exciting pizza/bar food type places.  Now getting my co-works to branch out of just a basic salad or sandwich can be challenging at times.  But despite their preference for boring food choices they seem to be ok with the small and unique menu offered at Blue Duck Sandwich Company.  And one of them actually frequents the place regularly.\n\nLove the d\u00e9cor of the place has a very farm to table feel to it.  It's very bright inside; the only issue I have is that both times we went it's been extremely cold to the point where I debated eating with my coat on.  They were out of their signature sandwich and the produce truck hadn't come so no tomatoes for the bbblt on our second visit which was a little disappointing since two of us planned to try the blue duck sandwich.\n\nThe Blue Duck Fries honestly could be a meal in itself, there huge the 1st time the 4 of us split them the second time I went I actually just got it as a meal neither time were they all finished.  I've tried both the bruschetta wing and general tso, both were nice and crispy but the general tso were infinitely better.  Two of my co-works are picky about Chicken Salad and raved about the club, so if you're picky too this one might be worth a try.  I really enjoyed the portabella burger the roasted red pepper aoli really topped it off.  Both the fried chicken sandwich and quack & cheese looked yummy.  If you're not into cheese the cheese on the salt and pepper fires comes on the side.  It's a different sauces from the blue duck fires both are tasty I can decided which I like better probably leaning towards the one on the blue duck fires."

We ordered the blue duck fries and a couple sandwiches. The fries arrived before the sandwiches -\u00a0a good thing because we were super hungry. Said fries were covered in melted cheese sauce and shredded duck. Somehow, they were also still crunchy. Best fries I've had in a while. \n\nThere was quite a bit of time before our sandwiches arrived, which is fine, but this is when I started wishing we had brought some beer along. Mental note for next time! I opted for the fried chicken sandwich but requested a wheat wrap. It was delicious! The ranch dressing from the coleslaw had a slightly sweeter flavor than I was expecting but it was very tasty. The chicken was excellent.
