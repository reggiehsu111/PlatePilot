Most of them below my radar.\nThe Love is different.  \n  We had a Father's Day lunch that was exceptional.\nThere is little left off the menu and we were hard pressed to make a choice from the wonderful selections listed.  Our waiter was professional and accommodating.  Lovely atmosphere, light and bright.  I was amazed that the inside of my omelet was HOT. A little surprise thrown in with my Potatos..........roasted peppers, and onions.\nGreens on every plate. Mine had warm spinach salad as well. My husband had the Belgium waffles made with corn meal and garnished with Blueberry butter.  They use our favorite La Columbe coffee.\nNothing left to wish for."

The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It's very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef's pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I'm not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it's also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it's as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I'm not totally sure. I'll definitely be back, and I hope the menu prices find an equilibrium with the awesome vibe and food--I'd love to make it a real regular haunt."

When I made my reservation, I made a note of those celebrations and upon being greeted by the hostess that was the first thing they addressed with my sweet Papa! \n\nThe ambience is really hip, and it's a fairly intimate setting. We were seated in their booth style cushioned seats which was very comfortable. I am a booth girl all the way!\n\nI ordered he shrimp and grits with baby buttermilk biscuits and my Dad ordered the catfish and hush puppies in his true southern style. Can we talk about those biscuits?! So delicious. Words cannot express why I ate 5 of them in one sitting. The shrimp and grits were great, and that's coming from someone who NEVER eats grits. My Dad was less impressed with the catfish and hush puppies, but that's coming from someone who was born and raised in the South. I tried the hush puppies as well and they paled in comparison to the biscuits. \n\nOur server was very sweet and fairly attentive given the packed restaurant. For the total experience I would return. If I want truly amazing southern food (despite their menu) I would go elsewhere."

Nothing on the menu really spoke to me as something I just had to have, but he had really been wanting to try this place. I\"m glad I listened! We started with the duck salad - fantastic! We had the lobster spaghetti and the crab pasta special as entrees - both good but the lobster spaghetti was the winner. We also finished with a cheese plate and the cookie tray - I was skeptical that a cheese plate could be $20 good, but it absolutely was! Definitely a pricier dinner - but all high quality ingredients and worth the money. Good service as well - paced the different courses well and check on us just enough. Will definitely be back!"

The host was welcoming and the support staff was attentive and aware what was going on around them.  Staff gets a 5 star or (Starr)..lol\nNow lets talk about the food. First off, our meals were not bad. They were average.  They did however, lack flavor.  It might sound strange to say this, but our food and the space lacked identity. I feel like all Starr restaurants are known to have an identity and the food reflects that identity. This was definitely a weak point. This place was \"good\" but not what I assumed a Starr restaurant would be about.  We did attend there brunch a few time and thought it was very good, our meals at dinner were uneventful and a little  disappointing."

I thought it was pretty good, a lot of interesting textures and bites but a little to acidic. The hazelnut and ricotta ravioli though blew my socks off. Only came with 5-6 of them but they were fantastic and rich.\n\nFor an entree we shared the Salmon with artichokes, and potatoes. Though I heard the Fried chicken is a marquee item, I felt in the mood for something slightly healthier. The broth served underneath the salmon was delicious and the salmon itself was cooked to perfection. I wish it came with crostini's or something to soak up that tasty garlic-clam broth!\n\nDefinitely need to come back and try new dishes AND for brunch. The ricotta ravioli and Salmon are 'must-gets'."

A custom made over proofed rye made specifically for The Love is the standout ingredient in this perfect Manhattan. \n\nThe food, not surprisingly, is well executed and was absolutely delicious.

We bought a \"can\" of wine to split between the two of us which was unique and different. The quality of that too was very good. However the menu was limited for vegetarians though the restaurant really tried to accommodate. I had the kale risotto which was very filling. My date (who is also vegetarian) had a tofu steak. Th tofu steak was very well done, of good consistency, and had barbecue sauce. I wasn't a fan of the barbecue sauce because it think it could be better nightlights with an Asian or Mexican style Barbeque sauce. We also had the torched broccoli and crudit\u00e9s platter and rolls with chive butter for appetizers. All these were good though I expected the crudit\u00e9s to be pickled and they we're not.

We started off by ordering 3 apps: the pierogies, crispy duck salad and cheese board. All of these items were delicious, however the portions of the cheese were completely underwhelming. Four people were suppose to share the cheese board. While the presentation was cute with the mouse shaped goat cheese, the portions of the individual cheeses seemed as if they were fit for a mouse! Each person basically got a crumb of cheese to taste. Moving on to the entrees, two of us ordered the scallops, one person ordered the lamb and another ordered the beef stroganoff. The scallops were good, but the best dish was the beef. We have dined all over the city and the country. The aspect about The Love that left us with the poorest taste in our mouth was the fact that this place charges $1 per person for water (still or sparkling). Mind you, it's not bottled still or sparkling, it's super filtered Philadelphia water. To top it off, there is no complimentary bread or rolls served. You must pay $5 for the Parker house rolls with chive butter, which, in my opinion, were not worthy of the price tag. Overall, the food was good, not great and we do not plan to recommend or return. At $200 per couple, these ancillary charges made us feel as though we were being nickeled and dimed."

Took them 45mins to get our cocktails, granted when they finally did they realized they were giving subpar service and comped the drinks. So kudos for doing something right. The lobster pasta was mediocre at best, somewhat fishy and expensive for a tiny portion. The trout was delicious and the lamb dishes were decent, but nothing amazing. I wouldn't rush back.

We started with the cheese plate- easily the best we've had- and making a mouse out of the goat cheese was a whimsical touch. Next we shared the duck salad- I was less than excited, because I didn't think I liked duck, but I was wrong. It was really good and was confit-prepared. I had the whole, smoked trout and the fish was enormous; I couldn't finish it all. It was served with a maple-flavored farro...cut with something I can't recall that made it sweet and sour. It was a nice compliment to the smokey fish. Hubs had the filet with blue cheese sauce. Delicious, but a rather small cut for $40...and the only reason this isn't a 5-star review.

We got a very nice quiet table in the back of the restaurant were we ordered drinks and appetizers. \n\nStarting with the $20 Manhattan and a small orange cocktail both just amazing we moved onto the park house rolls, special of the night curry mussels and the butternut squash ravioli. All just amazing! The butternut squash ravioli was just to die for. \n\nThe service was spot on with an fantastic waiter and staff that always showed up at the right time.\n\nOur main courses were just as good and I won't bother going into detail apart from this. My girlfriend order a salmon dish that was the special of the night and we both know what we like. We will eat 99.9% of anything put in front of us. However, tonight was the .1% we both can't stand dill and did not even think to ask if the salmon had dill on it. Well it was covered in dill. I mean dill from back fin to snout. She took one bite and could not take another. I said \"it can't have that much dill\" and took my own bite. The salmon was like butter and the beets just perfect. But, it was dill city baby with the next stop being the dill express. I couldn't do it. As good as the salmon was I could not get past the dill. That said, this was not on the restaurant, it was just not our thing. We have never sent anything back before but, with some embarrassment about ordering something we both could not stand our waiter was just great and before we could even say we did not like it he picked the salmon dish up took her order for the scallops and they did not even charge us for he salmon. It was so very nice of them and even if they had charged us for the salmon I would not of been upset because we did order it and there was nothing wrong with the dish itself the dish was just not in our taste. Yet, the short rib beef stroganoff and the scallops were spot on and I would recommend them to anyone.\n\nTo close it up, dessert was to die for and the carrots cake Sunday was just so damn good.\n\nGive this place a try and don't forget to get a reservation way in advance."

Also, there seemed to be a lot of people working that night. They were literally tripping over each other. It was amusing at first until it wasn't. \nFood/Drink - I started with a Sunset boulevard (i think it was called) a champagne drink, which was good and my friend stuck with wine all night which she enjoyed. She couldn't decide between two options so the waitress let her sample some before she chose which she appreciated. \nThe food was overall very good. We started with the Gnocco Fritto which was one of my favorite things. I've never had this before so I didn't know what to expect. They were hollowed pastry shells with a side of the mortadella and onion jam. I wasn't sure how to eat it so we tore the shells apart, stuffed them with the meat and slathered jam on everything. So good. I'd get this again in a heartbeat. \nWe also split the Pierogi with Panna cotta and caviar. This was also good. The creamy panna cotta and the salty caviar over the pierogi was very enjoyable. I'd get this again also.\nFor mains, we split the Ricotta Ravioli and the Salmon. The ravioli was easily my least favorite thing. If it had rosemary in it, we couldn't taste it. The hazelnuts gave it a nice texture but compared to the other 3 dishes we had it was just underwhelming. The salmon was fantastic. It had a nice charred skin and was cooked just as it should have been. The BEST part of the salmon is the crispy brussles sprouts with the soy balsamic glaze. It was the tastiest part of the entire meal and I almost licked that part of my plate clean. There was a decent serving of it on the plate but i wanted more. So good.\nFinally for dessert we ordered the carrot cake sundae which was 2 scoops of cream cheese ice cream with some wet walnuts. We didn't finish this and it wasn't worth ordering. \nOverall, 3.5 stars a nice experience. This would've been a solid 4 stars without the water, 20% less attentive staff (which I feel is an odd thing to say but its just how I felt) and had we passed on dessert. We paid a little over $100/person (with tip) for water, 2 drinks each, split 2 appetizers, 2 mains and dessert. If I ever find myself back there, I'd probably re-order the GnoccoFritto and Salmon.  \nI'd definitely pass on the $1 water."

Our server was extremely awkward and couldn't even explain what the special was to us in a way that we could even begin to understand. The cheese board came out and the manager who delivered it to us couldn't even tell us what the cheeses were without having to look at a note card. Now for the most interesting part of our dinner. The chairs here are extremely wobbly, and an older male fell out of his chair during our dinner. A stretcher had to come through the restaurant to get him off of the floor. This was my boyfriend and I's two year anniversary. Needless to say, it was completely ruined by our dinner at the Love.\n\nAnd then to top off our experience, they presented us with two pieces of brittle for our anniversary. After everything that happened with our meal, you would think they would at least give us a normal/acceptable dessert."

The decor is pretty nice, but I wasn't particularly impressed by my beef papperdelle. Most of umami  flavor came from fried shallots, and the pasta was sadly lacking in the fresh chewy texture and taste I would expect for a $25 plate. I think they don't make it in house here, and it was limp/over cooked. \n\nDrinks are good here with the strawberry basil mojito making up for a bit of my disappointment."

The dessert, the cracker Jax sundae, was great as well.  \n\nMy one big issue with this restaurant is the pricing.  For what was supposed to be \"your neighborhood restaurant\" the prices are way inflated.  30 dollars for fried chicken?  We spent about 90 bucks a person for a meal in quality that is met at many other restaurants in Philly for 20-30 less a person.   This will definitely prohibit us from coming here regularly. \n\nPricing aside, the restaurant is excellent and would still highly recommend."

Last time I went, I ordered the chedder black pepper waffles with maple apples, fried rosemary, and cayenne-cinnamon pecans. Highly recommended.

There is a bar adjacent to the host area with limited seating and the general dining area is inviting but not pretentious. The restaurant isn't overly spacious and though our table was a bit small it was nicely located near a window. \n\nThe service was attentive and the pace was good. \nThe menu features a variety of appetizers, pasta, entrees, and vegetable sides, many of which seem to be comfort food or southern inspired dishes. \n\nWe enjoyed the Parker House Rolls, served in a cast iron skillet and accompanied with chive butter. They were tasty and a nice starter.\n\nThe caramelle pasta was probably the least inspired. Although it was nicely presented the portion was minimal and though the butter sauce was warm, the pasta twists themselves were cold which was somewhat off putting. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was actually the seasonal chicken. I'm not a huge fan of chicken but this chicken was fried in buttermilk, boneless, and was soft and flavorful. The accompanying grits were a bit heavy on the butter, but okay. The collard greens were fine, the comeback sauce was well prepared. \n\nFor a side vegetable we tried the torched broccoli with hot sauce. The presentation was a little unsightly, it was more like broccoli tossed haphazardly in sauce, but it was tasty. \n\nOur drinks were good, the restaurant has a good enough variety of cocktails, wine and other libations to get along with, though I wouldn't characterize the pours as particularly generous for some of the prices. \n\nOur dessert consisted of the Dirt Sundae, of chocolate mousse and topped with crushed cookies/fruit. The presentation was nice and the mousse was well flavored and a good way to conclude the meal. \n\nAll in all, I think the ambiance and service were where the restaurant excelled. We enjoyed most of the fare, with the exceptions noted above. I would be curious to try some additional entr\u00e9e dishes or return for brunch."

It takes a jazzy and classy approach to seemingly medieval archways and exposed brick, and throws it in the middle of Rittenhouse. If feels like you're dining in the countryside like Napa Valley but the bustle of the Philadelphia streets are just outside. \n\nThe menu is awful, not the options it offers but the literal menu itself. It's hard to focus on any item because it all blends together like some textual hotpot. It forgets that capital letters are used for emphasis, and seemingly plays tricks on you as you try to finish a single line without jumping to the next. \n\nThey don't offer any of the typical alcoholic brunch drinks which I guess adds to the jazzy allure, but it means alcohol at brunch is gonna cost ya roughly $13 a drink. I get it, but it's frustrating. \n\nAs for the food, I went with the burger and it didn't disappoint. It's filling but not a very large portion so if you're looking for a heavier option, I'd suggest something else. The cheese fondue dip was the most intriguing part, a fun, richer alternative an aioli for the burger and/or ketchup for dipping potatoes. \n\nNot sure I would return any time soon before trying some other restaurants around the city, but it's worth a visit."

It was a Tuesday evening, so not insanely busy. I had marked \"anniversary\" while making the reservation on Open Table, and they asked again when calling to confirm if we were celebrating our anniversary that night. \n\nThe hostess was very welcoming and chatted to us for a bit as they cleared our table. Didn't offer to take our coats, though, and I noticed there was a coat closet on the way out. We ordered drinks and it took 10+ minutes to receive them. No biggie, though. Our server was nice enough but fairly unremarkable. We didn't see much of him. \n\nWe had the cast-iron rolls, duck salad, fried chicken, and lamb. The food was cooked and seasoned well and the drinks were good, but both were definitely overpriced. Dessert was pleasant. \n\nNo mention of our anniversary that night, so it didn't feel special in any way. Just another night going out to eat. Why even ask/confirm if you're celebrating anything? For the amount you end up spending, I would expect a higher level of service.\n\nAll in all, you're better off going to Bud & Marilyn's for similar food and a more enjoyable experience (better prices, too).

The menu is formatted very simply (stark white with square-ish blue type) and the food is simple as well, but done up gorgeously with fun and unexpected twists. For example, torched broccoli with hot sauce? YUM. Habanero butter for my cornbread? YES PLEASE. Everyone's dinner was spectacular. Also, they have a lovely selection of tea and dessert, which we indulged in. Lastly, the service was just lovely. A little slow, but they were incredibly busy for late on a Thursday night. Please treat yourself and go to The Love!!"

That says volumes about the team concept this place embodies.\nNow on to the food! Everything we got was excellent from the Turkey Melt to the Shrimp and Celery Soup to the Pierogies with Caviar.\nThere were so many choices and we delighted in all of our meals as we plate shared to spread the LOVE!\nMake a point of checking the great vibe at The Love."

Asked for second glass of wine and never received it, birthday dessert given to wrong person even though I specified the bday person, had to ask for water refills. It could have been because they were extremely busy but was surprised that service was lacking\n3. Food was good ... not amazing or exceptional just good. I think for us this is a one and done.

The meal was running an A+ until dessert. The chocolate slice and carrot cake were at best disappointing. Next time we will skip dessert."

My boyfriend and I came here for brunch and ordered the hush puppies with honey butter and beer battered squash rings with port wine cheddar schmear as our appetizer. Phenomenal. For my entree, I ordered the lemon poppyseed pancakes with sour cherry sauce. The pancakes were dense and filling and large enough that I was able to take half of the order home for a second meal. Definitely shareable if that's the route you want to go. My boyfriend ordered the turkey melt which he thoroughly enjoyed and also struggled to finish. For cocktails, I went with The Fig and the Lemon which has gin and limoncello. I enjoyed this so much I may or may not have ordered three. He ordered the Love Sazerac, which is his go to drink whenever we go down South. Cocktails were pricey but definitely worth exploring in my opinion. Our waitress was also friendly and attentive without being overbearing and we never had to wait too long for any of our orders to come out. Overall it was a delicious meal with no complaints."

I was dining with 2 other people, we ordered 2 pasta dishes to share and it was barely enough for 1 person. The portions are very small and everything is buried in creamy sauces that mask the actual flavor of what you are served. We ordered chicken next, which was tasteless but the worst part was at the end: dessert. I believe that vanilla ice cream with caramel at McDonald's might actually taste better than what we had there. Final bill over 200$ and we only had 1 drink each. Tried once, not going back."

We skipped having a starter, I had cedar smoked whole trout which was cooked to perfection. They seasoned the fish with lemon and herbs and the pecans on top were a great touch. I did not find the farro side salad to be very tasty. Others on the table had the lamb and the pork chop with the pork chop being the best pork I have ever tasted. Dessert was nothing special and I didn't find there to be as much love or effort put into this course. We had the carrot cake and salted chocolate caramel slice. It was a disappointing finish to a lovely meal. Overall the service was not great. Drinks were slow and the waiter was not very knowledgeable about the dishes. Our table was also in a terrible spot with the waiters passing by every minute and hitting my chair. There was not a very good atmosphere inside, loud music and it felt like they were just trying to sit as many people as possible in a restaurant. \nGo to the love for the great food but skip dessert and don't expect a romantic or personal experience."

I was still hungry, so I ordered dessert (Cranberry butter cake).  It was good, but again pricey.  The service was attentive and courteous.

And, the perfectly crisped duck salad with butterscotch pears and a ginger dressing, which was easily shareable. \n\nMy veal lasagne with ricotta, green kale and basil noodles with tomatoes melted in my mouth. It was heavenly and a must try! The acorn squash pomodoro with fresh burrata and tomato sauce was rich and creamy but not heavy. The Brussels sprouts were fried and but not overly (perhaps I delude myself) and finished with a soy glaze. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the cranberry brown butter bar with organic caramel and toasted pecan ice cream. A friend sent us the \"Not your neighbor's cookie plate\", and it wasn't. A combination of sweet, small delights featuring salted caramel and chocolate chip cookies and other pastries covered the plate and were a nice finish to the meal, along with my freshly brewed espresso.  \n\nI look forward to returning.

So smooth+soul warming. \n\nI quickly warmed up and relaxed, and neglected to take photos of our food. My friend and I both wanted to eat fairly light and we shared the Gnudi (the Love's spin on Gnocchi) which was tender and melt in your mouth delicious, made with with sage, Saba and toasted chestnut truffle brown butter sauce. It was so light we could almost forget we were eating pasta. \n\nWe also had the torched broccoli in a house hot sauce.

The menus are very similar (fried chicken, scallops, trout, pierogies, short rib stroganoff, blue cheese salad) and I have to say that B&Ms does these things as well as - or better than - The Love at a more reasonable price point, in a more comfortable space.\n\nDrinks were delicious - we tried the Government Mule, A Very Good Bourbon Drink, and Rum No Coke. Beware the $1/pp house filtered water, unless you're into that kind of thing.\n\nFood was for the most part, \"fine\" - the smoked whole trout was a standout - large fish and very tasty, and the poke was nicely presented but pretty standard. The gnocco fritto was ok (still confused on how to eat it), the fried chicken was good (though the grits and collards were not great, and for $30 we expected better), and the carrot cake sundae probably wasn't worth ordering.\n\nThe two of us were seated at one of the small tables on the outside of the dining room with both chairs facing into the restaurant as if on the sidewalk at Parc. That was kind of strange, and a little bit uncomfortable for our backs to be up against the wall like that, instead of facing each other. It's great when you're people-watching at brunch on Rittenhouse Square, but weird for an intimate dinner with your fiance.\n\nI will say, the service was great - everyone was very friendly from the moment we walked in. The waitstaff was very nice and attentive, knowledgable about the menu, and quick to take away dishes that we were finished with to make more space on our tiny table.\n\nOverall, not a BAD experience, but we probably won't be running back (we'll be running to Bud and Marilyn's instead!)"

I've been let down in the past by fancy brunch spots that end up underdelivering and overcharging for their overcooked eggs and well cocktails. Fortunately, The Love was such a game-changer for me that I am seriously reconsidering my intrinsic vendetta against the concept of brunch. Talk about an egg-sistential crisis.\n\nThe Love is situated in one of the intersections right off of Rittenhouse, perfectly nestled between Tria and The Dandelion. Steven Starr sure knows how to find great locations for his restaurants. Street parking was surprisingly easy to find, but I image we lucked out - this is a really hot area and it might make more sense to ride share on a weekend morning. We got there at around 11AM on a Saturday and were greeted with a cozy speakeasy-esque bar on our left, and the absolutely beautiful bespoke dinning room on our right. We were a party of four and were seated within five minutes into a comfy couch-booth a bit further into the restaurant. I truly commend the staff here, as they did an incredible job making us feel comfortable and giving us significant attention and focus during our brunch.\n\nThe menu is a kerning nightmare but very trendy and cool - it's kind of hard to read the actual menu items given the variety of fonts, but I personally think that adds to a bit of the charm of the place/encourages you to ask your server questions. We all ordered cocktails, mine of which was a Bloody Mary. It was one of the tastiest drinks I've had in a while; one note is that I do recall my sister saying she wasn't a huge fan of the mule. We ordered a muffin basket for the table - I highly recommend getting one of these to start, as they are in a variety of flavors and are so warm, soft, and fluffy. It's an incredible way to start the meal and they are perfect to share. I ordered the lemon poppy seed pancakes for my main course, and was so taken with the dish that I literally had to stop myself from ordering a second one. The cherry glaze over the top pancake was so flavorful, but what was even more astonishing was the fact that every subsequent pancake tasted equally as moist and flavorful. I can also attest that the other savory options that my family had were equally as delicious.\n\nOverall, we had an incredible time at The Love. The service was impeccable, the food was delicious and prompt, and the environment of the restaurant really makes you enjoy taking some time out to unwind on a weekend morning/afternoon and enjoy some of the finer things in life.\n\nOne last note: I have since gone again to The Love and they were incredibly accommodating to a larger party of 8."

It was superb, especially considering that they're likely still working through the kinks that anyone goes through during the first few month's of business.\n\nI had the following and in this order:\n\nA VERY GOOD BOURBON DRINK. JIM BEAM BLACK, GRAN CLASSICO BITTER, IRIS VERMOUTH, APPLE CIDER $14\n\nLABOR OF LOVE. EIGHT GREATS. ALL AMERICAN ARTISAN CHEESE BOARD $20\n\nLOVEBIRD. OUR SEASONAL CHICKEN: BUTTERMILK FRIED GREEN CIRCLE CHICKEN, GRITS, COLLARDS AND COMEBACK SAUCE $29\n\nSHORT RIB STROGANOFF. COLA GLAZE, WIDE DUTCH NOODLES AND CREAMY MUSHROOMS $36\n\nMy cocktail was delicious. \n\nI loved the way that the cheese board was presented which included a printed list including the farm and location from which each option came. All but one of the cheeses were local.\n\nThe chicken was perfect. Crispy outside and a juicy interior which is a lot harder than it sounds to perfect.\n\nThe grits were amazing. These were the creamiest and most succulent grits that I've ever had and that includes a self designed and guided grits tour of Charleston, SC's finest grit offerings.\n\nThe short rib was rich, above average, but the least impressive item of the night.\n\nThe atmosphere was bumpin and the server rocked."

They cooked it with black eyed peas which was interesting. The lobster spaghetti was ok but I could not eat much of it so the portion size was perfect. The sauce is a very rich creamy sauce so you would not be able to handle too much of it. An additional star is added for the decor and service. My waitress was excellent, and the manager stopped by my table a few times to ask if I was doing ok and if I needed anything. The decor and service will have me going  back a second time to try out other menu items. Overall good dining experience and I will be back again!"

The perfect atmosphere for a date night.\n\nFor cocktails I got the fig and the lemon as well as the perfect pear. I enjoyed both. My boyfriend got the love sazerac, I'm your huckleberry and a very good bourbon drink. The love sazerac was his favorite of the 3 and hes going to try and recreate it at home. It's made with vieux carre absinthe which they only make at the Philadelphia Distillery so it was a nice surprise to see that they had it on their menu! \n\nWhen our reservation time finally came around, the hostess grabbed us from upstairs and showed us our table. It was a lot noisier and crowded downstairs, but it was expected considering it was the day after valentines day and also a late Friday night.\n\nWe started off with the steak tartare and their special for the night which was the fettuccine caviar. Both were great, but my boyfriend and I really loved the steak tartare. It was served with chips, horseradish, shallots and eggs. So good! For entrees, I got the braised veal fazzoletti and my boyfriend got the love bird. Both were fantastic! \n\nMy boyfriend and I try not to repeat restaurants unless we REALLY like them. The Love has definitely made it to our list of repeats. Can't wait to come back and try to rest of the menu!"

Wife had the crab ravioli which she loved. She said the pasta was light and perfectly cooked and the carrot flavored sauce added a unique taste that complimented the pasta. We shared the \"pickled things\" side dish which I enjoyed far more than she did. It is quite a lot of food for a side dish and has a very pronounced vinegar flavor. Again, I really enjoyed this but my wife did not care for how acidic it was. I got the prime rib sandwich which comes with a creamy horseradish sauce. It was cooked perfectly and is a substantial sandwich which comes with a side of greens and seasoned chips. I only had a few bites of the sandwich. In the interest of fairness I do not eat red meat often and felt the sandwich was a little heavy for my taste. Chips were seasoned well and cooked properly. I must say their iced tea is exceptional. The wife had a dessert which she enjoyed. I forget exactly what it was but remember it was the last one listed. She said it was light and not overly sweet. All in all excellent service, nice atmosphere and creative dishes compel us to return soon and sample other menu items."

We shared every dish we ordered, and the portions are pretty substantial so this was easy to do while still feeling like you had really tasted each one. We started with the crispy duck salad and the mushroom toast. Frankly, if I had only had these two dishes, I would have left there totally satisfied. The duck was perfectly cooked and there was a generous amount. I think the mushroom toast was my favorite dish of the entire night--rich, savory, and phenomenally delicious. We also had the brisket papardelle and the \"Lovebird\" fried chicken--both divine. The chicken is super moist and meaty, but the sides really steal the show. We were so full I sadly could not even attempt a dessert. Great service, great ambiance, a beautiful place for a leisurely special dinner. We'll be back!!!"

I know music is a silly thing to notice in a restaurant and it's not super loud, just enough for some background noise, but every time a new song came on I was caught thinking, \"oh man I love this artist/song\". It just added to the overall ambiance of the meal.\n\nThe staff was super friendly and decor was really spot on. It's in a great part of town and I had no idea it was located where it was. It's also way bigger than I would have thought.\n\nThe food was really awesome. It was pretty heavy, I couldn't have that every day. However, I appreciated the selection. From fried green tomatoes to barbecue tofu to curry, there is really something for everyone. And each dish had an air of thoughtfulness to it.

The environment would be cozy if the tables weren't so close together.

First I made reservations over a month ago as this was our first trip to Philly and my husbands birthday. \nThe wicker chairs are awful. I thought we would fall through them any minute. Our server was not welcoming at all. Didn't say her name, didn't describe menu just asked if we was ready to order. After she took our order she didn't return for the longest time. Another server brought our first course, another server cleared it, another server remarked us, another server brought our main course. After about 10 mins in to our main course did she appear and do a \"drive by\" check in on us. At the end she showed up to clear and took my drink away too when their was some left in it.  We wanted dessert but decided to go somewhere else and we didn't want to deal with her anymore. When I made the reservation I mentioned it was my husbands bday ( now I didn't expect a song & dance ) but a nice happy birthday would of been nice. It's weird as the place was so busy and as I looked around other tables were having fun so maybe since it was just two of us we weren't good enough. With so many restaurants in Philadelphia I recommend going somewhere else"

We ordered Parker rolls, lobster spaghetti, and duck salad for starters. The Parker rolls were great, soft with nice flavor, we ended up getting 2 orders. The lobster spaghetti had plump, perfectly cooked lobster, with just the right amount of sauce. The duck salad was amazing crispy skin and flavorful meat with the nice vinaigrette in the salad, went well with one another. It was a little clumsy to eat since it was in bone, but didn't mind getting my hands on it. I ordered the scallops which were also cooked perfectly, great size, and paired well with the peaches. My sister ordered the curried rack of ribs, which she liked but thought was weird. But she isn't a foodie person, nor does she try a lot of different flavor dishes, so this was great for her, haha. My mother ordered the Bronzino, her 1st time having this type of fish and she liked how light and flaky it was. We shared the strawberry shortcake sundae and the caramel waffle cone sundae. Both were really yummy but u believe we like the caramel waffle cone sundae the best, the strawberry coulis and the strawberries themselves were too tart for them, I enjoyed it though, it went well with the ice cream.

The entire restaurant has a beautiful, romantic and elegant ambiance and decor. We were greeted at the door by a candlelit bar and the hostess and were immediately seated. I loved the southern style seating with the couches and tables- it was very classy. \n\nOur server was wonderful and considerate of our vegetarian needs. We got two cocktail drinks, which were flavorful and not watered down at all! We got the special soup for the night, which was the Broccoli Cheddar soup. It came out pretty cold, so we had to send it back. When it came back, it was definitely warmer, but it was pretty salty. Nonetheless, we enjoyed the soup. \n\nThen we got Exotic Mushroom Toast -- which sounded amazing, however, once again it was very very salty and extremely oily. The mushrooms were well seasoned and were tasty, but I think the salt and oil was a little too overwhelming. Lastly, we tried the Ricotta Ravioli -- which honestly was an interesting concept with the cauliflower sauce, but it was sub-par, at best. Though it seems like a small addition, the toasted breadcrumbs actually overtook the entire flavor because they were once again, super salty. It seemed as if every dish was increasing saltiness. I do commend the concept of everything and the food at great potential. I've heard nothing but good things about The Love, so I was surprised at the excessive amount of salt in all of our dishes. They gave us complementary mini carrot cakes and it was SO GOOD.... delicious and moist.\n\nOverall, I am willing to give it another try because of the positive reviews and comments."

Tasty and interesting.\n\nStarted with the cheese plate, had a wide range of cheeses and their complements. Good to share for 3-4 ppl.\n\nI thought the ricotta ravioli was the show of the night! It was the perfect ratio of ingredients, not too heavy, not too soft/hard. It was just perfect to start off.

Went so well with the marinated cabbage!\n\nThe fried chicken was nicely soft inside with crispy skin outside, went very well with the two sides of grits and collard greens. The grits was buttery and well blended, just melted in our mouth! Collard greens were a bit too sweet in my opinion..\n\nA WHOLE trout was served! A bit bland for my taste and wished the skin could be more crispy but the rice came along this dish stole the show! So so good!\n\nThe beef in blue cheese was my least favorite.. maybe because I'm not fond of blue cheese.

Both of the entrees were delicious and filling. The side of potatoes was really salty (and I like salty food so that's saying something). I did decide to let our server know about the potatoes so she replaced them with a portion that was less salty. Value is important to me, I'd say that this met the mark since the atmosphere was really nice and the entrees we received were high quality. \n\nOverall, we were really impressed! The food was delicious and the safety measures put in place were appreciated.

It was one of the best fried chickens I've ever had! The sauce was really good and the chicken was cooked perfectly.  The Pappardelle had onion fondue, thyme, burrata, shallots.   It was my least favorite. The beef was enjoyable but I would of rather gone looking back to the lobster pasta dish.  \n\nWe had the Torched Broccoli. It was ok.  The other sides of grits and other vegetable that cake with the meal were better.  The grits really went well with the chicken. \n\nFor dessert we had Caramel Corn Sundae \npeanuts, toffee and buttered popcorn ice cream. It was a good way to top off the experience.  The buttered popcorn ice cream was unique and enjoyable. \n\nGood overall restaurant in center city!"

If the final price of dinner was a bit lower, I think I would have giving the experience a 4... for the overall cost of the meals, I just expect more."

There are two bar areas - one downstairs which is smaller and one that is a bit larger with a lounge area upstairs (take the elevator).  We ate upstairs in the lounge the first time - didn't have reservations, but since the upstairs is not well known it wasn't hard to find a couple of seats.  The second time we ate we had reservations and ate with another couple. \n\nThe atmosphere is excellent and decor well thought-out as are most Starr restaurants.  They have their own specialty cocktails but I ended up ordering a Gimlet which was well made.  The wine is also reasonably priced and the wait staff are good at making pairings if you're interested. \n\nWe tried the salmon poke and duck salad for appetizers which were excellent.  We shared the steak tartare and scallops for a main course.  The tartare was good, but I'd rather have the chicken again.   If it's your first time then the chicken is the way to go.  Also, I hear the pasta is excellent, so I hope try that on my next visit.\n\nThe price is good for Rittenhouse - a bit more reasonable than Parc and Lacroix - but careful with the cocktails because that can get expensive."

Our waitress recommended two wonderful bottles of wine that suited us perfectly with no complaints around the table.\n\nIn terms of food, our waitress described each dish meticulously with details surrounding each dish, and made the right decision during a moment of analysis paralysis. Eventually, I decided on sharing fried chicken and the ribs with a friend. The fried chicken was absolutely phenomenal that was so moist and tender complimented with a delicious aioli. In addition, the ribs had a wonderful outer crispiness, but  more importantly every strand and fiber of the meat just slid right off the bone.\n\nWhile we had a private reservation for a large party, the staff went above and beyond to making us feel at home and every bite of the food was delicious!

Not exactly helpful.  Another time I was sitting in the second floor lounge area close to bar and wanted to order food and it turned into a large ordeal where they didn't want to serve food in the lounge because it wasn't the optimal seating.  They finally let us order the food after 15 minutes of trying to figure out if it was actually a policy or not (apparently not)."

It wasn't bad but it was a bit too much butter so it felt heavy and greasy. We ordered it as an appetizer and split it so it worked but it would've been too heavy as a meal.\n\nFor my entree - I ordered the veal lasagna. This was delicious! Great combination of flavors with the veggies and sauce  - definitely filling. It was two square slices of lasagna - share if you want to try different plates. \n\nCheese grits - I'm such a grits fan and I really like these grits!!!! They were the perfect texture and had a bit of a kick. \n\nDessert - ordered the Cracker Jack sundae. If you like salted caramel - this dessert is for you!  The popcorn is literally Cracker Jack ha. The ice cream itself was delicious. It's a very sweet dessert!"

The food quality was great but nothing above and beyond that would make this 5-stars for the price we paid. Overall, a nice place for a fancy dinner, but given the choice between a restaurant of a similar price and here, I'd probably pick the other restaurant for the extra attention to service, the prompt seating, and the finer details in the food."

Everything was perfectly seasoned. Also loved how you have the option to pay $1 per person for endless sparkling water! I gave it a 4 Star because of the service. Luckily my husband and I weren't in any kind of hurry. I feel like we were stuck in limbo too much.

        "text": "\"The Love\" gave me no love. I left heartbroken about the wasted Saturday night dinner - the restaurant was that bad. The hype was overwhelming and so we had to go, but spare your palate and your wallet and your heart and go someplace else. \n\nOur appetizers were average, at best. We ordered a smoked trout toast and bread rolls. The toast was alright but the taste of garlic and mayo were overpowering the taste of fish. The bread rolls were warm but bland. That's about it. We could tell from the presentation that there was not even a slightest pretense of love when the chef prepared the dish. \n\nWe immediately noticed that the choice of appetizers was underwhelming,and so we had a difficult time finding something that sounded delicious. Probably, it was a sign for us to leave, but we ignored it and stayed, unfortunately. I would imagine that the rest of the appetizers were as bad as what we have ordered today. \n\nThe main dishes were even worse, totally yucky! My husband ordered a fish curry($34!). When we asked the waitress about this dish, she said it was the most flavorful choice on the menu. We didn't realize that she was joking. The sauce was atrocious, and it should be a crime to make a dish that bland! I shudder at the thought of how nauseating that dish was. \n\nI ordered pasta with braised veal. My search for veal uncovered only a handful of veal pieces - some were fatty, some were super over cooked. \n\nBy the end of our underwhelming meal, naturally I started fantasizing about what Chef Ramsay would have said (maybe even screamed and shouted and cried in despair) about the quality of our meal at The Love(*cringing at the mismatch between the name of the restaurant and the quality delivered). \n\nWe usually order desserts, but the dessert menu didn't offer anything that sounded edible. At the end of our experiment ( can't even call it a meal), the waitress brought two tiny squares of cake that actually looked edible, and these were presented pompously as \"compliments of the chef.\" We tried the squares and they were quite good(*gasp). We suggested to the waitress that we would be happy to order the full sized pieces of the squares. Her response was \"I will tell the chef that you enjoyed the squares. Thank you. She would be pleased to hear.\" Honestly, we didn't say it to please anybody and we were not there to please, but to eat and to enjoy ourselves. Her answer should have been \"We apologize for this horrible dessert menu, and we also apologize that the squares were only offered to tease and not as samples of something that you could potentially order. Sorry for teasing you, our dear customer, with something that was finally edible.\" \n\nService: The server was disinterested in how the meal was progressing. Actually, we felt rushed throughout the whole meal. \n\nOverall vibe: Some places have, and some don't. Unsurprisingly, this place lacks that as well."

While they were both tasty, the caesar was the clear favorite in my book, which I would not have expected. The caesar was just a tweak that I had never experienced on a classic restaurant staple. \nThe mushroom soup is delectable. It's summer now, though, so you may not want to order that but if for some reason you're craving it when it's 85 degrees out, I would recommend getting it. \nThe spaghetti with lobster is good, but it was not my favorite of the pasta dishes. The smoked brisket parpadelle was definitely the winner in my book but the truffle gnudi was a close second. These dishes are definitely on the smaller side so if you're feeling hungry, you may want to get more than just that. \nThe bohemian fish curry was good but not my favorite of my first trip to this place (in case you couldn't tell the chicken was my absolute favorite). It was tasty so don't let my bias for fried chicken deter you from ordering it if picks your fancy. \nFor dessert the first time, we had the deconstructed dirt in a cup sundae. Didn't like it very much. However, on my next trip here we had the carrot cake sundae and IT WAS SO GOOD. I highly recommend if you like carrot cake."

My friend and I thought there would be a long wait but there was none at all and we were seated in a cozy corner along the window on the banquette. It was such a cute spot and we got all angles of the restaurant. I love people watching sometimes and seeing the flow of restaurants.. \n\nI have always enjoyed Steven Starr restaurants and heard amazing things about this one so I was definitely excited to be here. The menu was has a wonderful variety of options and so are the drinks. I decided to go with the shrimp and grits and it did not disappoint. The grits were so creamy, the sauce was flavorful and blended well with the grits. The shrimp although it did not look like you got many they were jumbo so there were a perfect amount once I had cut some up into the grits. It was so filling and I would definitely have it again! My friend had the turkey melt with a fried egg on a English muffin. I tried a quarter and I have to say that was one of the best English muffins I have ever tasted! \n\nAlthough it was not the most inexpensive brunch I think for the quality and portion you definitely get your money's worth. I definitely need to come back here to try dinner soon and maybe brunch again to get a few drinks."

I forgot the name of the first drink I had but it was a tequila base with an amazing green pepper syrup flavor. The decor was intimate, rustic with a modern and classy twist. Service was spot on and staff was able to provide solid recommendations. We ordered the cheese board (of course because of the Tallulah's relatedness) and the black kale risotto. The seasonal pastas were more shareable plates. The cheese board had great varieties of local cheeses (even one goat cheese that was in the shape of a mouse). It was great that they had a cheese key, but no cheese knife, womp. The kale risotto was clean, and refreshing with the lemon zest flavor. For mains, the go-to according to the staff was the lovebird and, whoa mamma, it did not disappoint. The bird was succulent and juicy, but the whipped sweet potatoes were like dessert. Add the mustard greens and black eyed peas and that dish was perfecto. Will be back again for more Love(bird)!"

I used this line in my insta/FB post but come on it's such a good line I just had to use it again. \n\nI have heard rumblings about this place bc it's both new and trendy. What really got me off was the description of the cheese plate which allegedly had a goat cheese MOUSE. Holy shit, who am I to pass that shit up? \n\nSnagged a res at 6:15pm on a Friday.  I wish I could say that we schlepped the like 5 blocks away that it was but no, we lyft'ed. We were seated immediately and I was eyeing those bread stick branches that are chillin' on the table but then I remembered I'm doing the whole keto thing now. \n\nFor drink we both pulled the trigger on the one with the tequila in it for obvious reasons. The cheese plate was a given. We decided to take it slow for the rest of the meal but subsequently ordered the miso bbq glazed tofu steak, torched broccoli with hot sauce, and the my LITERALLY already changed the pasta menu so I can't tell you for sure what the ravioli was but they won us over by calling it \"twisted ravioli\". \n\nService was wonderful. Waitress was very attentive and friendly. \n\nCheese plate variety was exceptional. There was literally SEVEN kinds of cheese. Are you kidding me!?!? Some hard, some soft, one looked like a mouse, another was like wrapped in a crepe and had a sweet overtone. This is probably one of the best cheese plates I've had in Philly. There was a bunch of adjuvant stuff like a jam of some sort and probably fruit and bread slices but I don't like to distract from the cheese. \n\nBroccoli was covered in a tasty sauce. Tofu was grilled with a slightly burnt flavor that I wasn't in love with. This was just alright, I didn't feel compelled to finish this shit. \n\nThe ravioli was delicious but unfortunately I don't see it on the menu anymore so I'm not sure how helpful that is. \n\nWhen I made he reservation on open table you know how it asks you the occasion? I put that it was my birthday so they brought out this really sweet plate with happy birthday written in chocolate sauce and some lemon bars that were AMAZING. Very nice touch. \n\nIn summary the love is a trendy place with a good ambiance and some gems on the menu. It's a nice place to go especially for the ambiance and service but I have had better food elsewhere."

But I didn't feel super guilty afterwards because all of the ingredients are fresh and clean! \n\nHeads up: two of my friends got the tofu and really really hated it, so I do not recommend that dish.

At 1pm we snagged an Open Table res for 1:15, walked in and were seated right away. I had the open-faced turkey sandwich. It was really decadent and delicious! I also loved the side salad and the breakfast potatoes were perfectly crispy. My friends liked their dishes as well. The second time we had a reservation for 12:30pm. Upon arrival, we were told there was a bit of a wait and they offered for us to grab upstairs and grab a drink while we waited. That should have been an indicator that the wait was going to be long... We chose to wait by the stand... 20 minutes went by before we were finally seated. \n\nOur server apologized and offered to cover our appetizers. We ordered the cheese ball and mini biscuits and they brought out the hush puppies as well. The spicy butter with the hush puppies was phenomenal - order it! This time I went with the brown egg omelet. It was delicious as well. Unfortunately, when we got the check we were charged for all 3 appetizers. It just put us in an awkward situation - we didn't even order one of them, and then we were questioning whether we correctly heard our server. We ended up mentioning it and they took off 2 of the apps. Honestly it wasn't a big deal, but was a little uncomfortable. \n\nLooking forward to coming back for dinner sometime!"

Very comfortable seating (we got couch-like seating in the corner), and very clean!\n\nFood: We got the cheese board, an entree of ribs, and a side of sweet potatoes - definitely enough for 2! The entree's portion sizes were quite large, and we loved the variety. The ribs came with a brussel sprouts cole slaw, and cornbread that paired perfectly with the caramel butter. This cornbread transformed my boyfriend's view of cornbread - he used to think they were hard and crumbly, but this cornbread was very soft and fresh. His highlight was this cornbread! We also loved the cheese board, which covered blue cheese, goat cheese, hard + soft cheeses - all high-quality, really nicely assorted, and plenty of small toast. For birthdays, they carry out a candle on a plate, with 2 raspberry crumbles, and write happy birthday in chocolate - perfect ending to the night. Quick note: we totally thought the thin, long breadsticks were pieces of wood/decoration at first - turns out, they're edible!\n\nService / Wait-Time: Appetizers and entrees were well-timed, and attentive service! \n\nRecommended Must-Try: For me, the cheese board - so visually aesthetic and delicious.

The rent for the space must be outrages because the prices are not set for an average dinner out on the town.  Also, I want to reduce my carbon footprint as much as the next person, but charging for water just strikes me as a bit disagreeable.  A quarter of the menu consists of salads.  I guess if the rest of the menu is too much green, you'll have to settle for one of the many greens. The food is good but for the most part uninventive. The pasta that came with the lobster wasn't home made which is disappointing considering the prices. The short rib needed seasoning. The pierogi and caviar were interesting but the inspiration for the taste seemed to be Mrs T's minis.  The poke salad was fine but I think we've all had our share of salmon crudo with radishes.

I was in total awe of the decor and the perfect lighting for the entire area.\n\nNow seated we are going over the menu and the room. Our server provided detailed answers to each of our questions while being friendly and professional. He really had a nice twist to pouring my beer, firmly holding the base of the glass on a serving tray tilting while filling it, different and entertaining. He also explain the beer I ordered Helles Lager has historical connection with the Von Trapp family of 'The Sound of Music' fame etc. Good beer, brought out the Julie Andrews in me, singing in my head. I really enjoyed my meal of the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with Braised Collard Greens and grits. The chicken was cooked to perfection, the grits were creamy, maybe a little too much of what I believe was heavy cream and the greens slightly too sweet but overall tender with a good flavor. My concern was considering the prices of the entrees we paid for bread, albeit delicious with a great spread it was an additional $5. \n\nRegarding the service I understand the staff was attempting to be efficient and attentive by removing items in an attempt to clean up and to make sure all is well. However I would ask they please be aware of standing over, very close to food on the table. This will help avoid accidental spit or hair landing in the food. Also be mindful when lifting glasses near the mouth this is unsanitary and should be avoided. Maybe consider serving the food on one plate instead of so many separate bowls etc.\n\nOverall I had a very good experience, the food was delicious, our dedicated server was great and the decor is beautiful."

He brought us out a complimentary Tri-Color tomato salad and who doesn't love food that's free, looks amazing, and tastes incredible lol. Rob knocked it out of the park by being so personable ,funny, and great customer service. Recommended the fried chicken dish which I don't usually go for a such an elegant restaurant but it was right on the money! To close it out he surprised us with a congratulations plate and two chocolate cookies for my girlfriend whom we were celebrating her promotion. We're definitely going back thanks guys for the experience!"

The exotic mushroom toast was surprisingly tasty. The spaghetti and lobster was well made, nice creamy flavor but portions are small. The branzino was made well, good smoked flavor to it. The buttermilk chicken was okay- nothing special with the flavor. My friend got the halibut and she thought it was okay. Food was good but it is a bit pricey. \n\nGood service.

Nice to share among 2 people. ($16)\n\nCrispy Brussel Sprouts - was certainly torched but wasn't burnt.  Had a nice strong seasoned flavor and the apple mostardo is nice compliment of softness and coolness to the strong flavor and crispness of the brussel sprouts. Portion size was certainly big. ($8)\n\nSpaghetti and lobster - a creamy rich dish.  The portion size is on the smaller side so it's good to order a small side dish with it.  They don't skimp out the lobster. ($25)\n\nLovebird fried chicken - a staple at the love.  The only thing on the menu that has stayed on their menu since the beginning (2 years ago).  He chicken was certainly thick and juicy.  The sauce that comes with it adds a soft spicy taste to the chicken.  Comes with grit and greens.  ($30)\n\nRating based on food alone.\nHowever I will mention that the service was great.  Cup of water was always filled to the top. Waitress was very professional.  Food was served warm and quickly."

Service was prompt, friendly, and attentive.  I think once they work out a few weak spots on their menu, this place will be great! Right now it's pretty good but there are a few dishes that are not worth the Rittenhouse price point.\n\nFarm Omlette: Fluffy, light, tasty. The best part was the crispy potatoes. This dish was good but not worthy of the price point. It needs something more.\n\nShrimp & Grits: Good but not great. Portions were good, but the sauce needed more flavor and the grits needed something additional to make them truly flavorful (cheese?). Again, this dish needs something more.\n\nBiscuits: Totally different take on them and wonderful! Small, like mini cupcakes. Light, fluffy, buttery, great texture. They came with amazing cayenne maple butter. Definitely the table favorite and very worth the price.\n\nPile of Bacon: This should have been \"just nice\", but the bacon was more plentiful than expected, perfectly cooked, and higher quality than normal (I actually appreciate gourmet bacon, so I feel qualified to make this judgement). A great addition for the price point.\n\nCast Iron Cake: I didn't order this so I didn't get to see the price, but it was very good. Perfect size for a dessert (slightly too much for one person, perfect for sharing)\n\nCocktails: While a tad more expensive than normal, this is where the restaurant really shined by my measure. They were perfectly suited for brunch. We got a Broken Arrow, Strawberry Fields, and a Pink Panther. All were very good, none of them made me regret the high price point.\n\nSummary: I want to go back and try the other entrees to see if there were better ones. What we ordered was a bit disappointing at the price point. The sides, starters, dessert, and drinks were all top notch! I definitely want to come back."

The walls and tables make you feel like you're inside a hidden cavern instead of center city, without feeling stuffy. \n\nFood:\nThe food was good but nothing to write home about. This is the type of place to enjoy multiple courses, as everything except the \"real meals\" are appetizer sized (including the pasta). The dishes, including the cheese plate, were presented beautifully. I enjoyed the all-American cheese board as well as the gnudi pasta. \n\nDrink:\nThe cocktails and mocktails at The Love were creative and light. I enjoyed the wine by the glass as well, especially the very reasonably priced cava brut at $13 a glass. For those looking to avoid alcohol, I would recommend the Completely Reformed made with a saffron soda.\n\nThe beer and cider selection offers lots of local names such as Victory and Yards. Disappointed that there's no draft selection. \n\nService:\nWhile I can only speak for the bar, service was excellent. The bar had 3 bartenders for 8 seats which were friendly and accessible. It was great chatting about the drinks with them and they were happy to offer local beer recommendations. No complaints here. \n\nValue:\nThe final bill at The Love tends to sneak up on you. Because the portions are small, you'll need to order several courses which each come with a more than negligible price tag. Expect to spend $60-$80 a person with alcohol (including a bread basket at an extra fee). This restaurant is not worth it for a full dinner, but a great spot for a drink and appetizers."

My husband ordered the Braised Brisket Fazzoletti ($23) and he found it delicious. \n\nAnd if there is room for dessert, definitely get the Rapture Blondie Sundae (totally forgot to get a picture).

This was great. The lox was very fresh. You kind of constructed your own bagel.. although it was more on a half of flat bread. It had cucumber salad and lettuce lightly dressed which was great. It wasn't as heavy of a meal when you can control how much you put on your flatbread.\n\nMy cousin had the lemon poppy pancakes that she said were very filling.

The veggies were very lightly blanched and the green goddess dip was amazing. Overall, we had an amazing time and enjoyed the food and service.  I do have a small complaint though and it was with the hostess and the restaurant seating \"policy\" for outdoor dining. It was a really nice day outside and we asked to sit outside if possible. They had a whole line of small round tables right on the sidewalk. We were a party of 3 people and supposedly, the restaurant policy does not allow for more than 2 person parties to sit outside. There was not a single customer sitting outside when we arrived or when we left. I asked if they could just put as at 2 tables next to each other. We didn't want to move the tables or anything...we just wanted to enjoy the nice day outside. But nope, they wouldn't budge on their policy and so we ended up sitting inside next to a window (not the same).

Flavor for the cauliflower was great, the dish is so good it doesn't even need the blue cheese crumbles or celery to tie together the concept. The fries were under seasoned but the onion remoulade made up for it because it was so delicious. The fried chicken is their specialty dish and it has been on the menu since opening. It didn't disappoint nor did the grits it was served with. The collard green had a sweet component to them which didn't really work for me. Honey brined pork chop was delicious. I'm not a fan of pork chops and apples but it worked for this dish. The apple marzipan tea cake was so disappointing. Our server, Ricky, who was great and super informative  did recommend getting either the brownie or bee sweet sundae. I should've listened. The complimentary mini dessert he gave us was better than the apple tea cake. All in all The Love is one of those restaurants you always want to try to say you've been. Talula Garden & Parc aside, Stephen Starr restaurants never live up to the hype for me. It is good and worth a try, I might go back and try their brunch."

The atmosphere is unlike a lot of his restaurants in the best way possible. It is beautiful inside, but not in the usual \" quirky/new-age, appeal to millenials\" type, more refined. The old Serafina was nothing to write home about, and that's putting it nicely. But this is a much needed addition to the neighborhood, on that makes it feel like Rittenhouse again. The food and the interior alone are reason enough to get there. Try the cheese board and the dessert board ( blanking on the name). Each portion on the board is tiny but decadent. Although it isn't for an every day meal, it is a treat for special occasions or a nice night out."

The front door staff and wait  staff are very well trained and professional without being stuffy. We didn't have reservations but were warmly welcomed. Sometimes without reservations you feel as though you owe them. The food was very good but it just didn't blow me away. Had the chips and fondue. Some chips were not crispy. The pickled vegetables were very good but some were way better then others. Like the celery was great the carrots not so much. The kale risotto was terrific and my friend had the Kale shrimp salad. I didn't love the salad but the shrimp were impressive. I want to love this. But I'm just majorly \"in like\""

The Lemon and the fig is good if you like lemon drop martinis. Similar but with an interesting twist. The cure has a pretty strong grapefruit flavor which I enjoyed. The food was pretty good. Started with the CBCC. Cookie butter coffee cake. Pairs nicely with a coffee. Not too sweet. Presentation was really cute. They burned a heart into the burger bun which was a cute touch. The posh brunch was good. Pretty average for brunch plates in philly. The eggs and salad could have used a little more seasoning but the potatoes were well seasoned. I'll definitely be back.

It's a smaller venue and being that the temperatures were arctic, it was crowded. The hostess advised there was a wait time even though we had a reservation (Friday night probs) and escorted us up to the upper floor via elevator.  Upstairs there is a cocktail bar (8 stools), cocktail app menu (full dinner available downstairs only) and a few lounge chairs. We scored some seats and ordered drinks. There is a semi-private room upstairs separating cocktail lounge with paned glass french doors that has a large table for parties, business meeting, etc. \n\nI started with the Almost Famous vodka and champagne cocktail. Sweeter than I normally drink, but bubbly good. My husband ordered the MacCallan 12 (they have some nice scotch) it took the chill off for sure.\n\nWe went downstairs after 15 min or so and sat at the larger downstairs bar for another cocktail and were seated by the time we ordered 3rd round. The ambience on a busy Friday night was not intimate, but resonated that joined hum of excitement that only new hip places can emit.\n\nWe started with the Farmers Market Salad and the Pumpkin Curry Soup. We do that annoying switch thing that long time couples do, but I'll risk looking lame for some curry soup any day. Both were amazing...scratch that...insanely good. I would go back, park at the bar, and eat both for lunch or light dinner.\n\nFor entrees we had the Crispy Salmon and the Short Rib Stroganoff. The salmon was cooked perfectly served with crunchy red beets and creme fraiche. A light but satisfying dish as opposed to the belly warming short rib stroganoff that my husband loved.\n\nWe topped it all off with cappuccinos as the love fest ended. You are going to wait...this is not a rushed meal so don't plan on seeing a show afterwards. The service is great, but slow, not uncommon for newer popular restaurants. That being said the food is worth the wait. We bundled and trekked back into frozen tundra with the warm and lovies."

The takeout was superb and I was able to have my order brought outside for me. When my husband and I opened our package we were so pleased for the packaging.  The sauces, sides, accompaniments were all packaged separately.  Since we knew each dish, we were able to plate and sauce each item as it would have been in the restaurant.  We thoroughly enjoyed the mushroom toasts.  Then we proceeded to devour the duck confit salad with ginger vinaigrette.  Our fried green tomatoes got a little recrisping in the oven and were great.  We ended with the fried chicken and a Panna Cotta for dessert.  Even that had the sauce and berries packed separately.  This was almost as good as being there - almost only.  We so missed the ambience of the restaurant, the quality staff, the focus on plating detail.  The food was great, but we so miss being there in person.  But we thank you, staff at The Love, for bringing back the tastes we so have come to love."

While none of the dishes I ordered at this establishment stood out as particularly bad, I believe that a Philadelphia resident can eat food of similar style at other restaurants in the city which are superior in both their menu selection and quality. \nTo start, The Love's cheese plate, Labor of Love, certainly does not lack in portion size. While the selected cheeses pleased the palate, the bread was unimpressive and could do with some varying. Moreover, one should not order this dish in a party fewer than 3 people, as my dining comrade and I were unable to finish the cheese board, leaving me wondering whether it was wise to spend $24 on semi-uneaten dairy.\nLet us move on to the Southern Style Hush Puppies: nothing impressive here. Of course, it would take an astounding lack of intelligence to screw up a deep-fried cornmeal, so I cannot say that this dish tasted \"bad,\" per se, but I could have done without it.\nThe Ruby Beet Risotto: likely my favorite dish from the night, and I would recommend ordering this starter if you choose to dine at The Love. The pomegranate was an excellent touch and a topping of crispy kale complemented the risotto in a delightful manner. Don't expect to taste beet in this dish though (although its name led me to naively expect otherwise). \nAs for the Pulled Brisket Fazzoletti: failed to disappoint, yet also failed to blow my mind in any way. While the brisket was cooked well and pulled apart beautifully, the broccoli in this dish appeared as a sad afterthought, lacking any purpose, like a side salad that always shows up at pizza parties and remains neglected in the corner of a basement. I likely would have done better ordering the famous Love fried chicken. Who knows.\n\nIn terms of outdoor seating in the winter: The Love exceeded expectations. I was seated in an enclosed and heated \"love shack,\" which offered my dining companion and myself with a quiet, warm environment. \n\nWill I be returning to The Love soon? Likely not. But let us be honest with ourselves. As much as Katherine Heigl bores us, we always end up re-watching 27 Dresses on some lonely Friday night. In a similar vein, I could see myself dining once more at this restaurant."

We ordered the duck salable to start, my girlfriend ordered the curry fish, and I had the scallops. The duck salad was so tasty! The fruits tasted fresh, the duck was crispy, but I wouldn't mind if they put the dressing in the side, it was a bit much. Our main courses were so tasty! I tasted the sauce that the scallops sat on and a smile came to my face, I was in love with this sauce. My girlfriend's curry fish sauce was amazingly good too! The scallops were cooked perfectly, not too much not too little.

Yup...you heard correctly. We typically don't drop $25 on an app nor would we think to order what sounds to be an entree as an app. However our waiter convinced us that this was the best thing on the menu. Oh my goodness...heaven on a plate is all I can say about this dish. It's not as heavy as we thought, perfect to share, and just exploding with amazing flavors. Well worth the $25!!\n\nFor entrees we went with the fried chicken, which seems to be one of their signature dishes; and the brisket fazzoleti. I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken or the sides (grits and collards). It wasn't what I'm used to when it comes to those southern classics. Just wasn't my thing. The brisket pasta was to die for. Nice Smokey brisket, in a light cream sauce, with fresh cooked pasta. Doesn't get better than that. \n\nSuch a memorable experience, which in my opinion is what dining is all about.

If I had any quips, it would be that the rest of the food started coming out very quickly after the cheese. \n\nOur caesar salad and lobster spaghetti came out together. My boyfriend wanted to try the spaghetti while it was hot, though I wasn't even done with the cheeses yet. When I did try them, I loved every bite. The caesar salad is lightly dressed with just a little sweetness from the figs. Such a balanced and delicious twist to a classic! The spaghetti was rich and delicately simple. My boyfriend was not a real fan, but these types of pastas are my favorite. \n\nLooking at the menu and photos before I came, I also knew I wanted the lovebird. You can really taste the quality of the meat. It's so tender and JUICY. The grits were some of the best I've had in the city. They're so creamy and rich. The collards weren't my favorite because of the sweet miso sauce, but they were cooked nicely. \n\nWe had toyed with the idea of ordering our own entrees, but luckily we didn't. We were so stuffed from this meal that we had to skip dessert. Our server was so sweet and said he couldn't let us leave without something since it was both of our birthdays. He brought us each a small square of carrot cake that was absolutely delicious. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfectly cream-cheesy and not too sweet. It was such a great way to end our meal at The Love."

Once we were seated, our server came and offered us water and introduced us to tonight's special and offered us his recommendations, which was super helpful for someone as indecisive as me. My spaghetti and lobster was excellent--though, I do wish the portion was slightly bigger. My date was really impressive with his steak. We ended the meal with the chocolate mousse bar for dessert.  Truly a great evening at The Love and will be returning!"

Super attentive and helpful. \n\nWe had the poke which we've had before, it was just as good the second time around. \n\nThe lobster spaghetti was actually one of the best things I've had in 738274 years. I'd go for six orders of this alone. \n\nThe ricotta ravioli were a 3/5. Flavors were really good, but they came out room temp even after sending them back for being room temp. Maybe they can't make them extremely hot for some reason? Wouldn't order again. \n\nScallops and fried chicken were both ooookay. I'd order the fried chicken again over the scallops, if I had to. Nothing too spectacular about either. \n\nThe s'mores Madelines also left a bit to be desired- dry and no real graham cracker flavor. There wasn't enough marshmallow smeared across the plate to really call it a s'mores and the chocolate dipping sauce, while really good in flavor, was too thin for dipping the Madelines into... wouldn't order again. \n\nWe also had the blondie sundae which was really good. I'm not much of a sundae person at nice restaurants but the blonde itself was awesome!\n\nThe Love's ambiance and service is totally on point. Get the lobster spaghetti and sit with Christine! Best service I've had in Philly and NYC in a while! The hostess even sat us far before our reservation."

I had heard about a delectable cheese plate, and I, a self proclaimed cheese plate connoisseur, had to try it. \n\nWe arrived on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was about half full, we had reservations and we're seated immediately. We ordered a couple drinks (which were good, both were nothing special) and promptly ordered the cheese plate. \n\nIt did not disappoint. \n\nAbout 8 cheeses from various regions were plated along with pairings ranging from fruit and nuts to jams. I have to say, generally the problem with cheese plates is that the pairs are subpar, but that was not the case. Each cheese blended well with the accompaniments and they were certainly delicious all on thier own. Additionally, the cheeses were all plated at or close to room temp. This is also something most restaurants miss and it's a shame really, but The Love nailed it with thier cheese plate. We ate it in its entirety and it was perfect. \n\nNow onto the other items. I ordered the fried chicken and my fiance ordered the ribs. My fiance really enjoyed the ribs however my chicken was actually a little dry. (Hence the 4 stars). Finally our dessert was a chocolate mousse that was underwhelming but still good. \n\nOverall I would definitely recommend you try this place  if for the cheese plate alone, it would certainly be worth it"

I felt like any moment the chair will give way and I'll fall onto the floor. Each time the waiters/waitress walked by, my seat shook.

        "text": "Hmmm. Not really a fan. Seemed like it could have been so great, but oddly flavored dishes and slow service really pulled the experience down. The Love was recommended by a colleague, and we felt fortunate to get a table with short notice. However, right from the start the service seemed slow, seemingly from too many tables for the waitress/staff. Our waitress was super friendly, knowledgeable, and professional - just too much to do and less than frequent visits to our table. Plus, by the end of our meal we just wanted to go, and we had to wait to flag down the waitress to get our check and get going. \n\nI had the Lovebird. The fried chicken. I asked if it was good. I was assured it was. It was not. First thing - and I should have noticed this on the menu but did not - is that you don't put sauce with fried chicken. The menu lists \"Jamaican Jerk Aioli\" after Buttery Georgia Grits (which are not), and not directly with the Buttermilk Fried Chicken, and I did not look at other Yelp reviews as I should have. So...I didn't really see the sauce for the fried chicken. Here's a fried chicken tip: if you need sauce, then number one it's not really fried chicken, and number two it's probably not any good. Fried chicken should stand on its own. This didn't. Neither the breast piece (oddly without bones - it was confusing. Not a boneless breast chicken piece, but not with the normal complement of bones), not the thigh piece. Not enough flavor, but please don't include Jamaican Jerk Aioli under my fried chicken. On to the Buttery Georgia Grits - I am not from Georgia, but I cannot imagine any Georgian with standing would vouch for this dish. Tiny slivers of jalape\u00f1o on top do not mask poorly cooked, flavorless gelatin pieces that you pass off as grits. The collard greens had some kind of sweet sauce they were bathed in. Disgusting. I've never in my life had greens that had any sweet flavor, and no one wants it. The greens were cooked well, but the sweet taste ruined it. \n\nWe got the check (when we could) and got out. Again, it seemed like it had so much potential and was recommended. Maybe it was just this meal, but ours was just a three star."

They not only seated us quickly but even met our request to be in the sun. The tables were at a good distance, staff wore appropriate PPE, and I felt comfortable (and safe) dining here from a COVID standpoint. The heaters between each table were definitely a plus and kept me warm. My husband and I shared the savory hush puppies, posh brunch with italian truffle eggs, and ricotta ravioli with pumpkin and parmesan sauce. Everything was seasoned perfectly and very flavorful.

Came here with work colleagues while on travel at one of their cousin's recommendation. \n\nFor appetizers, we got this cheese plate that was pretty well laid out and tasty. We also got these breads that you could spread what tasted like maybe toasted green onion butter spread. For some of us Asians, this may bring some nostalgia of scallion baked goods. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the lobster spaghetti and was definitely not disappointed. There was a solid amount of lobster with that ideal creamy bisque taste and texture. I also asked for a side of parmesan cheese and they were not stingy. I usually like to taste the dish on its own then proceed to create a blizzard of cheese. This is probably causing chagrin from the professional Italian food eaters but I love my cheese so thank you to the servers for not being stingy or judging! My coworkers got some fish and I forget what else but they were both in heaven. We also got brussel sprouts to share and those were good. My colleagues also loved these immensely. It didn't quite top my favorite version though it was enjoyable for me. \n\nIt was also a  colleague's birthday and I was able to communicate this with the server and she took care of the surprise. They gave us some cookies that were delicious. Perfectly crunchy on the outside but soft and hot inside. We also ordered the peanut butter crunch dessert and it was delicious even for someone like me who does not love chocolate. \n\nFood was great! I would say 4.5 stars and service was really great.

Not too fast, not too slow. \n\nMy friend and I decided to share the Braised Brisket Fazzoletti and the Santa Fe Salmon.

But the real star was the pasta dish.  I could have that every day! \n\nFor dessert, we shared the Warm Gingerbread Madeleines, which cane with caramel, orange whipped cream and cranberry relish. I'm not a big dessert person, so this was great because it was not too sweet and was well balanced with the tartness of the cranberries and the spice of the gingerbread. \n\nFrom the service to the creative food to the ambience, The Love is well worth a visit."

We had the seared scallops with stir fried market vegetables and a soy beurre blanc, which was delicious and not overly rich. The vegetables had Asian flavors, perhaps a five-spice powder, and were delicious. There were 4 scallops that were on the small side and since the vegetables were plentiful we certainly didn't go hungry but at $33 the price felt steep for what we got.  We also had the hot and sour halibut that was served in a broth with baby bok choy, turnips and thai basil. The broth was delicious and our favorite part of the dish since the halibut, while tasty, was overcooked. We shared a dessert, a vanilla pudding with orange flavor served with hazelnuts and poached figs, as well as cubes of butter cake served on the side for my husband since I'm gluten intolerant. The only other gluten free option was a sorbet but it was not an appealing choice on a cold night.\nAt the price point for this restaurant it would have been very nice to have a gluten free bread option. There are good ones out there, including from Taffets gf bakery that would be  up to their standards.\nOne major plus of the meal was that the service was excellent, friendly, and unobtrusive, which we appreciated.\nWith all of the options in Philly, we're not thinking of returning to The Love anytime soon, as we are to Talula's garden owned by the same team."

It was apparent that the waiter was just trying to push the most expensive things on the menu on us for no other reason than they were expensive. This is so obvious to customers and really unhelpful. He didn't give us any honest recommendations about the dishes he just told us to order one appetizer, pasta and entree a person. If we had done that it would have been entirely too much food. We ended up sharing two appetizers and each getting a pasta. We ordered three rounds of drinks and by that point our waiter seemed to have changed his mind about us because he saw that we were spending money.

This new spot has all the ingredients for a match made in heaven. \n\nAlthough it only opened in the Winter of 2018, I felt like eons had passed before my first visit in the middle of May 2018. Trust me, it had been number one on my list of places to try for a while. \n\nSo, my first visit was during lunch hours. I'm already jonsing to go back for dinner and explore that cocktail menu. In the meantime, it was love at first bite with everything I tried. \n\nOur group started with the crudit\u00e9s and goddess dip for the table. I'm not really sure what was in the goddess dip, but it was green, creamy and had a pesto-like resemblance. Eaten in the privacy of my own home, there would have been plate licking going on. The veggies were a mix of radishes, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, asparagus and beans. Veggie plates are usually boring; however, these were honestly the most fresh, crisp veggies I've had in my lifetime. \n\nDebating between the ricotta ravioli with lump crab, carrot sauce, basil and fennel pollen and the Tuscan black kale risotto with meyer lemon, pecorino and crispy brussels, the server suggested the risotto as being the stronger of the dishes. Both dishes were ultimately ordered, but I would conquer that the risotto had that something special to it. \n\nDon't skimp on the extras; our table split the chips and fondue, cucumber and feta salad and the cheese ball with lavender, pistachio, fig-honey and crips. At least for lunch, there isn't a true appetizers menu, but these sides can fill that void.\n\nAlthough stuffed, we decided we had to try one dessert and went with the cast iron cake with rhubarb batter and ginger-honey ice cream. It came out piping hot in the cast iron but had refreshing qualities because of the ginger ice cream and fresh ingredients.\n\nWith any restaurant that you put on a pedestal before visiting, there's a chance for disappointment. The Love blew my expectations out of the water, and have left me already eager for a return visit. It's not just infatuation, it's love."

Dana, my server was as attentive and helpful as she could be and we were able to chat for a bit. We talked about the mission and vision of The Love and it soon became apparent that the restaurant's name suggested that one could \"taste the love\" from the kitchen, especially given the homey presence of Soul Food delights like Love Bird Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Ginger-Miso Collards, Hush-puppies, Stone Ground Grits and Bee Sweet Sundae. \n\nChef Olexy was able to stop by my table and it was wonderful to congratulate her on both venues. She obviously sets the tone for her staff by being so open, genial, creative with her profiles, service-minded, focused and genuinely kind. I also found that chef Charles was on site as well and, for me, the result was memorable.\n\nThe tomato salad was bright, balanced and completely refreshing.  The Tuna Crudo is on the menu here as well at TG, and like it, this salad had a lot going on; but none of it was too much.  Although it was about to storm outside, the salad brought sunshine to my table. Delicious.\n\nThe hush puppies were a \"howdy there!\" delight! -deftly fried, light as a cloud, mildly spiced with what seemed like a pinch of nutmeg, and only slightly naughty with their whisper of aleppo pepper. The salted honey butter brought just the right righteous touch.  Now behave!\n\nThe salmon, took its inspiration from the \"everything\" seasoning of a bagel and it was beautifully balanced. Again, there was a lot going on and all of it was relevant. There was nothing superfluous here, nothing you'd say \"oh, they could have left that off...\" Not at all. Every element contributed to the success of the dish.  Delicious!  The real plus for me was the carrot hummus that gave a whipped vegetable texture, and the almost latke-like potato crisps inserted into the pur\u00e9e.  Another success was to serve the fish with the beautiful salmon pink flesh side up. I'm not brought into a fish dish by seeing the skin on top.  It's the salmon flesh that draws me in, so that's what sets my juices flowing to eat it.  I only have two suggestions. First, I'd have preferred that my requested \"medium\" temp would have resulted in the fish at least warm throughout. The center was just too completely raw for me.  To be honest, if it were Tuna I'd have been fine. But Salmon and Tuna don't equally benefit from a raw center.  Sushi? Sure.  But that's a whole different experience.  Second, I'd have appreciated carving away the muddy-looking blood line meat in advance especially since the skin was removed.  Just a small recommendation for a bit more refined knife work.\n\nThe German Ros\u00e9 was sheer bliss and perfect with the salmon. And my litmus-test opening cocktail of a Manhattan was perfectly mixed.\n\nThe Dessert was utterly scrumptious. Sweet Chef Rachel Connelly is doing a fine job here! The presence of this balsamic strawberry and short-bread crumble for a modified panna cotta was just the right touch to end the meal. (And the espresso was excellent as well.)\n\nWith my meal tallying $104., I found that I was served delicious food, creatively conceived, true to its mission, and well worth the cost, even if only for the food alone. But what made this meal worth my while as well as worth the money was the truly upbeat and caring service.  Can you imagine any form of a soul-food place with no soul? How oxymoronic and even off-putting would that be? Upscale or down-home, a place serving grits and collards can't fake or flub being glad that people came to eat a meal. That's a recipe for success that The Love has mastered without any fakery or hypocrisy.  Everyone there is excited about what they're doing. The \"love,\" in the best sense, isn't just in the hush-puppies or painted on the door, it's in the terrific people who serve such yummy food there.  \"It's a \"must return\" place for me. I'm looking forward to the pork chop with peaches!\nMy very high recommendation."

For example, their Southern Style Hush Puppies were perfectly crispy fritters made from a cornmeal batter, dusted with Aleppo pepper and served with a salted honey butter for dipping. The Lemon Risotto was a summery rice dish made with yellow squash, zucchini, basil gremolata, and mascarpone cheese, all topped with crispy squash blossoms. For appetizers, the portion sizes of both of these dishes were extremely generous, and the flavors were simply spot on!\n\nAnd then came our mains. The Seafood Cioppino was a seafood stew made with shrimp, mussels, and diced squash in a tomato-lemon-garlic broth, topped with a crispy, flakey fillet of branzino and a long slice of ciabatta bread. The Honey Brined Pork Chop was a juicy, succulent pork chop served with a savory ginger-scented glaze, along with roasted peaches for a touch of sweetness. But my favorite dish was the restaurant's signature \"Lovebird,\" a fried chicken breast and deboned chicken thigh, served with a creamy, spicy Comeback sauce, along with sides of buttery grits and slow-cooked collard greens flavored with ginger-miso. The buttermilk fried chicken had a perfectly crispy crust and juicy interior; the Comeback sauce had just the right amount of spice; and the sweet, umami ginger-miso collard greens were so unique in flavor.

This review will focus on the service, but a quick note on 2 things: (1) the food was very average, except for the exotic mushroom toast, which was excellent, and (2) the chairs were uncomfortable, and extremely rickety - we all felt like our chair could collapse at any moment. \n\nServer approached our table after several minutes. To say her intro was like warm would be a favor. Demanded that we place our entire order immediately, and was almost inflexible at the notion we might want to decide as we dined (worth noting we had a late reservation, so the table was not going to be turned for another diner). She created an immediate sense of hostility, leaving the four of us to wonder where we could find a table elsewhere on short notice. The service went downhill from there. Nominal, essentially mandatory stop at our table once to \"check on us.\" Our plates were removed as the last bite went down, and then she began to clean the table - not as a courtesy, but at what appeared to be her side work. The final straw was our server looking at the credit card slip, seeing her hundred dollar tip, and grabbing the slip from my hand. Have dined in many Steven Starr restaurants over the years, and always enjoyed the experience. Bottom line - we had a $400+ tab, but poor service will lead us not to return."

It seemed as though the service provided is only as good as the amount of money they think you are willing to spend. Being neglected versus the other tables alone wouldn't warrant a review. When we asked for another round of drinks, our server  Shannyn said \"um.....yeah\" while walking away from our table, then brought our drinks with the check in hand. All around awkward experience, especially since my friend and I both worked for Steven Starr restaurants. Shannyn, we would have easily left way over 20% because we know what it's like to take up a table but now I have no interest in returning"

Decor is nice but it took forever for someone to come and take our order even though we got our drinks. It was more than 15 mins of waiting and there are so many people working there. Makes no sense. Food came pretty quick. Portion size is humongous. They are not kidding about putting you back to bed. I got the fried flounder which was tasty but I can use less food. Turkey melt had odd pieces of vegetables and pickles which made the dish not cohesive. Shame because the actual turkey part was tasty. Potatoes could be better. Coffee refills had to be asked for and was slow. I did appreciate the water with ice. There are probably better brunch elsewhere."

Bottom line: both times were perfectly lovely and I'd come again. \n\nI made reservations for 2 the day before and I was seated outside per my request as soon as I arrived (well, after they took my temperature in the wrist. I didn't have to wait for my friend to arrive). In the beginning my waiter forgot that I had already given him my drink order (love drunk/their mule) but after that things went pretty smoothly. \n\nI ordered the scones which were warm and lovely but nothing special. I was between the chicken and waffles and the pancakes (I was avoiding the straight up egg dishes) and eventually decided on the lemon poppy pancakes with sour cherry sauce. Whew, that sauce was overpowering, it's very rare you can barely taste the lemon in a lemon dish but this was one of those times. The pancakes themselves were fluffy and had a great consistency so I enjoyed them despite. Very filling.  My friend loved her chicken and waffles. \n\nAs for the drinks, while drinking my mule I thought to myself \"this is very refreshing...im barely tasting any alcohol though.... not enough ginger..\" But there was definitely alcohol in that bad boy, don't let them fool you. \n\nIn general, is come back for the chill vibe sitting outside (who doesn't love people watching) and the intriguing cocktail menu (there was even a drink named after Kamala ;)"

The breading was flavorful, the dish comes with a pimento cheese and bread and butter pickles- all eaten together, is such a beautiful blend of flavors and textures - you have to try it, best fried Green Tomatoes I've had outside of Charleston, Sc\n\nThe lobster spaghetti: not very what I'd hoped. I think the initial disinterest came from it not being served hot it was barely warm and the flavor was lacking. I anticipated it to be packed with Rich buttery flavor as the lobster bisque is the sauce, but it wasn't. In addition, the bits of lobster didn't add anything to the dish as whole. I was most excited about this dish upon ordering but it fell flat.\n\nThe Salmon: Again we have the issue with the temperature of this dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly about a medium to medium well and it was atop of a broth with mixed Asian vegetables. The flavor for the broth as well as the Salmon wasnt exciting. Seeing on the menu how the Salmon was described as Vietnamese and caramel- I anticipated something a little more in line with the rich flavors of a traditional Carmalized Vietnamese Salmon bUt this fell flat.\n\nThe crab cakes: Delicious! The crab cake had the perfect char and the snow peas were tender and a great texture to compliment the crab cake- as well as the dish being beautifully plated- this dish was amazing!\n\nService: fantastic! Polite, attentive - I noticed a table next to us drop a utinsel and the hostess was there to pick it up and offer another in the next 5 seconds.\n\nOverall, the food was good, the service was excellent and I would go again, but perhaps it wouldn't be my first choice in an area with an array of options."

Tables are much farther than 6 feet, Staff stays 6 feet away when ordering, and they constantly change gloves. I felt extremely comfortable, keep it up! On to the food.\n\nWe started with the Parker house rolls and the famed Corn Truffle Risotto and the Love drunk cocktail. The Parker house rolls were warm, light, nice outer crust, and the chive butter was out of this world! Please give me a tub of that. The risotto was beautifully presented and pretty tasty, but the risotto was a little underdone. Let's be clear, the Love Drunk will not make anyone drunk, I barely tasted any alcohol.\n\nFor our entrees we had the the Lovebird and the Salmon Situation. The Lovebird is their fried chicken dish with a side of greens and grits. The chicken was moist, crunchy, and had great flavors. The grits were delicious! And the greens weren't half bad, a tad too sweet. The Salmon curry dish was another pretty dish, but the curry was more of a mustard sauce and not warm unfortunately. The salmon was cooked perfectly and the cauliflower added a nice crunch. \n\nWe finished with the chocolate mousse bar with the amaretto icecream. It was laughably small, but packed a nice flavor. Overall\n\nParker house rolls 5/5\nCorn and Truffle risotto 4/5\nLove bird 5/5\nSalmon Situation 3/5\nChocolate Mousse Bar 4/5\nCocktail 2/5"

When we asked for some hot water to heat up a bottle, it was HOT and in a metal bin with plenty of room. It was so nice to be able to feel like adults having a nice brunch on a Saturday morning with our baby. Not once during our meal did the staff or other diners behave or speak in a way that made us feel as though our having a baby in the restaurant was a nuisance.

There is also a legend for you to learn about the cheeses and its origins - you'll see a cute one in a mouse shape. The steak tartare was great: comes with housemade crisp potato chips and a mashed boiled egg, pickled onions.

I had the steak and he had the fried chicken, both were cooked perfectly with lots of flavor. 10/10 will go back next time we are in philly."

I went for brunch and got the turkey melt, my mom got an omelette. My meal was okay, but just kind of bland and covered in too much cheese. The menu is decent but in my opinion this place was overpriced compared to other similar places in the area. I was surprised that everything was $15-20 for pretty simple brunch dishes. Overall I think my expectations were too high because of the hype surrounding this place...it was not anything special. The interior is really cute, though."

The cheese plate was fabulous, NOT ONE of the 8 we didn't like, and the bleu was particularly FABULOUS, also LOVED the cheese molded into the shape of a mouse, nice li'l flourish.  The corn soup was sooo different, SOOOO GOOD, didn't want it to end.\n\nFor our entrees we had the Brisket  Pappardelle, (wonderfully tender & sooo good), and the Ricotta Ravioli (Positively Delish).  Next time we'll have to try the \"Lovebird\".\n\nFinally, we ended our WONDERFUL, SCRUMPTIOUS meal with \"Not Your Neighbor's Cookie Plate\" and a couple of lattes and we were set for the night, as we went on our way with every intention of returning in the near future."

The waitress warned me that the lobster spaghetti was a smaller portion, but I was still stuffed. My favorite was the dessert! I forgot the exact name but it was some type of sundae with crackerjacks. Don't leave here without trying it!\n\nThe only reasons I'm giving it 4 stars is because 1) the wicker chairs were not comfortable and felt a little shaky 2) it was so loud!

Our table was right by the door and was drafty. We were disappointed because we were looking forward to experiencing the inside of the restaurant, not greeting guests as they walked in :/ (I realize we could have asked for a different table but it was so busy it didn't look like there was one and the staff seemed to have an air of authority that I inherently respected for some reason). \n\nStarving, we told our friendly waiter we would like to start with the Parker House Rolls and were immediately told, in an attempt of politeness that they prefer us to order the whole meal at once so the staff can prepare how things come out. This sounded fancy and attentive, but also off putting. A few minutes later we ordered the rolls, fried green tomatoes, crispy Brussels sprouts, the short rib pasta, and the fried chicken. \n\nFood was delicious and well plated. The Brussels sprouts were an amazing crispy gone soggy texture with great flavor- and I don't even like Brussels sprouts! Fried green tomatoes were lovely and the rolls are a must order. Entrees were rich with flavor and very filling which meant left overs :)! Not sure why we had to order everything at once because it all came out in a usual order. \n\nWaiter was nice enough but not attentive! Especially after talking us down when we first started ordering; figured he was going to be extra professional for the rest of the meal. Some hostess/food runner girl who noticed us sitting and waiting was the one who refilled our waters and ran our credit card because our waiter was setting other tables for the next guests; really? Was it because we were in the crummy corner table? \n\nOverall, a good experience that was compounded by strange service. I would return and it would be fun with a medium sized group."

        "text": "I have to admit.. I didn't love The Love. I liked it just fine, but would I come back and drop another 200 dollars on an \"okay\" meal? Unlikely.\n\nI dined here mid-week and had a 7:45 reservation with one other dining partner. Upon arrival, we were told that our table was just about ready so we could wait at the bar. The bar area was extremely crowded and there was really nowhere to stand without being in the way of servers streaming in and out with dishes and drinks. We attempted to get a menu and order a drink, but it was just too crowded and not one bartender looked up to notice that we were interested in ordering. We waited 20 minutes for our table, which was pretty annoying since it was already a late reservation.\n\nThe restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a buzzing, warm atmosphere. The table we were seated in had seats almost next to each other, facing into the restaurant. Totally agree with some of the other reviews that this kind of seating works on Rittenhouse Square to people watch, but not in the interior of a restaurant. I don't need to sit directly next to my dining companion and I would much rather prefer to sit across from them. \n\nWe started with water ($1 dollar/glass for their filtered water) and each got a glass of champagne. Their drink menu is comprehensive, but I didn't find a cocktail that really peaked my interest. The champagne was good, no complaints. I also tried one of their ciders, which was a little sweet for me but was fine. \n\nFor food, we started with the rolls, the pumpkin soup, and the gnudi pasta course. The rolls were just mediocre rolls of bread that were dry inside with an overly chived butter that didn't even melt upon spreading it. The soup was good and had a nice curry flavor, but could have been hotter. It was served lukewarm. I thought the gnudi was the best thing I ate all night. These were little balls of pasta topped with sage in a brown butter truffle sauce. Can't really go wrong with those flavors. \n\nThe main dishes we tried were the salmon and lamb. The salmon was named \"salt and pepper\" salmon, but was bland and underseasoned to me. The skin was crispy but the fish itself was just mediocre. The latke was the best thing on the plate. The sauce was way too overpowering on the horseradish and the big chunks of apple and beets were just out of place. I tried a piece of the lamb and thought it was well cooked, but did not wow me. \n\nOur server was nice, but a little too much nervous energy for me. She kept asking how our \"wonderful dishes were tasting.\" She brought me out the wrong cider which is an honest mistake, but I don't think she was really paying attention most of the night.\n\nI think the menu items all sound really good but they just don't deliver to the expectations I had. Steven Starr restaurants are usually consistently good, but this fell flat for me. To top it off, this place is ridiculously overpriced. To charge 5 dollars for whole grain rolls and butter is a crime, even if they are \"cast iron cooked.\" Thirteen bucks for a quarter filled bowl of soup is unnecessary. It feels like you are getting nickel and dimed the whole time when you're trying to have a nice meal out. I'll think twice before coming back anytime soon."

We all quickly got drinks (I highly recommend the Broken Arrow) and a review of the menu and specials.  They were even flexible with a few special needs in our parties.\n\nWe split a handful of apps.  The cheese board was well sized.

There was a lot of food envy with the various dishes each co-worker ordered!\n\nThe dessert menu left us with plenty of choices, yet they still had a few off menu options for consideration.

I wanted to love it like everyone else seems to, but the only component that was flawless was the setting. Unfortunately, the food lacked the seasoning expected of the restaurant's southern flair and the service, while friendly, was incredibly rushed. It's one thing for a chef to want the entire order put in at once. It's another for the waitstaff to want to take away remaining food to make room for more or to deliver the check as they're asking if you'd like dessert. I understand turning tables and covid time limits, but we were out the (very heavy) door an hour after we arrived for a highly-anticipated, leisurely dinner. It was tremendously disappointing.

My nephew and I had the Summer Corn and Black Truffle Risotto and the Skewered Shrimp Salad and both were fantastic. Perfect, light small plates. For an entree we had the Fried chicken, buttery corn grits, collard greens and comeback sauce. It was amazing!"

Nothing beats a warm roll with chive butter. Nice selection of cheese and plenty of toast to go around. Fried chicken was excellent! Juicy and flavorful sides come with. Husband had fish curry that was delish which he finished his plate. \nThe only thing I could complain about was didn't care for the dessert/ cocktail selection. \nEverything else was great and have been wanting to check this place out for a while."

        "text": "I stopped in at The Love, Steven Starr's latest offering, for a late bite and a drink and liked it so much, I came back for dinner, with more mixed results.\n\nThe space feels surprisingly cozy considering how large the restaurant actually is. Service is friendly and attentive, and food arrived at a good pace. I'd strongly recommend a reservation if you want to dine at a table, but if you don't have a reservation, the bar is first-come first-serve and has the same menu as the restaurant.\n\nThe menu feels like the American South-meets-Italy. The bartender described one of their appetizers, the gnocco fritto, as savory beignets, and she was spot on. It's also our favorite appetizer - fluffy puffs of dough served with mortadella and savory onion jam. The poke, though beautifully plated, was seasoned very unevenly, so some bites were very salty while others had no flavor. Big plate-wise, we loved the fried chicken, which came boneless yet perfectly crispy, tender, and juicy and served with sides of collard greens and creamy grits. In the short rib stroganoff dish, I loved that the short rib was served as a single piece of tender, glazed, slow-cooked meat, as opposed to mixed together with the egg noodles, mushrooms, and cream sauce. The scallops with tangerine butter were cooked perfectly, though the tangerine butter tasted less like tangerine and more like a vaguely citrusy, sugary butter.\n\nAs at all other Starr restaurants, the cocktails at The Love are great. I've tried and really enjoyed their take on a mule (with mezcal and cranberry cider), their \"very good bourbon drink\" (which was dangerously smooth and well balanced). The desserts were enjoyable, though not particularly memorable (I think we got the matcha ice cream and some kind of chex mix sundae.)\n\nThe menu skews on the expensive side considering the size of the portions and the casual feel of the place: appetizers (or \"creative pantry beginnings\") are $15-$20, pastas are $17-$23 for small plates, and the big plates (or \"a real meal\") are in the $30s range. The water also costs $1pp for filtered water, offered sparkling or still. (Unfiltered tap water is free.) All the dishes are quite shareable, but if you order in the conventional appetizer-entr\u00e9e-dessert + drink format, the meal can easily edge up to at least $60-70pp. I do hope they plan to change the menu at least a few times a year - I like the concept but during my second visit, our party felt that the menu especially in the \"creative pantry section\" (perhaps a misnomer?), was quite small and limited."

Our server, Kiara, was awesome: extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The best thing we had was the complimentary hush puppies with ramp remoulade. The kale fettuccine with mushrooms and ramps was also very tasty. We ordered the Lovebird (fried chicken) with collard greens and grits, and the Hot and Sour Halibut. The chicken was good - not great. I've had better fried chicken in other places in Philly, as well as in the suburbs. The collard greens and grits were nothing spectacular. We did like the halibut- it was cooked perfectly, but the flavors in the dish were too much. After a few bites I was done with it.\nNothing was terrible in the experience, but nothing was outstanding either. Just average, hence three stars."

Being a New York native, I find it challenging to find delicious and fresh food better than what I have available to me at home; however, this restaurant was both creative and innovative with their dishes. I had the Scallops. They were very tender with a crisp top, the insides were cooked perfectly. For dessert I ordered the Olive Oil Cake (not exactly what you'd crave for dessert, I know) it was fantastic. The fluffy cake was paired with a rosemary honey and a fig and balsamic ice cream. Absolutely refreshing, light and delicious. This place is a must for Ros\u00e8 lovers, the Cava was fruity and the fine bubbles paired beautifully with my meal. I would recommend this restaurant to any foodie in the Philadelphia/Rittenhouse area."

The goddess dip was delicious and there was a nice variety of unexpected veggies. I would pass on the cheese ball in the future. The flavors didn't quite come through as described- not worth it.  I got the Turkey Melt which was by no means bad, but left a little something to be desired. I tasted the Ricotta Ravioli and thought it was pretty good.

I wanted to eat it with a spoon. Shared with the table, but only because I'm nice that way. The cauliflower risotto caught my eye as soon as I saw it on the menu. Stupidly assumed it was cauliflower but it was rice and cauliflower. It was delicious although I wish I'd asked about it. I thought it was riced cauliflower prepared like risotto. We had chicken piccata with spaghetti, salmon bowl, and a ravioli dish. The risotto and chicken dishes were very large for lunch servings, so we were thrilled we weren't eating the other two items."

The lights are low, bar is cute, music is somewhat trendy.\n\nI give 5 star reviews for food quality, great service, a nice ambiance, and consistency. You'll get that here. For some reason,  I wasn't thrilled when my friend made a dinner reservation here but I am so so happy that she did! We had the best girls night out. Everything was amazing. We talked about it days later.\n\nSo we started with drinks. I had Love Drunk which is an apple ginger mule. Got it because.. a seasonal mule. It was ok. It arrived with a lot of ice and tasted watered down. No one ever wants a watered down drink. I ordered the margarita next. It was better but nothing to write home about.\n\nWe shared the kale salad. The brioche croutons..omg and it was topped with tons of Parmesan, yum! The apples were a nice seasonal touch. We kept with the seasonal vibe throughout dinner. We also shared the ginger miso collard greens. SO GOOD. They were so cozy and different. \n\nI ordered the ricotta ravioli for my main, pumpkin & parmesan sauce.. yes please! Thee coziest meal ever. Must order. Wow, after writing this, I realize my entire meal was vegetarian.  My friend ordered the scallops and really enjoyed it. \n\nThe dessert menu is amazing but we were way to stuffed to order anything.

It's seasonal new-American, and while it didn't blow my socks off, it's a very solid option especially if you want to dine outdoors. It was their first day (and hour!) opening since the quarantine. We weren't sure what their outdoor dining would look like, but it was like Parc where the tables were on the exterior. It was surprisingly nice to sit on the street! No view of Rittenhouse square but it was a bit quieter than that super busy area also which we liked. Of course, the servers wore masks and we had disposable menus, but everything else about the experience was pretty much the same as usual-- the staff all were super fantastic, accommodating, and friendly!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n Lots of Ros\u00e9 +  Moscow mules (seasonal) - Loved the mule! Wasn't too sweet and was super refreshing!\n Scallop Crudo - Silky and buttery, the presentation was beautiful. \n Summer corn & black truffle Risotto - Indulgently creamy without being too heavy. We LOVED the shishitos on top. \n Crabcake - An ideal crabcake-- big enough to share, although probably wouldn't share next time around \n\nWe weren't too hungry, but we will certainly be back to try the Parker rolls, a pasta, and one of their desserts! (these items would probably be their biggest hits)  \n\nHighlights were the servers/staff (seriously the best service!!), and the variety of different seasonal and delicious food options.

As soon as we arrived, the hostess quickly approached us asking whether we'd like to sit indoors or outdoors - we chose to sit outside. It was one of the last few weekends of the summer!\n\nWe started our brunch off with a couple drinks - a beer for him and the Dear Prudence cocktail for me. Both were promptly served. My cocktail was kind of disappointing. It came with gin, Drambuie, grapefruit and champagne. The waitress warned me that the cocktail would have a whiskey taste to it because of the Drambuie but I was totally fine with that. Honestly, that's what pushed me to get it. It was something different from my usual drink of choice. Sadly, I didn't get that \"whiskey taste\" at all. The drink was pretty weak and I later wished I had just ordered a glass of champagne or wine instead of the cocktail. \n\nThe Always Sunny Turkey Melt that I ordered for my entree was alright. The roasted turkey was good, but I felt like the egg was a little over cooked and the English muffin it came on was dry. I think it would have tasted a lot better if the egg was a bit runny. My entree came with a side of potatoes and a salad which were both grwat. I especially enjoyed the potatoes. They were really well cooked and tasty. \n\nAll of the staff at The Love was very sweet. I appreciated the prompt service and our waitress checking in on us during our meal. For dessert, we enjoyed some carrot cake and the team was kind and thoughtful enough to include a \"Happy Birthday\" message on the plate after finding out we were there for a birthday celebration. \n\nDespite the good service though, I won't be hurrying back here due to the subpar food. The restaurant is quite beautiful, so if I am to return, it would be to check out the inside and I'd likely just stick to a glass of wine and get my food elsewhere."

The Parker rolls arrived hot and with an amazing chive butter that I would eat all the time if I could. The gnudi came in this lovely sauce/broth. They tasted like a fluffy ball of cheese, they were so decadent. The Brussels were fried and on the greasy side. The standout dish for me was the smoked trout. It's a whole fish, perfectly deboned, with the loveliest smoky goodness. The side of grains were slightly sweet and acidic and just balanced so nicely.\n\nThe meal is going well. But then... 3 separate people (not our server) stopped by in the course of less than 5 minutes asking us if we were still enjoying our food and if they could take anything away. \n\nMaybe you think of this as great service.

They do a really good job of making some southern classics fancy and delicious.\n\nWe started with the hushpuppies and crispy duck salad. Both were excellent. I would definitely go for their starters over a side. I wanted to try pretty much everything on the appetizer menu. The hush puppies had a little spice to them and the accompanying butter was amazing. The duck was fried perfectly and was nicely complimented by strawberry's and a mustard dressing - perfect for the summer time.\n\nFor main courses, I got the Pork Chop and my girlfriend got the Lovebird fried chicken (which seems to be what they are known for). She definitely picked the better entree. If I were to return, it would be tough to not just pick that. The buttermilk batter was friend perfectly and the chicken was not dry in the least. We got a side of fried potatoes, which were really good especially with the onion remoulade, but not necessary. We didn't eat many of them but not because of their preparation.\n\nAll in all, this is definitely one of the best place I have eaten in Philly so far.

The only thing that Work make it better was if it came with rice to help you finish all the curry gravy. The side dish of Brussels sprouts is very good too. The mushroom toast was a great appetizer and was bigger than I expected."

My current favorites are the eggnog and the hot toddy. \n\nI've dined here twice now and recommend the cheese plate, the veal lasagna, and the short rib stroganoff. I honestly did not enjoy the Gnudi at all - it was recommended to me by our waitress over the ravioli. It was definitely filling despite the small portion but the taste wasn't what I had hoped for. The balls of  sponge-like potato were a little bland and seemed to be tossed with what tasted too much like salad dressing.\n\nAll in all a good spot - hard to get a reservation at times so I advise planning ahead."

This was especially weird when it started raining and we were mostly covered but still getting when the wind blew, but there was no offer to move us to clearly open tables (I know, they may have been reserved) and no acknowledgement of the fact that we were getting wet (yes, I know --- we knew the risks to choosing outdoor seating). Thankfully, it was a quick sprinkle and we definitely enjoyed our brunch regardless. \n\nOtherwise, the food and the service were both fabulous. Our waitress (I believe she said her name was Jah) was friendly, attentive without being overbearing, willing to offer suggestions as needed, and supportive in allowing us to take our time when we told her we were hanging out in anticipation of an afternoon matinee.\n\nOur drinks were delicious --- my friend ordered several espresso martinis and I quite enjoyed The Boss, a whiskey cocktail made with apple cider and champagne that was bright and fruity. \n\nWe ordered a few items to share so we could sample both sweet and savory items. We started with the pumpkin spice mini scones, which had perfect texture and were served with a cinnamon cream cheese frosting that was excellent. The shrimp and grits were cheesy and delicious with well cooked shrimp, and the Turkey Avocado Melt was well balanced and came with crispy home fries --- both brunch entrees were delightful, but I think the shrimp and grits was probably the highlight.\n\nThough our stomachs were full, we wound up ordering a dessert since we had more time to spare (and dessert goes in a separate stomach, right?). We opted for the brownie skillet, topped with graham cracker ice cream and a peanut brittle, and this turned out to be an excellent choice.\n\nAll in all, a great experience, and I hope to try dinner at The Love someday, too!"

Parker house rolls weren't a big hit either ( nor were they Parker house rolls, but I digress)\nService was very pleasant. I get it.

The LOve is very different from Parc but very classy and serving Italian food. The ambience is so old worldly and really cozy. We were seated within a few\nMinutes of showing for our reservation and the service was great through out. \n\nThe cocktails are standard center city prices and both me and my husband loved our cocktails. The server gave us enough time to first choose the cocktails and then the food and started us off with some complimentary bites. We got the veggies with a dip and the pumpkin soup as appetizers and both were good but we could have probably tried another appetizer instead of the veggie with a dip. \n\nOur entrees the Lobster spaghetti and the Gnudi pasta were both delicious but a were small on the portion size. We decided to get the dessert to makeup for the small entrees and ordered the cranberry bar with toasted pecan ice cream which was also great. We had a great night at The Love and will surely go back again."

Never left with an empty glass of water. Our food came out pretty fast. \n\nFood: deserves a 3/5. For being a Starr restaurant, I didn't think it was anything over the top. For example, there wasn't anything special about the Eat Your Veggies appetizer. The goddess dip was good, but nothing great and the veggies had no seasoning on it. Not worth $10. The butternut ravioli squash was decent, but I've had tastier. It was a little too rich for me. My friend said the chicken dish he got was delicious but I didn't try any (vegetarian). I do recommend the Parker house rolls...so fresh! They come in the cast iron skillet and the butter is a great touch. Also the torched broccoli was probably my favorite part (along with the grits!). \n\nOverall, decent place but didn't live up the Stephen Starr quality in my opinion."

The poke app dish was also good and quite large for an appetizer which is surprising for a fancy place like this. \n\nThe pastas here are some of the best in town so be sure to come with a group and try them all. \n\nThe entrees are kind of boring and nothing to write home about. The fried chicken comes with collard greens and grits. They should really sub out the grits for something like mashed potatoes. The curry fish looks pretty but lacks substance and tastes like nothing. It should be served on a bed of something. The ribs are fun to eat but the rack I was served was quite severely charred. I guess this place isn't a bbq joint for a reason. \n\nThe bread rods on the table are fun to munch on. I like to pretend they are cigarettes and tuck them between my index and middle finger while I chat at the dinner table. \n\nThe saffron soda was undrinkable.\n\nI will probably come back in the future when they change up the menu. I can't wait to see what pastas they cook up in the future. I'll skip the entrees though."

It's familiar but different, adds in the extra star power when necessary and pulls back to let the food shine. \n\nWe came here for a Valentine's day brunch. We scored reservations early and planned ahead so we can park on one of the side streets and then make our walk over. Located where a lot of the action is, it's a well known spot and knows it. \n\nWe were seated in the upstairs wing by the windows. It was a nice morning out so the people watching was pretty decent as was the general view of the outside. As with many places when dining out during COVID, we were limited to 90 minutes for our meal. We had to wear masks when moving around and only allowed to remove when seated and while eating or drinking. \n\nOur waiter started us off with waters and coffee and read off a special of strawberry scones with lavendar whipped cream as part of their Valentine's day menu. We were intrigued and ordered those in addition to our mains - a turmeric ravioli for her and a beet risotto for myself. There was some mix up with our scones and our neighboring table received our order. It was fixed in a jiffy and the waiter was nice enough to comp the scones given the snafu - thank you!\n\nThe meal was delish! I loved the fresh scones and lavender infused whipped cream it came with. Great way to start a brunch - filled with flaky bits of butter and carbs!\n\nWe worked our way through the scones pretty quickly and when our mains came out, we were ready to switch it up to something savory. The meals were definitely well developed and each bite had exceptional flavor! \n\nOur service was great - plenty of check ins, water and coffee refills, and friendly attitude. The ambiance in the place is whimsical and comfy, and we're made to feel the same from our service experience. \n\nOverall, had a great time trying out this place and hoping to keep coming back as the weather starts to get better!"

Despite the fact that we had been 30 minutes late to our reservation, they sat us down relatively quickly and made sure we were served as soon as possible. The restaurant, admittedly is quite busy, so it did take us a while to get our food. To start off, we ordered the Sriracha Bacon Candy. In all honesty, the sriracha was a bit hard to pinpoint and it tasted like regular bacon--was not worth $12 in my opinion. For individual dishes, we ordered the Turkey Avocado Melt, Exotic Mushroom Risotto, Ricotta Ravioli, and a special dish of the day, Sausage Gravy. I enjoyed the Turkey Avocado Melt a lot, but there was nothing unique about it. The muffin also got soggy very quickly, so it tasted like mesh after sitting for a while. The Mushroom Risotto had a strong wine taste and was difficult to finish. The Ravioli, similarly, was hard to eat since it was so dense. If we didn't have water, it would've been impossible to swallow. The Sausage Gravy, as my friend described, tasted like McDonalds. Although the service was lovely here, the food was not worth the price."

        "text": "In the heart of Rittenhouse Square sits The Love, an impossibly popular restaurant that is a great choice for just about every occasion. It's massive (indoors is pretty standard size-wise but they've got a huge outdoor set), warm, homey and feels refined but not too upscale. I've tried to get a last-minute reservation here multiple times when visiting Philly, but that virtually never works, so props to my mom for booking us in early. The food is delicious and abundantly flavorful, with plenty of good options for the veggie-obsessed like me and proper omnivores like the rest of the population. It's not cheap, but portions are quite substantial. \n\nCame here at 8:15 on a Saturday night as a party of 6. Philly still has this strange pandemic rule where you can't book a table for more than five people, but the savvy among us know to book a table of four and a table of two and kindly request that these tables are near one another. My mom said that the restaurant couldn't guarantee we'd be close by, but we fortunately were. And funnily enough, there was a four-and-two family gathering right next to us who had done the same thing. We gotta get resourceful in this world!\n\nWe started off with cocktails, which I had been eagerly anticipating. My parents have been to the Love a bunch of times and rave about the cocktails here. They were decent but not memorable. I first tried The Perfect Pear (Vodka, Gin, Pear, Ginger, Bonal), which is advertised as a martini but it's honestly more of a gimlet-style drink. Cinnamon sugar rim, which is not my favorite addition to a drink in general but I managed. For my second drink I got the 18th Street Manhattan, which was magical and absolutely deadly if you're not careful. Definitely a highlight for me. \n\nThe Love's dinner menu is pretty varied, seasonal with a bit of quirk. As I mentioned, portion sizes are surprisingly large, so you may end up needing to take home a baggie of leftovers (not a bad problem to have). If I had to think of one shortcoming, it would be that some of the dressings/sauces were a bit much. All were super flavorful and yummy, I just think they overdid it. Otherwise, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience. Eats, below:\n\nCrispy Duck Salad w/ baby lettuces, butterscotch pears, fresh herbs and ginger vinaigrette: A-\nThis should not be categorized as an appetizer -- massive salad with a very generous piece of duck. But it was yummy, juicy, great all the same. The rest of the salad was okay, nothing too special, though duck and sweet pears together make a fantastic combo. \n\nLine-Caught Tuna Crudo w/ avocado, lime, seeded rice crisps, black garlic &\u00a0kimchee\u00a0dressings: A\nFun and playful presentation with many components that worked beautifully together. The crisps were tasty on their own but also great vessels for the tuna, and the dressings were both insanely delicious. Unlike the rest of what we ordered, dressings here were served in little dollops around the plate, so you can choose how much or how little you choose to indulge.\n\nSweet & Savory Fried Fall Brussel Sprouts w/ alpine cheese fondue and apple cider drizzle: A-\nA great fall Brussels dish is one of my favorite things on this earth, and this was nearly there. I just found the sauce a bit heavy-handed and didn't even go for the fondue because there was plenty going on with the sprouts themselves. More of dousing than a \"drizzle\". \n\nThai Salmon w/ spicy coconut red curry, broccoli-cabbage-pole bean saut\u00e9, fresh mango & lime puffs: A\nProbably our favorite dish of the night. The curry was special and infused the veggie saut\u00e9 with so much flavor. Coconut curry salmon is one of my favorite dishes to cook at home, though this preparation blew anything I've ever tried out of the water. Something to aspire to!"

I am not really a fan of cheese plates and undercooked meats, which was what i had seen on the Yelp pics. Well baby, thank goodness I didn't let the menu nor the photos deter me! First off, we started with drinks, I had the Fig and Lemon and my friend had the Broken Arrow. BOTH drinks were very good, my F&L was smooth and sexy, the Broken Arrow was kinda fun & it wasn't too sweet, just perfect. These three very thin, tall, branch-like sticks in a mason jar just chilling on the edge of the table caught my eye. Once I realized that they were actually breadsticks, I just had to try them. Lemme tell you summin' to be so thin and almost unnoticeable they packed a hell of a flavor. So tasty, so light and so addictive. If my summer body wasn't this close I would've asked for another serving. The chef complimented us with a duck appetizer (I forget the name, it was like duck bruschetta). This was our first time trying duck, neither of us became fans of it, but we were very thankful for the compliment. I started with the mushroom toast (insert Rick Flair Woooooooo!) omg, that sourdough smothered in that creme with those mushrooms was delectable. I was tempted to get an order to go. My friend had the fig Caesar salad, at first I was like oh, that looks nice. But when I tasted it, it was pretty darn good. He had an extra side of fig and that def bumped up the flavor. For dinner I had the lobster spaghetti and he had the fried chicken which came with a side of grits and collards. And to top it off we had the strawberry shortcake for desert (yum) If ever I had any inkling of a doubt abt this place, it is definitely been laid to rest. And not to mention our waiter Tyler was awesome. He had an exemplary knowledge of the selections and gave beautiful details when asked abt various selections. To say that we were both very, very pleased is an understatement! I am def adding this to my list of go-to's & recommendations!"

Sadly it just seems that they aren't really doing anything exciting in the kitchen. \n\nWe had sweet and sour fish and Korean ribs. Our waiter warned us that both were spicy, but I could barely detect even a hint of spice in either. The fish had a nice glaze, and the broth it came in was a tasty mix of Chinese flavors, but the dish lacked a starch so seemed incomplete. The ribs were good, but they had a sweet barbecue sauce that had nothing Korean about it. The cornbread and green bean slaw were excellent but once again puzzlingly devoid of any Korean flavors. I also tried a non-alcoholic cocktail with salted cherry but it was oddly watery and I couldn't taste salted cherry (theme of the evening, I guess). \n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal but it was very normcore and simply not worth the price.

        "text": "The Culinary Adventures of Tom Coghlan, FB\n\nThe second Starr Restaurant I chose for my Starr Restaurant series was The Love! A \"New American Cuisine\" restaurant by Aimee Olexy. Aimee first got my Attention about 20 years ago with L'ange Bleu (The Blue Angel) A remarkable French Restaurant on Chestnut St. near Independence Hall, that at the time was my FAVORITE! Regrettably it has since closed...She also presently manages Talula's Garden and Talula's Daily, also in collaboration with Steven Starr...Me and my friend Pamela arrived at The Love on 18th St and Sansom for brunch. We secured two seats at the bar and our server quickly got us two Mimosas to start out with...followed by two more... After some deliberation we chose to share Olivia's Cheese Ball, lavender, pistachio, fig-honey and crisps. It was truly wonderful! It was accompanied by lightly toasted bread crisps. The aroma of lavender worked well with the flavors of pistachio, fig, honey and the soft cheese. I then had an asparagus soup served with crouton and sour cream that was AMAZING! So fresh, and different! From there, my friend Pamela ordered, Fried Catfish & Hushpuppy Platter, Wild Chesapeake Catfish and fresh vegetable slaw, while I ordered Shrimp and Grits, southern spiced shellfish sauce, onions and peppers. The Grits were unique in flavor, I think because of the southern spiced shellfish sauce, and they complimented the large fresh shrimp perfectly...I have ordered this dish at other restaurants, but surprisingly, none have compared to this ! Pamela, a southerner at heart, thoroughly enjoyed her Catfish & Hushpuppies as well... We washed it all down with a lovely bottle of Cotes'du'Rhone from Domaine des Chans Saud that our server so aptly recommended... It was perfect! Then dessert...Olive Oil Cake, balsamic fig ice cream and rosemary honey...To me, this seemed an odd combination... And maybe it was, but I have to tell you... It worked! It worked remarkably well!! I will surely come back to The Love for more adventures..."

I started with the winter soup and ate every morsel. My fianc\u00e9e had the brisket fazzoletti and she usually doesn't eat the whole meal--- yup! Done and delicious (I had a bite!), friends got the Thai Salmon, cucumber feta salad and seafood cioppino and for dessert fianc\u00e9e and I did the brownie skillet. Everything was delicious, we had no left overs.\n\nQuick trick to help with the wait time, know at least what drinks you want. They are delicious. I suggest the mule's paradise for those mezcal and tequila lovers. Order the drink with the choice of water so when they return for dinner selection, you can order a second round!\n\nI would def return and probably see what next season has to offer. Looks like they change menu with what's available at the farms and it makes sense. Excellent time. Packed, make reservations AND be ready to be close and possibly hot. Masks are on and up but diners sitting free nose and mouths. Love The Love!"

It also was served in a small wine glass and tasted watered down. The $12 mimosas were served in a smaller than average square champagne flute. Word of advice: skip brunch cocktails all together here. \n\nThe $20 burger, while tasty, was not worth the price just because they toasted a heart on the bun. It was just an average burger served alongside cheese fondue for dipping. It came with bland whole roasted potatoes. My friend's omelette was also nothing to write home about and was served with the same sad potatoes. We ordered baby biscuits to share which were more like light fluffy buns. The maple cayenne butter enhanced them."

I ordered the Dreamweaver, a delightful bubbly cocktail with elderflower, grapefruit and ros\u00e9.  It is a great brunch drink.  My partner ordered the spicy bloody mary and it was not so spicy and more watery than bloody so not great.\n\nOur friend arrived and ordered a mimosa and we were seated.\nWe ordered: Olivia's cheese ball, the oyster fry, miniature cinnamon bun scones, the lox board, baby buttermilk biscuits and I had the fried chicken and waffle.\n\nThe food looked great, tasted great for the most part and we had a nice time enjoying the food.\n\nThe only thing I didn't care for were the 'crisps' with the cheese ball.  They were perfectly crispy, tiny slices of bread and it was a bit fiddly to get the cheese on to the them.  The ball wasn't soft enough to dig into with the crisps so one had to use a knife to get the cheese on the crisp - which was the size of my thumbnail, some smaller...so it was like buttering a small crouton.  But I managed - no points off for that...\n\nThe space is bright and nice for brunch and the lively conversation makes for a noisy environment so be prepared.\n\nWe would definitely go back for brunch at The Love and the food was good enough for me to consider going for lunch and dinner."

The portions were gigantic. Like, for a starter or app, I'm expecting a smaller plate, not an entr\u00e9e-sized plate of food. I ordered the duck salad and my husband ordered the tuna crudo for starters. For dinner our plans were to share the pork chop and the fried chicken meal. As soon as the apps came out I knew we had over-ordered. My salad was an entr\u00e9e sized salad and honestly I would have been fine with just that for the evening. My husband thought the tuna crudo was just okay. \n\nThe pork chop was good, but the sides weren't great. The peaches, which I was excited for, were hard and tasteless. The fried chicken was a basic fried chicken. It was pretty good. But it was heavy and needed a fresh component like a citrus. Instead, it came with comeback sauce, which was just way too much on the plate. The sauce added to the heaviness of the dish.\n\nFor dessert, we had the dirty chai cr\u00e8me brulee, which was really delish and the highlight of the night.\n\nSo, in summation: drinks, service and dessert was excellent. Food was merely okay."

After arriving to the restaurant a bit early for our reservation, we grabbed a small table in the bar area to enjoy a drink while we waited for our table. A waitress actually came over and took our drink order, but she seemed busy with other things so our drinks didn't come out until about 15 minutes later, just as they called our name. We were escorted into the elevator, to the second floor of the restaurant. Compared to the first floor, this dining area had a much more comfortable feel, like a cozy farm house.\n\nFor our appetizers, we shared some Parker house rolls and the duck salad. The rolls were decent, but the chive butter that accompanied them was awesome. I was a big fan of the duck salad, as it was basically just a crispy duck leg with some dressed greens on the side. Our main course consisted of the Lovebird (fried chicken) and the brisket fazzoletti (pasta). They were both absolutely delicious! Since it was Valentine's Day, we had to have dessert and opted for the chocolate mousse bar, which we both enjoyed very much.\n\nOverall, our experience at The Love was a fantastic one. After the small hiccup with the delay of our cocktails, the rest of the meal was a memorable one. I should also mention that we were seated on time (if not a little earlier) for our reservation. And the service was otherwise very good."

The potatoes were also excellent - crispy outside and done inside.\n\nThey invested in very nice outdoor street-side seating, with well ventilated, nice separation from adjoining tables and the sidewalk (though a bit close to passing cars- not much they can do about that).\n\nI'd say this is among the best brunch places in Philadelphia - we will be back!"

The atmosphere is somewhat farmhouse chic. We didn't have any wait and got a great little table by the window. Shawn was our server and she provided flawless service. She had a pleasant demeanor and extensive knowledge of the menu. She was always eager to help! Now, I'm southern, so when I noticed the menu had a few southern inspired dishes, I was intrigued to try out a northern attempt at southern food. The Love did not disappoint. The fried green tomatoes with whipped pimento cheese were amazing. The shrimp and grits were great - I was surprised at how well they did grits! This dish is rich, but I knew what I was getting myself into. My husband had a turkey sandwich and it was quite good. I also wanted a vanilla iced coffee and Shawn went out of her way to make it happen. All in all an excellent experience and I'd \"love\" to come back!

At the servers recommendation, I ordered the ribs and they were some of the best ribs I've had in Philly. They were juicy and tender, with a crunchy yet saucy outer crust. It was really impressively made, and was served with a delicious butter and cumin corn bread. My fianc\u00e9 got the pappardelle  pasta for her meal and she loved it.  We would both order those meals again in a heartbeat. We were too full for dessert, but since it was my fianc\u00e9's birthday, the waiter brought out a berry crumble and a candle on a cutely decorated plate.

I actually think their pancakes were the best pancakes I've ever had - if any pancake could be described as being exquisite, it would be the Lemon Poppy Pancakes at The Love! \n\nThe fancy location, charming ambiance, high quality service, and delicious food comes with a price tag though.

        "text": "BRUNCH:  I asked my server Jenna if either the buttermilk biscuits or the scones were worth the carb count and she gleamed when recommending the Lemon-Lavender Scones. She was filled with warmth when it came to advice. The assembly of lemon curd with a creamy whip and blueberries was an expected winner. What I didn't expect was the perfect warm temp from the oven, the delicate crunch outside and the flaky tenderness inside with each bite. Being small, they could have been either too \"done\" (like lavender rocks) or not done enough, remaining doughy inside. Not so here; the flavor, temp and texture were superb from first bite to last aided by their small size. Jenna said, \"I love to start brunch with something a little sweet.\"  She's right. Brunch is such a home-y, comfy meal that you should start off by tasting \"the love.\" The Fruit and Berry Bowl featured fresh fruit that wasn't drowned in yoghurt. Here too, balance was achieved. You could draw some of the rich, slightly tangy yoghurt with each bite of fruit since it was dolloped around the dish, not mounded beneath. And the toasted almonds gave just the right nutty texture and crunch. The portion size was perfect; not too much, not too little. The best thing was that everything was worth eating. How many times do you see a fruit bowl and dread the lurking honeydew? That melon is often downright nasty- creating a \"honey, don't\" moment for being over-ripe to the point that it can't hold a cube shape, or so under-ripe that it's colorless, tasteless and tough. Mystery Fruit. Each piece of melon here was delicious in this dish! Again, somebody \"back of the house\" cared. It didn't come to me because it should have been OK; someone determined it was worth serving. The place was packed on July 4that 12:30 and I arrived a bit early. So it took a little while for my eggs to arrive. But just as soon as I started to wonder about that, Jenna appeared to say that she was keeping her eye out for me since the eggs were taking longer than expected. That simple gesture showed that my server cared. That kind of awareness is becoming too rare these days. The Posh Brunch provided a nice mix of \"upscale\" and \"down-home.\"  The eggs were luscious. They were also perfectly hot, right from the kitchen. How often do you wait for eggs and when they finally arrive, you can't even eat them for being stone cold? These eggs were worth the wait in every respect- deftly flavored with a musky-woodsy scent of truffle that wasn't overdone, and light as a cloud in a soft curd; not so soft as to be French (like loose polenta) nor too tight either. They were right for a Soul-Food vibe. And the portion size was appropriate. That said, I could have gone for about a tablespoon or two more of the eggs. The spinach (tasty) was a bit lost below, particularly due to the abundance of lettuce with vinaigrette that created the most volume on the plate. The simple roasted potatoes were welcome. I mused that the simplicity of all the veg allowed the truffled eggs to shine. That said, I might have wished for a more upscale treatment of the potato...Something like a hot potato salad with celery, scallions, bacon in a warm bacon-red wine vinaigrette would have added another luscious element with the eggs. With an opening mimosa and a specialized drink I requested for my eggs, I had a terrific meal. I wanted a tomato juice drink but hate those 'frat boy' Bloody Marys that dare you to imbibe as many Scoville units as possible before calling the paramedics. The bar tender created a lovely tomato and muddled cucumber vodka cocktail for me with a fragrant bouquet of fresh basil on top. It was as insightful as the fare it accompanied.   Fine Food, Fantastic Service.  Go!"

Not a lot of places I know have hush puppies and the ones here are so good idk what I like better the hush puppies or the chive butter that come with them.  The shrimp n grits is probably the dish I order the most. The honey comb dessert is delicious and such a nice blend of flavors but the brownie skillet is a safe bet if you don't want to risk something new. I miss the cinnamon bun scones but they have rotating flavors and the lemon berry scones look good just haven't tried them yet. The sriracha bacon candy  is a must try!"

The service was great, super attentive and helpful with making recommendations. We tried the Ravioli, The Fried Chicken, and the Short Rib Pasta. All 3 entrees were a 10/10! For apps we shared the Kale Caesar salad, Hush puppies, and Rolls with Chive Butter. Again, all 3 apps were a 10/10! For drinks we tried the Broken Arrow and let's just say after 3 rounds of those we still couldn't get enough lol. I'm only taking one star off because the restaurant wouldn't seat me until the entire party arrived and with covid that meant standing out in the cold. Other than that 9/10 would highly recommend and cannot wait to visit again soon"

I ordered a champagne, and she asked if I wanted to open or close the tab. I closed it out. No problem. Then, I noticed that everyone else didn't get their check until they were ready to leave. I even polled the people who were sitting down, and yes. I was the only one singled out with the pre-pay method. I asked the bartender about it, and she said, \"It's because you are eating in the dining area. And since you showed me your method of paying, I wasn't going to make you pay anyway.\" She gave a few excuses, none of which made sense. The only think I could deduce that was different from the other folks at the bar, one of whom was also having dinner at a table, was I was black. \n\nI left feeling very good about speaking up for myself.

We ordered quite a few dishes to get a sampling of their offerings. Most of them were amazing. However, we felt the fig caesar salad was weak.  Boyfriend asked if I minded if he told the server what he thought, and I said I didn't, so long as we balanced it with raving about how amazing the crispy duck salad was (one of the best dishes there, IMO.) We told her, and before we knew it, the general manager was right there, apologizing, and we ended up getting a free cucumber salad. Nice move, GM!\n\nHonestly, the whole experience was great, thanks to him.\n\nOne suggestion-stop charging for the Parker rolls. Yes, they're delicious, but bread really should come free, in my opinion. Esp when you're dropping nearly $200 for dinner. \n\nAlso, don't bother ordering the coffee.  It was very weak. But I haven't found many restaurants of this caliber offering good coffee, which is a shame because I love a good coffee when I'm eating a totally delicious decadent dessert, which The Love has in spades."

We walked up to the hostess stand and checked in. And we advised that we preferred indoor seating,  even though they do provide outdoor seating that is socially distanced, but close to foot and car traffic. \n\nWe were escorted to our table, and was immediately greeted by our server. He explained the menu and gave us a moment to overlook it. Upon his return, we ordered two teas with a flavored sweetner. After a moment of reviewing the menu again, we made our choices: Me: Lovebird (Buttermilk Fried Chicken, buttery corn grits, comeback sauce, and collard greens; Hubby: Honey Brined Pork Chop; also, hubby ordered us the Whole Grain Cast-iron Baked 'Parker House Rolls.' For dessert: Dirty Chai Creme Brulee \n\nEverything was spot on. And as a person of color, those grits and collards hit the spot!!

The food here was absolutely amazing!\n\nFirst off, the ambiance was quite nice.  Kinda like, southern chic meets Tuscany, if that makes any sense.  They also have private, outdoor dining that is also heated, so that's something else to consider when booking.\n\nNow for the food.  We started off with drop biscuits, which some with chive butter.  Warm, moist, and delicious!  The butter really compliments the biscuits, and it was absolutely worth holding to the side for our entrees.  Next up, we had the mushroom risotto and the spicy fried chicken.  The risotto was absolutely unbelievable, one of the best I've ever had.  It's a little runnier than you typically see, almost as if they were attempting to recreate an oatmeal (as if it were breakfast, but it's risotto).  Very, very enjoyable texture, and seriously, it was soooo good.  The fried chicken is basically a whole chicken.  Two absolutely huge pieces of white meat, fried so well, with a great spice and awesome flavor.  Absolutely recommend!   That sauce, wow!\n\nAnd on top of all that, the service was absolutely awesome.  Very attentive, very friendly.  We will definitely be going back!"

Due to an easing of restrictions they recommended that we get some cocktails-to-go and take an evening stroll in the square.  The Broken Arrow & Wild & Free were certainly tasty drinks (on the sweeter side) but I wouldn't call them unique.\n\nAfter we returned to be seated, we ordered the Crab Cake and Brisket Fazzoletti which were both excellent. They definitely do not skimp you on crabmeat in the cake and the lemon aioli provides a nice balance. The garlic ricotta adds smooth creaminess  to each bite of Brisket & Pasta.\n\nWe normally skip dessert, but the Bee Sweet Sundae caught our interest. The toffee and lemon cake were a great texture contrast to the ice cream.  However I wouldn't say that the ice cream flavoring is well represented. We would have been able to tell that it was different, but had we not known that it was chamomile, neither of us would have been able to pinpoint it."

We were stoked because we have been hearing such great reviews, and we felt that the food 100% met the expectations, but we were let down with some of the service.\n\nOur reservations were set for 9:00PM, we arrived at 9:10 and were told they were clearing some tables & should be seated soon. After 30 minutes of standing outside under a heat lamp, they decided to bring us some warmed wine. This was a nice gesture, but less than a minute after receiving this, our hostess came and told us our table was ready (so just felt like a little too late). When were seated, we actually didn't meet our server until 15 minutes later, and she just jumped right into seeing if we were ready to order. There was no introduction or offering of running through the menu. We ended up not leaving until about 11:45. Unfortunately, it was kind of uncomfortable the entire time because my wicker chair felt like it was going to collapse, it was so unstable. I think they even noticed it, and offered us an additional dessert for free. Which again, was a nice gesture, but we were already so full - it would have been more appreciated to have the 1 dessert we ordered comped or something. \n\nGiven it is COVID, I get it - restaurants are still figuring things out, but it seems to be pretty common practice to have expectations for tables to be cleared on time and held to a time limit. If it wasn't the pandemic, I would have given them 3 stars at most. \n\nAll of that to be said, everything we had was delicious, and I can't emphasize this enough.\n\nWhole Grain Cast-Iron Baked 'Parker House Rolls'   $6\nThis really hit the mark, from how it was presented to how it tasted. Brought out right in the cast iron pan, still warm when we got it, so the chive butter just melted for every bite. It was doughy - but still light, and perfect for cleaning that soup bowl!\n\nCreamy Mushroom Soup\u00a0 \u00a0 $13\nEveryone is on the same truffle train right? Like, put that on anything, we have to try it. The soup was rich and creamy, and the parm & sage were the perfect combo to cut some of the earthy tones from the truffle & mushrooms. Excellent dish for a cold night outside. \n\nRicotta Ravioli  $26\nOkay - looking at the price, it seems a bit high for ravioli, but this plate was really impressive, and the portion size was fair. I rarely ever have the chance to eat a plate with saffron on it, but this was a nice floral/light note to add to a heavier dish. This pairing with the pistachio crumble & chili vinaigrette made for a really complex flavor. \n\nPulled Brisket Fazzoletti  $28\nThis dish was super. Felt like a home-cooked meal, something your mom would make. Just an amazing combination of sweet and savory in every bite. \n\nApple Marzipan Tea Cake $11\nThe cake itself wasn't overly impressive - it was good, but didn't pack a punch or provide a memorable moment like the dishes mentioned above. The whipped creme fraiche was a nice touch. \n\nBee Sweet Sundae  $11\nThis dessert could have easily stolen the show for me. The honeycomb toffee was amazing, and provided a yummy crunch to the ice cream. The fig & lemon cake gave it some fresh notes and served as a great addition to the dish. \n\nSo would I go back...I believe the food was good enough to definitely visit again, and just hope for a better overall experience."

The food was a real culinary experience and the ingredients are really high quality. Also really unique flavors. Overall I rate the experience a 4.5 stars. I can't get the full 5 stars because I felt like my entree and tuna app was slightly on the smaller size. The service was also missing a personal touch that would have completed the experience. It felt like they just got us in and out fairly quickly without much interaction from the wait staff. What was really amazing from the Love were their sides.

We showed up a little early for our reservation and had to wait outside for about 10 mins, which was fine because there were like gas heaters we stood next to to keep warm. When we entered the dining area, it was very nice. We were seated in an area with 3 other groups. Our waiter, Michael, arrived to our table a few mins after and asked about drinks. Everything that came out of his mouth was so rushed as if he needed to be somewhere else instead of servicing us. After bringing our drinks,we only seen Michael at our table 3 additional times,including the time he brought the check over. Michael made sure that he was present at all of the tables in our section expect for ours. Someone that appeared to be a hostess actually came and took our order. We had the Hush puppies and the cast iron baked bread with chive butter for our beginning. They were both ok, nothing memorable. For our entr\u00e9e, we ordered scallops and the ginger salmon. Both were ok. I actually thought it was pretty weird that they both came in like a soup at the bottom and was surrounded by tons of vegetables. During the entire time we were eating, our waiter never showed up to ask if everything came out well or if we needed anything. We had to flag him down to bring us more water. The problem with that is that he still managed to go to the other tables in our section and asked how they were doing and even started sharing some information about his family. We could all hear his conversations. About 2 hours before we arrived, I called to ask if they could do something special for my friend because we were there to celebrate her.Someone came out with a plate that said congratulations and it had 3 miniature pastries. She said, \" I don't know what you guys are celebrating but congrats\". Our waiter also approached and made the same comment. Overall, the service was terrible and the food was just ok.

Meanwhile, the small drop biscuits came with a chive butter that enhanced the flavor of the fluffy biscuits.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered a single pancake. I didn't realize the pancake was the same lemon poppyseed pancake used in the entree version. I'm not much of a fan of lemon-flavored foods, but I barely picked up on any lemony notes, especially since there was no lemon buttercream in the entree version. However, the poppyseeds were much more present and added a subtle crunch to each bite. Overall, it was a delicious pancake, and sizable enough to be filling while still leaving room to sample some of the other menu items. Speaking of which, I tried both the stone-ground grits and the crisp new potatoes, both of which were amazing. The grits were probably the richest I've ever had -- they did not skimp on the butter. And the potatoes were just crispy enough with a delicious seasoning. All in all, I did not leave the table hungry. Everything was so good.\n\nThe service was spectacular -- everyone I interacted with from the host to our waiter was so friendly and attentive. The outdoor seating was lovely as well.

Good presentation. \n- Cheese ball #3, lavendar, pistachio, fig-honey& crisp: I wondered what cheese ball #2 and cheese ball #1 tasted like. The lavendar is an amazing finishing flavor touch to this appetizer, like a fragrant finishing perfume on your palate after the goat cheese melts. The fig-honey is well grouped into a jam texture so while it's not conducive to teaching a child about what a fig looks like, it's pretty tasty. **TIPS** you can get extra crisps. We asked for more bc we had more cheese and fig-honey than the crisps.\n- Ricotta Ravioli: I can't believe it's carrot sauce!!! How?!?! The ricotta filling is superb. The restaurant did not skimp out on the quantity of the ricotta. The basil is lightly oven roasted and will give you a new appreciation for the potential of basil + fennel. \n- Cheddar Black Pepper Waffle: I might have hyped this dish in my mind so I was faced with slight disappointment. The cayenne-cinnamon pecan sounded good on the menu but tasted like a disappointing bore on my palate. Maples apples were nice but overly sweet. The delicate flavor balance I had imsgined was off. Would not get it again.\n\nVIBE:\n- Very modern and inviting \n- I saw families, babies, girlfriends. So appropriate for all age groups.\n- Our waiter is super sweet and young.

Since The Love opened in November, however, I have visited twice--and this despite now living 25 miles away.  This has been the right choice.\n\nI first visited The Love on a cold Friday evening in December, less than a month after it first opened its doors.  The place was jam packed.  After circling the bar area like hawks for well over half an hour, my friend and I finally managed to swoop in on two seats positioned front and center facing the beautiful bar space.  From there, we enjoyed an absolutely delicious dinner of two different fish dishes and a few glasses of wine.  The service was good, but we were ever so slightly bothered when a group of women seated near us were given what was obviously a complimentary dish.  Presumably there was some backstory, but it's a mildly awkward thing to do around an intimate bar.\n\nMost recently, I visited The Love on Sunday for a double date birthday brunch.  The restaurant's dining area during the daytime was almost as lovely as its bar area at night, and our party of four did not have any problem grabbing a 1 p.m. reservation only a few days ahead of time.  The ladies both ordered shrimp and grits and the gentlemen both ordered the turkey BLT, and all of us licked our plates clean.  Again, service was on point, and we appreciated the birthday caramels that finished our meal.\n\nThe menu is creative, the food is excellent, and the atmosphere finally lives up to its ideal corner space a block from Rittenhouse Square.

It had a lot of goat cheese and there weren't a lot of great accompaniments like honey, sauces, etc.  \n\nPurist Poke: This is was probably the most unique and delicate dish of the night.  Great flavors from the salmon with the delicious hawaiian salt and avocado.  Great combination of flavors.\n\nParker House Rolls: I know it's \"healthyfied\" since they're whole wheat, but they are just not indulgent like regular Parker House rolls.  It's not buttery and creamy with a hint of sweetness and salt.  The chive butter is very delicious.  \n\nBrisket Pappardelle:  Great, fresh pasta.  Savory brisket.  The dish is just a bit one note.  No crunch, no sweet, no acid.  Just savory.  It was good, but not great.\n\nSalmon dish: My dinner guest got that dish.  Great crispy skin, but again, nothing amazing.\n\nCast Iron Cake: I never had rhubarb before and it sounded good.  It was good.  I do not enjoy really strong ginger flavor, so the ice cream wasn't for me."

This is the holiday season on a plate. Delicately sweet, a touch boozy, and most of all comforting. The rich bread pudding was warmed to just the right temperature and contrasted well against the cold eggnog ice cream. Then there was the crunchy pecans and rum caramel sauce, which had me scraping the plate for every last morsel. I only wish there was more to eat. The portion size was a little small for me, but I admittedly have a huge appetite. Highly recommend."

It comes out with a lively pink hue that some in our party found odd but it was silky, creamy and delicious. Next we had the sashimi plate which was some of the most fresh fish I've ever tasted. Fried oysters- the oysters are huge! Breading is well seasoned and coats the oysters well. Super moist and juicy. Cheese plate had a wonderful assortment of cheeses that ranged from semi soft to hard and creamy to blue. Nice variety.\nMain:\nThe ribs were phenomenal and saucy. This is definitely a dish to be eaten with fingers lol! \nDessert:\nDessert was their take of a banana foster that you pour or dip the sauce in and it is rich and heavenly. A perfect way to end the night.\n\nY'all might think I skipped on the scallops. Out of everything that was impressive the scallops were a big letdown. Maybe the chef messed up but they were the saltiest scallops I've ever had almost to the point of it being inedible. Maybe it was an off night for the cook but had it not been for these scallops the experience would have been 5 stars."

We ordered drinks and I didn't like it but the appetizers were delicious.   The cheese board was to die for but they forgot the blueberries....which I love.   Dinner was good.  I wish they had vegan options for my husband but I loved my collard greens.  However the pork chop was fatty and pink inside.   I brought it home and cooked it a little more for Sunday dinner.\nBut here is why I gave it one star...  we left around 945p,they close at 10.    Halfway up the turnpike,my husband realized he left his hat at the table.  I called the next morning and after two calls, the last one being with Hannah, no one could locate it.  It's disappointing that employees would steal a customers hat.   I wouldn't care much but it had sentimental value to him.   I'm disappointed in the response to my inquiry, right down to the fact that no one cared nor did the even call me back."

So when we arrived after making reservations, I was surprised to learn that The Love \"has never participated in restaurant week.\" The service is one of the reasons why I'm removing a star. The person who answered our question was rather rude and curt. We also requested shared plates and had to ask twice after our initial appetizer arrived (we got bread so there was a point where we were awkwardly eating on our napkins). I usually wouldn't mind these things but our reservation was at 4:30, when it wasn't very busy. \nThe food and drinks were delicious and live up to The Love's reputation. We got the bread pan with chives butter, miso salmon with banh mi veggies, and potato fries to share between the both of us. The flavors and textures worked well together and we were overall impressed by the variety given that The Love is American food. We also felt adequately full at the end of our meals. \nFor drinks, if you're a mimosa fan, I would recommend the Dreamweaver-- or just a plain mimosa since the latter is basically a more expensive mimosa."

And I'm giving a 3 Star review because of the experience we had more so than the quality of the food which was delicious!! Unfortunately as a table of two sharing a moment, we got shoved into an upstairs room with two large ROWDY & LOUD parties. Honestly it totalllllly killed the ambiance and celebratory aspect of our dinner. We loved the food but were dying to get out of there by the end.\n\nI found our waitresses were very helpful, gave us advice on the menu and were just the right amount of attentive. \n\nThe foood tho, amazing. I had a gin limoncello drink which knocked my socks off, strong but so yummy. Started with the crispy duck salad, topped with pears and ginger dressing - I am never a salad gal but I literally could've ordered another round and had it as an entree.... portions are decent sized, too, so that's saying something. My bf had mushroom sourdough toast that he's still talking about bc of how savory it was. He had ribs that I didn't manage to try but I know he enjoyed. I also tried the lobster spaghetti - this was generously topped with lobster in a buttery sauce that was just a bit too rich after other apps (likely my own downfall) \n\nI would consider coming back bc of the food but I'm skeptical of having the vibe of another celebratory evening ruined."

Although not a small restaurant it has a very nice and cozy feel that's appropriate given the name. Lunch started with a kettle chips and cheese fondue appetizer. The chips were your average potato chips. The fondue was excellent. I was glad there was enough fondue left over to go with the chips that came with my prime rib sandwich. The sandwich was just the kind of messy juicy deliciousness that I love,  on a perfect challah bun. Dessert was called a pumpkin head, which is described as a \"blondie sundae, pumpkin scoop, salted caramel & pumpkin seeds\". It was a sweet and tasty ending, perfect for this time of year. Since I was on vacation, I could actually order cocktails for lunch. I had a bourbon drink that was good enough to get me to order a 2nd. And The Love uses the \"good ice\" that melts really slow so you can take your time drinking without the drink becoming watered down.\n\nStephen Starr has done it again, with another memorable addition to Philly's restaurant scene. When I come back for dinner I wouldn't be surprised if The Love moved up to a 5 star restaurant."

It was a gorgeous morning, so I decided to sit outside. It was just before 11am, so seating was readily available but towards the end of my meal it was definitely starting to fill up. I'd recommend a reservation just to play it safe! Service was prompt and sincere. I ordered the cinnamon bun scones and the berries & yogurt, with an orange juice. Every single bite was heavenly. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes. As for dinner, they have a lovely wine list. The cheeseboard is thorough, many different kinds to enjoy and they even give you a paper to be able to keep track of what's what. I definitely appreciated that. Each time I've been for dinner I've gotten the black kale risotto, that's how good it is. I'm going to try to order a new dish next time, but it's just so freaking delicious. I crave it.

        "text": "There wasn't much for me to love about my experience at The Love :/ \n\nCame here for brunch on March 10th, 2019. Made reservations, showed up late (that's our fault but I didn't care frankly), and were offered to be seated at the bar since there were no tables available. Perfect! I prefer the bar anyway. \n\nHowever, after being seated, dining at the Love soon became lackluster and made me question the numerous reviews applauding the restaurant. \n\nOnce we sat down, a pair of older gentlemen sat near us shortly after and wondered if they were able to grab a table and decided to ask the host. They were promptly seated at a table right after. I find that off-putting that there was no offer to grab drinks at the bar and be moved to a table or be told that the wait would be under fifteen minutes. I just assumed the host knew what was best and would keep me informed. I assumed wrong. \n\nThe subpar service didn't stop there. I understand, as someone who works in a restaurant, that it can be hard to be on top of taking guests' orders or being attentive 24/7 but we found the service here to be extremely inattentive and almost off putting. \n\nGetting our order took way too long and also the bartender seemed to be all over the place which made me feel bad sitting at the bar. I felt almost rushed to eat so I could leave and the service felt neglectful.\n\nWe had ordered before a couple beside us and they somehow, with three more items than us, got their food before us. Yes, I know that the blame isn't on one singular person, but it's an observation I noted. \n\nSpeaking of food.... The brunch menu looked incredible and my date and I settled on the frittata, the chicken and waffles, and the cheese ball. We also ordered two Bloody Mary's and I was feeling risky and also ordered kombucha. \n\nUpon receiving the food, I realized I had made a huge mistake. I love chicken and waffles. I did not enjoy the chicken and waffles at the Love. For $24, it was not worth it whatsoever. I could have probably bought two better tasting entrees at Green Eggs Cafe with the money spent on a very underwhelming meal. The waffles didn't stand out in any way and the chicken needs something... I don't know what but it doesn't have any sort of identity and it should get one. \n\nI think my date liked his frittata but he didn't seemed amazed by it. The cheese ball was really good though. Wasn't amazed but would definitely order again if I came back. \n\nTake what you will the fact that a cheese ball tasted better than a brunch entree that I rank as one of my top 5 favorite meals. \n\nOther things to note: \n\n* Really beautiful restaurant! Would be great to take family visiting here or perhaps a night with someone special ;)\n* The bar chairs were very cool looking but extremely uncomfortable and so I really recommend making reservations and not banking on enjoying your time at the bar. \n* Perusing through the wine list, I noticed that some familiar wines that, say, typically sold for $9 a glass (for example, the Giesen) were $13 a glass here. I'm sure people who dine at the Love may not care about that but it's something to note. \n\nOverall, for how much we paid, the money definitely could have been spent better at another restaurant in the city due to the food and service. Perhaps dinner is better? I'm sure someone will try both the brunch and dinner and can write about it but it won't be me anytime soon. There is a lot to be desired but hopefully they get better in the future. The most lackluster of the Stephen Starr restaurants. If you have Starr gift cards, go elsewhere."

The Love is so homey and romantic I can't wait to go back.\n\nI made reservations on OpenTable for 6:30 for my birthday with my parents and hubby. We were seated right away and my table request was fulfilled as well. Our waiter was prompt and everything you would expect for a Steven Starr Resteraunt. The space is fairly small. I believe I read there are only one hundred seats available including the bar area. But the space definitely works. Although small it feels very open. The Love is filled with booths, half booths, and whicker chairs.\n\nLet's talk cocktails: \nThey had roughly nine cocktails on the menu and I probably could have drank any of them. I went with the Broken Arrow. A tequila drink w/ pear pur\u00e9e and agave. It was really great. Almost refreshing in a way that margaritas can lack. My husband went with 'A Very Good Bourbon Drink' he enjoyed as well. Definitely would like to try the 'A Mule With No Name' next visit. \n\nFor starters our table shared the mushroom toast and the farm salad. The mushroom toast was delish, but the real winner was the salad. Also was not expecting the salad to be as big as it was.. definitely shareable if you're not making it your entree! - I will say the only thing that jumped out to me on the \"A Real Meal\" list was the Proven\u00e7al Scallops. Other entrees ordered were the Maple Salmon and the Lovebird. My husband LOVED the LOVEbird but it was a heaping amount of soul food leaving him in a food coma. My scallops were perfect. Can't recommend them enough. I tried really hard not to order desert, but as soon as I saw they had a Dirt Sundae I folded. When deserts were brought out they also brought out a plate saying happy birthday with some small deserts. Very sweet! \n\nHighly recommend for a birthday and/or date night. Go for the cocktails and when in doubt always order desert."

A burger will run you about $18 so it's a bit more expensive. We went for lunch, the prices were a little more than other places but I'm assuming much cheaper than dinner. I would go back here."

        "text": "My fiance and I had a great time celebrating our 6 year anniversary at  The Love. We are not local to Philly; I found the restaurant on a whim while looking for places to dine in Rittenhouse Square. The Love seemed like an appropriate place to celebrate such an occasion!\n\nI made a reservation for a Saturday evening on Open Table a few weeks prior. When we arrived, we were (happily!) surprised to see how busy they were. The Love has a block long outdoor dining structure, with all tables partitioned and set up with heating devices. We checked in outside and were walked through the interior, which is so romantic and properly distanced. \n\nWe started off with drinks. My fiance got an espresso martini, and I had the Love Me Sweet with some vodka. This was a great light yet sweet drink, and I was able to nurse it all night!\n\nNext came a round of their famous parker rolls. These were next level delectable, especially the chive butter combo that the rolls come with. My ratio of bread to butter may have been overwhelmingly leaning on the butter, but you only live once, right?\n\nWe inhaled our entrees basically within seconds of them arriving to our table, they were that good. Their entree list is succinct but I don't really think you can go wrong with any choice. I had the Pulled Brisket Fazzoletti (garlic ricotta? yes please), and my fiance had the Lovebird. \n\nWhat made our night outstanding was our waiter. I unfortunately don't remember their name, but they were friendly, approachable, and knowledgable. They also surprised us at the end of the evening with a lovely dessert plate. It was so kind and made our experience even more memorable.\n\nI will definitely be here again! Thank you for a wonderful experience."

        "text": "I'll begin by saying  based on my visit I would be comfortable rating the restaurant a solid 3.5. \n\nIn all fairness I will say dining outside is not my thing, but the outdoor dining structure The Love built was much nicer than most. \n\nNow let's get to the meal ... I REALLY wanted the fried chicken but I'm trying to eat healthier so I order the Caesar salad, I've never had apples in a Caesar salad nor have I ever had a kale Caesar salad, it was just ok. My son ordered the brisket and he too was less than impressed with his dish, both dishes lacked seasoning . My husband had the fried chicken sandwich, it was 2 large spicy chicken breasts that were fried beautifully . My son and I sampled a piece of the fried chicken and immediately regretted ordering a salad and / or brisket. I will give The Love another try when I'm able to enjoy the indoor experience. I've also heard the brunch was pretty amazing so I am looking forward to trying that"

The ravioli itself was also delicious, and my only qualm about the dish is that I wish there was more ravioli. However, the Lovebird was not as good. We thought that the chicken was a bit dry; the breading was nice and you could tell it was real chicken, but we thought it was nothing special. As always with STARR restaurants, the service was great."

We went for brunch this past weekend and let me tell you that of all the brunch places I've been to, it's in the top 5! We started with hush puppies which were flavorful with the perfect hint of paprika. I had their take on \"chicken & waffles\" but instead of the waffles it was griddled brioche. It was so tender and juicy! There was a nice kick on the chicken and sauce. My BFF had the shrimp and grits and she said they used classic grits and it was super flavorful. Did I mention the portion sizes are huge! You definitely get your money's worth. We washed everything down with their signature mimosa drink, I believe it's called Dream Weaver... regardless it was refreshing. I look forward to going back to try their dinner menu. I would recommend making a reservation in advance with the current pandemic because the restaurant was packed! P.S for brunch each table has a 1 hour time limit."

The food was all delicious, although both of our egg dishes were a little cool when arriving at the table. We had the heirloom tomato salad, the mini biscuits, cheddar omelette and truffle scrambled eggs. Cocktails were quite good, too."

I ordered the ricotta ravioli which had a butternut squash sauce and brown butter vinaigrette, as well as some hazelnuts and chives on top.  The dish was delicious and everything paired well together, but for $25 I wish there was just a bit more pasta."

I'm so happy this restaurant opened close to home near Rittenhouse square and despite hearing reviews about the restaurant being quite expensive (and challenging to enter), we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirstly, the ambiance is great. We sat on a booth with old Edison lightbulbs hanging above our heads and a perfect view of the street. With time to spare (and hungry mouths to feed), we ordered many dishes including the buttered rolls, homecooked grits, paprika seasoned cucumber slices and pesto risotto dishes. They were all cooked superbly well and despite a hefty price tag, the serving sizes were quite fair. \n\nThis place is perfect for medium-sized groups looking to try high quality cuisine (from the infamous Philly chef) while expecting quick, friendly service and food to properly fill the belly. Service was well done without an ounce of anxiety awaiting our dishes. A+!"
