Chicken is just deep fried wings and drumsticks with no flavors. Waffles taste very dense and dry. The condensed milk is not enough at all. In all, the whole dish is very dry. It was also a long wait for food. My husband and I waited for around 40 mins to get our food."

The wait (wasn't terribly long) for the food was worth it. They have fun drinks, like the mimosa tower, which is huge enough to share between 4 people. Brunch was a great experience will be back for dinner."

While I do love getting my bang for my buck for drinks, all I could taste was straight dark liquor in every sip. The waitress kindly added more juice mix for me to make it a little more fruity for me! So appreciative of that. \n\nThe loaded tots hit the spot for us! I'm a huge fan of fusion food because of how flavorful it is and the loaded tots are the epitome of that! The cheese, meat, onions - literally everything in that appetizer was a beautiful blend of flavors in every bite! I highly recommend if you're a fan of your savory snacks!\n\nMy one and only complaint about this establishment is simply a side note: The parking situation is horrendous here! During happy hour especially -- the northern liberties area is a huge mix of establishments and residential townhouses so it's incredibly difficult to find parking during peak hours! I had to circle around the neighborhood for roughly 30 minutes before finding a spot!"

Everything was fine, we ordered our food, an iced tea & a single mojito to share (one of us was driving & we're super lightweight at that lol.) Initially, i ordered the chicken and waffles, but changed my mind to the breakfast tacos whereas my boyfriend ordered their burger. From here things get crappy:\n\n1. Mojito tasted virgin (emphasis again that we are lightweight, meaning with two sips one of us was going to be slightly red - asian glow baby ! But nope. It just tasted like club soda, mint and fruit flavoring) \n\n2. Boyfriends burger buns were burnt\n\n3. They gave me the chicken and waffles even though i told the waitress in the beginning i wanted the breakfast tacos instead . \n\n4. Both the chicken and waffles were BURNT and flavorless. \n\n5. Never got my iced tea.\n\nI didnt voice anything out because i was already so agitated with this first time experience. Maybe night staff has their system together opposed to their daytime/brunch staff because a lot of my friends talk big about this place & theyve only gone during the evening. Ill pass."

The brunch menu is awesome and you have the option for $15 plates! My favorite part is that you have the option for waffle fries, breakfast potatoes or tots.  Potato lovers rejoice! My only complaint was that there was no coffee or brunch cocktails, but I am sure that will change in the future. Looking forward to having dinner and drinks the next time we visit!"

The restaurant is located at the heart of Northern Liberties with both indoor and outdoor dining. They did a good job of separating tables with wall shield in between. Their brunch menu has a good amount of brunch classics as well as unique Asian, Mexican inspired dishes. They have quite an extensive drinks menu if you want to have a good time. The food were well presented and well portioned for the price. I ordered the SET STEAK & EGGS SKILLET which was Asian inspired and it was well seasoned and not too chewy. I also had their mango bellini which was a nice light drink for the afternoon.\n\n*VERDICT*\nYes, I would go back again. Want to try their champagne tower"

They have a cute set up for outside dining with little Fire pit type heating on the tables it was very cute. We however dined inside. They had each table spaced a good distance apart with plastic dividers which is good for covid safety precautions..KUDOS!!!!! The front end staff as well as our waitress Nadia was very nice and friendly. She helped with any questions we had, considering it was our first time dining and it was her first day. She did a great job! The atmosphere was chill with good music and cool scenery on the walls. We ordered our meals. We both got the Set 4 -bulgogi burger with home fries and the breakfast wonton appetizer! I also ordered a Mango frozen margarita. Both the meal and app were absolutely amazing!!! We highly recommend. My drink was delicious! They offer a mimosa tower. I WILL get that the next time. We had a good time chatting across the dividers with other couples and diners and had an enjoyable experience! I highly recommend checking this place out!"

Due to Covid, seatingbwas outside and the place was well lit.  The music was good but was coming from neighbor restaurant.\n\nWe started off with Jalepeno popper and Lichitini with loaded tator tots. The drinks were a bit watered down. Lichitini was good well flavored drink but Jalepeno popper was ice and Jalepenos. Our server recommended a side shot along with syrup that would help improve the taste. After the shot it was better. But shot was $10. A bit pricey. We ordered cheeky tiki and mango mojito. Again, it was like drinking fruit juice. So, having shots added helps. The mix match sliders were good. We did complaint to the server about the watered down drinks and looks like they were standard pours.  So, I recommend accounting for a side of shot. It was a bit surprising since these were they special drinks.\n\nOverall, we liked the food but drinks not so much."

They gave a margarita to a 14 year old which she drank thinking it was juice. Then at the end of the service while we were all trying to figure out the bill, someone from the restaurant who was not our server came up to the 14 year old in our group (not any of the 10 adults at the table) and said that we FAR exceeded the 90 minute limit, that I saw no signs for so it may not even exist and that another group had been waiting a long time and that we had to go. We dropped almost $800 to celebrate a graduation on shitty food and terrible service.

She would pass our table and wouldn't ask if we needed refills or another drink which would've been nice since the food took forever. It was not busy maybe 3 tables inside a few outside so we couldn't understand the delay. Apps took forever then I had to ask the server to take the empty plates and clear the table because she kept floating by with nothing to do. They bought out everything but one persons food, and then we had to flag down the server to remind her our friend still has not gotten his food. The food was cold and hash browns hard. Everything else food wise was basic nothing special about the menu. The margarita flight was nasty, 1 of out the four drinks on the flight was good, they tasted like fake sugar syrup and fake fruit flavors. Go elsewhere there is better food and service all over Philly."

After being seated and reviewing the menu for 10-15min, when it came time to order drinks, we were informed by our server that alcohol would not be served until 4pm. This information was not told to us upon making the reservation, is not on their website, and was not explained when we arrived, despite the alcoholic drink menus that were on display at the entrance of the establishment at our time of arrival. My second choice was a Thai iced tea. The waiter informed me that they were out of coffee and could not make the Thai iced tea. I did not realize coffee was needed for Thai iced tea as the usual ingredients are tea, milk, and sugar.  On to my 3rd choice, mint lemonade. When the glass arrived, you could see straight through the beverage as if it were purely water. The taste only validated the appearance, as this beverage tasted like water with hint of lemon squeezed in, in addition to a mint leaf or two. Did not stick around for food, but I can only imagine how disappointing that would have been. We were also asked for a card to \"hold\" for the tab and were told we would not be charged. Surprised! We were charged within minutes of handing over the card. Horrible experience. Do not come here. Would give 0 (or negative) stars if possible."

Our reservation was at 3:45 and the dinner menu was not available until 4:30. We were not allowed to wait for the dinner menu to be available because there is a 90 minute table time so our only option was brunch. \n\nWhile this was a tiny inconvenience, the service, food, and drinks made up for it. For drinks I shared a beer tower, and also ordered their Hot and Spicy which was a hot apple cider drink with cinnamon and whiskey. This was incredible. For my meal I ordered the Bulgogi Breakfast Burger. This was definitely something that I would order again if I came for brunch. Our service was incredible the whole time and constantly had staff circulation the restaurant to see if anyone needed anything. Overall, I would definitely come back here."

Let me start out by saying the entire tables comes from the industry, and we all try to be understanding of the circumstances that surround eating out during COVID.\n\nThe server was very sweet and we could tell he was trying his best. He disclosed this was his first shift (first time serving I think) so we knew to give him some leeway and we were fine with that as we had all been in his position before.\n\nWe got drinks in a timely fashion, which was good. However we were not approached again to order food for about 20 minutes. \n\nBeing quite hungry at that point we order apps (just 2) so we had something quickly and ordered our food at the same time since we had plenty of time to make those decisions.\n\nWe did grow concerned when we hadn't seen our apps after a half hour of waiting, but we figured the kitchen was busy and covid, etc. however we also had empty drinks and waters, and were not approached until we asked to order more drinks. \n\nAfter about an hour and 20 minutes I finally approached the host stand to kindly prod. I asked her if she could check on our food as it has been a really long time and the server had on stopped back once to say \"they're working on it I think\".\n\nThe food came out about 3 minutes after I approached the hostess. Appetizers came with the meal. Not sure if this was just a misunderstanding, but it was definitely disappointing and we had a pregnant friend at the table that was starting to eat her hands at this point. \n\nThe food was overall decent. I wouldn't rave and rant about it but it did the job. A big thing that bothered us is that a few of the dishes listed on the menu did not match what came out on our plates. There we quite a few but for instance, the avocado toast \"set\" lists the meal and 2 toasts with saut\u00e9ed cherry tomatoes, pickled onions, & balsamic vinaigrette. The set actually only came with 1 toast, mine had why I believe to be feta on it, some haphazardly cut tomatoes (not saut\u00e9ed), no onions, no vinaigrette, while my friend next to me who ordered the same thing had the onions on it. She was a little upset it did not come with two as described, and she also unfortunately cannot have cheese (she wishes!) so she did not eat her meal. She was not asked if she wanted something else.\n\nThe whole thing was just very messy. No consistency, mediocre food, and a long wait. They took off my friends avocado toast, and gave a 15% discount. (Don't worry, we made sure we didn't screw over the waiter) \n\nPlease work on consistency, timing, employee training and communication! If you told us there was a problem or kept us updated or made sure we had drinks or an appetizer to hold us over, things might have been better. There is a laundry list of things that could have improved or saved our experience that unfortunately just didn't happen. We will not return :("

I do like a lot of options in a menu(double knot is a prime example), however to have a small menu with really quality options makes it even more specials. We started with the chicken and waffles which are salt and pepper jalape\u00f1o chicken, waffles, whipped scallion garlic butter and condensed milk syrup. I didn't really taste the jalape\u00f1o factor in the chicken but it was still crispy and yummy. The waffles were sooo good, soft, fluffy and I loved the scallion garlic butter. My entree was steak and egg skillet. I got it with tater tots instead of the sriracha garlic home fries because my inner school girl cannot pass on tots. I always think of that scene from Napoleon Dynamite with the tater tots in his pocket. My friend got the breakfast tacos which is one of their four \"sets\". Tacos have sausage, eggs, bacon pieces, caramelized onions, tots and chipotle Mayo. They are loaded but hella good. We had to pack up food to go because the mimosa tower seriously conquered us. I recommend having at least 3 people, trust me even were hardcore badass and we were like full to capacity. I will tell you now it is hard to get a brunch reservation unless you go late in the afternoon. They do have happy hour too I really wanna try.

They set it up nicely with twinkle lights, and picnic tables so it's a casual chic vibe. All of the food was served on disposable cutlery and containers with the exception of our cocktails.\n\nCocktails:\nThey have a thorough drink menu with 16 and 32 oz options. The drinks are delicious and appropriately strong; however, If you want to add a \"shooter\" you can for just an addition $4. There are mixed drinks and frozen drinks and the menu clearly lays everything out for you. The drinks were so fun! They were served in a plastic red travel container with a bindy straw- it made me feel like I was on a vacation which was definitely needed! got the frozen pi\u00f1a colada which was so deliciously refreshing. \n\nFood:\nSo I immediately went to the taco section! Being a pescatarian I had two options, the fish or shrimp tacos. The great thing about the menu is you can mix your selections so you can try any three combinations for $14. I did two shrimp and one fish. The fish was good but the shrimp...incredible!! The flavor, the light crispiness, the size. The portions were fantastic because it wasn't too much food but it wasn't small by any means. I tried the classic tater tots and they were exactly what you would expect for tater tots- nothing necasarily stood out about them. For meat eaters- I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend tried the Cheese steak buns and I didn't even think he chewed he said they were mouth watering good! \n\nService: \nWas amazing. Our server was super attentive and patient walking us through the menu.\n\nOverall I loved it and would definitely recommend for a chill night where you want to eat well and have a fun time! \n\nEnjoy!!"

We arrived around 7:10 pm. Had a reservation for 7:30 pm. The server's name is Maria H. The server stated she didn't like my tone and I was attacking her because I asked for an update on the food and asked for the manager... never yelled... Never raised my voice. Simply asked... she proceeds to say it's not her fault all of her tables are waiting and that she can't get me a manager. She also asked what would I tell the manager multiple times that I just gave up. Totally unacceptable. From the time we came recognized all the tables in her area were receiving lack of service or waiting on her. But ok, we give it a chance. She not only blamed the kitchen and her manager but said she has other tables still waiting on their food as if that's ok...\nOne table that was in her area that also walked out after their meal were saying \"I'll be writing a review on Yelp\"... smh.\nThey have a little sign on the table that states there is a 20% gratuity and they pre-authorize the card for \"outdoor seating\" after we order. She came back at like 10 mins after to ask to pre-authorize the card... we're sitting inside. There are no signs stating this. Seems like this is their method to make up for their horrible service. Pre charge the card and 20% gratuity regardless... this place is not recommended because customer service is everything and it's a turn off to hear her react the way she did to me and blame everyone else instead of a solution."

After looking at their website, instagram, and yelp photos, I was so excited to try SET NoLibs, but I was sadly disappointed. The cocktails were average. For food, we ordered the SET #2 House Speciality, charbroiled oysters, tempura shrimp tacos, and Set Loaded Tots. When the food came out, it looked and smelled so amazing, but the taste was underwhelming and the more we ate everything, the less we liked it. The chicken skewer was very dry and lacked flavor. Their pork belly slider had this metallic taste to it and a very weird aftertaste. The charbroiled oysters and tempura shrimp tacos also lacked flavor. \n\nI did like the Set Loaded Tots, but after a while it did get old and some bites tasted better than others. The best part of the meal and only thing I'd recommend is the waffle fries with the chipotle aioli.   \n\nThe menu is a bit on the pricier side (and because of my experience I'd say it's very overpriced) but pretty average for restaurants in the Northern Liberties area. In terms of atmosphere, outdoor dining, and service, I was happy. The outdoor seating is a nice set-up and from the photos I've seen of the inside dining, it also looks super cute. The picnic tables are dog-friendly (we were even given a water bowl for our pup) and pretty spacious. I believe our server was Desiree and she was so sweet. \n\nProbably wouldn't return for dinner, but my sister said she really enjoyed their brunch items so maybe I'll go back to try that!"

The outdoor seating is picnic table style and veryyy slanted. I was very concerned drinks were gonna be spilled multiple times. The table we were given was on the side walk. The tables in the street area didn't look as bad but we were told they were all reserved. \n\nOnce we were able to get moved inside we felt comfortable to order the mimosa tower. This wasn't what I was expecting but it ended up being my favorite thing. It's a huge tube of mimosas with a tap at the bottom for you to fill your own glasses. We were told it held 2 whole bottles of champagne. The mimosas were amazing, strong, and not to much OJ. \n\nNow for the food - this is where we were disappointed. It's called sets so you have to order a set, right? I got set #3 (tacos) and both my friends got set #4 (burger). And for our sides we were very excited about them siracha home fries. We even ordered an extra for the table but these were actually the worst part of the meal and barely touched. They could have used wayyy more siracha. They weren't crispy at all. They were just bland boiled potatoes. Not what we were expecting. As for our mains. The tacos were standard. Nothing to rave about but nothing to really complain about either. The burgers however weren't as good. They were soggy. So soggy that my friends had to resort to eating them with a fork. \n\nOverall I probably would only come back to get drinks unless they revamped the menu."

Most of the appetizers were ok and needed work to get it to the taste they need to be. Our favorites were the Jalape\u00f1o cheeseburger spring rolls and the tempura shrimp poppers. The charbroiled oysters were dry and burnt ( they need to pay special attention to details). We ordered loaded tots and the waitress did not tell us they didn't have tots and brought us French fries that we sent back and they did not charge us. The mojito did not taste like one and was very strong and bitter( must pay attention to recipe) don't make drinks too strong. Their sliders were also ok. Bahn mi buttered steak sliders needed more flavor and the meat more caramelization flavor to it. Sesame chicken sliders were not at all sesame chicken. Their batter needs work to make it more tasty.  No sesame flavor and could use some sweet and sour sauce to it for added flavor. One of our favorites were the soy glazed pork belly Skewer which was tasty but the Vietnamese buttered steak cubes and lemongrass chicken were not the taste of Vietnam. I would suggest to go to a Vietnamese restaurant and learn the spices of Vietnam and redo these dishes to taste like Vietnamese cuisine. The atmosphere was nice with heaters to keep us warm outside which was an added touch. The service was acceptable but hoped for better service because not a lot of people there. We had to ask for water and it took a while to get it. Also we made reservations at 3pm and our food didn't come until 4:10. Be prepared to wait some time. You can't be in a hurry to eat here.

The outdoor seating is curbside picnic tables/benches separated by dividers. Not the cutest but it gets the job done. \n\nDrinkssss. Most of you are here for the margarita tower and want to know if it's worth the $69. Yes. Three of us split one tower and got 3 flavors on the side ($2 each). It's filled with so much ice that it looks like it's going to be watery but don't fret it's strong. Literally we were all shocked at how good the margaritas were. \n\nThe food. We ordered a variety of wings so forgive me because I don't remember which ones but what I will say is they were all really good. We also ordered tacos & the tempura shrimp were my fav! \n\nThe bathroom- It could be looked after better. It's not that appealing to the eye so don't think you're getting any cute selfies. \n\nThe service was amazing. Our server was really nice and friendly. \n\nSet NoLibs is going to be in my summer rotation heavily."

She replied with \"I don't know.\" Okay, not every person will know all the ingredients in the dish so I asked very politely, \"Okay, can you ask the kitchen?\"  And she replied with a blatant and attitude \"No.\" That, right there, just shows you everything you need to know about the place. She refused because it would be more effort for her. I should've gotten up from the table and walked out. I've never in my entire life experienced something like that. Complete carelessness about a customers allergy/concern. \n\nMajority of the staff walk around with half mask on and mask off whenever they feel like it. The staff do no care at all as apparently it's a MANDATORY 20% Tip already included in your check. This is obscene as I definitely don't think my waitress deserved the tip at all. \n\nThe food itself was decent, but this place is very much overvalued and overhyped. This attracts college bar people, and they treat it like so.\n\nThe staff even let someone vape inside and didn't say anything at all to them. (Yes, the staff knew, looked directly at them too) What about my asthma? Just wow on so many levels. If I could give this place a 0 star rating I would've!"

Never had Vietnamese food, Korean food, Lemon Grass, or Vegetarian food, and really wasn't in the mood to try it for the first time at the moment. If you like that type of food, this is the place for you. It is a very young crowd vibe in the spot. You have on option of inside, and outside dining. They ask for your credit, or debit card to place on file before you place your order. Apparently people have been walking away without paying for their order. The staff is friendly, and explained the menu. They have a Magarita Flight Tower of a set of 4 for $29. You can choose for flavors. I don't think it's worth it though. The drinks were average at best. I didn't like the Sesame Chicken Wings. The Shrimp Skewers, and the Cajun Garlic Butter Wings were the best thing I ordered, and they were appetizers."

        "text": "So what I was NOT expecting on a lovely Mother's day of taking our moms and wives out was to experience one of the best burgers I've ever had. First of all, Set NoLibs is an interesting name, but at least the outside seating was swanky with a table fire pit encased in glass. Only hard part was passing food and hoping the person grabbe the plate fast enough so you don't burn yourself lol Be careful! \n\nThe oakwood benches looked cool, but most of our butts were hurting after a short while and our feet were getting numb. Random, I know. The no touch menu made things easy to order and I took the safe route with a burger which was a 30-day dry-aged beef burger with a fried egg and garlic aioli sauce. The burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. Not too salty, or greasy at all. The egg was perfectly cooked.\n\nMy fave part of the burger was that brioche bun and garlic aioli. The garlic was stronger than I expected which was a great thing to me. The waffles fries that came with the burger were amazing as well! It was enough food to fill me up half the day. MY sister didn't like her tater tots and tried to steal some of my waffles fries. She's lucky I love her, so I gave her 2 fries lol"

Upon tasting my spouse and I smelled the chicken l. It had an awful smell. I then let the server know because our waited barely checked on us. They server agreed that it had a weird odor and took it back. However the manager argued wit me for 5 minutes stating that the chicken came in that day! And I would pay for the two remaining skewers!! Of course I was unsatisfied and wanted to be refunded for all the skewers which I didn't eat due to the file taste!! Eventually he wound up taking it off my bill without an apology or anything!! Because of this I will never return!!!! Horrible ass hole manger"

They almost took me back to New Orleans. The bulto go tacos were good and filling. Lots of different flavors there. I'd have like more of a crisp on the steak. The chocolate mousse cake surprised me but was pretty good."

        "text": "This was our first visit here and the dining experience was horrible , had an reservation which the greeters were great   We had  drinks at the bar until our booth  became available. Order has been placed with bartender she was nice  so that was a plus , however a \"well\" done burger was ordered and it was not received . Never saw the server  but once and that was because I yelled and flagged him down smh , in his past time he was behind the wall on his phone, not even checking on his tables . I kindly let him know this up front . What I originally came out to eat was not available until dinner time which was a bummer . So I had to settle for something else which I didn't really. The server came to correct  the situation and we were hold it would be no charge doe the mistake and still wind up paying for it. Maybe we will return at a later date & time after 4 pm so I can try the shrimp  tacos,  but for a 1pm date it shouldn't have been so negligent . Very bad first time experience"

From the minute we got there and i said my name for the reservation, the staff was rude. The food truly sucked and was majorly overpriced. My server told me what i had ordered wasnt on the menu and when i showed her on my phone, there was huge attitude and it wasnt comped even though the item came out after everyone else had finished their meals. Who does chicken and waffles with wings?! The waffles had congealed syrup on them like they had been sitting out. Bloody mary was all watery and didnt even seem like there was alcohol in it. Mimosa tower was cool but not worth $69. Dont waste your $ at this place!"

        "text": "Even if this was the only place open for food ever again, I would NEVER return here. I waited a day to post my review so I could mull over the meal and service and still can't find anything to brag about here. They charged $4 for my friend's tea and it was Lipton brand. Such a rip off on pricing. I ended up going to the Starbucks next door for a coffee instead. I have to say, I was surprised at how small the brunch menu was and how pricey these items were. I ordered the hangover tots because I wanted to try the SPAM in it. A few of us ordered drinks, and enjoyed conversing outside at our table. The food finally came and almost all of the meals were incorrect. One person in our party can't have gluten, and asked for her meal without ketchup or avocado and had to send hers back because it came with both on it. I asked for mine without ketchup and saw it was served on top. My scrambled egg on the hangover tots was like rubber. The ketchup, aioli and other toppings didn't mix well at all. I was expecting a ground sausage, but was surprised it was sliced. On top of that, no SPAM. I was going to ask for a replacement, but didn't want to wait for it as the original meals took some time to arrive and I had to be somewhere soon. Honestly glad I didn't wait, because the replacement meal we ordered for our gluten free friend didn't arrive until after the checks were paid. The hangover tots meal really was nothing to rave about for $15. Our appetizers never came. The waitress for our table barely checked on us. We had to kindly ask another waitress for the check because we hadn't seen ours in about 10-15 minutes and she said she would just be taking over our table for the rest of our meal.  It just seemed like they weren't on top of their game. When we got the check, we were charged for a bottomless mimosa (which someone did order) AND a bottle of champagne. We asked to have that fixed, and she removed the bottomless mimosa order, but kept the champagne bottle on (which was more expensive, mind you). She had already charged my card for this, and I was so frustrated, so I didn't ask for a refund. The ONLY redeeming thing was that our friend said her gluten free meal, that came out as we were getting up to leave, was delicious. So, brownie points I guess? It's also kind of terrible that a 20% tip was automatically added. Had the service been top notch, this would have been deserved...but it's like they could have cared less about us because they knew it was going to be added anyhow. Looking forward to never coming back and making sure none of my friends do if they're in Philly."
