        "text": "Great Mexican BYOB! I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. \n\nI'm surprised this place doesn't have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... \n\nThe guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entr\u00e9e had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. \n\nI should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can't eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  \n\nThe prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they're a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don't come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!"

And it was delicious, as was every part of my order.\n\nWhy the two stars?  As it seems others know all too well, the service was abysmal.  On one occasion, we waited interminably for a table, only to find out that the waiter thought we were part of another party, when there had been two seats available the whole time!  \n\nOnce we were served, the waitstaff ignored us.\n\nThis place seriously needs a management shakeup.  It needs a better manager, and a dedicated hostess/outside manager."

        "text": "I tried Las Cazuelas recently, after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren't filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.\n\nI decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.\n\nI will not be going back.  I have had MUCH better Mexican off of the trucks in South Philly."

The Horchata and Mexican Coffee are excellent drinks. It gets major points for being BYOB. The meats are so tender and the rice is perfectly cooked. The main reason for the perfect five stars is what topped the whole experience for me: the dessert. THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER EATEN. EVER. You MUST order the Cheesecake Bunuelos!!! It will blow your mind. I will forever be returning to Las Cazuelas."

Medium sized restaurant with two separate dining areas, good for large groups as you can reserve the entire back room.\n\nThe service is fantastic, even when we've shown up 20 minutes prior to closing time, the wait staff was still incredibly hospitable.  The margaritas they mix are great, which is saying something as I typically don't enjoy margaritas.  The food is delicious, and parking is very easy in the area.  If you find yourself in Northern Liberties, give it a try!  They frequently run specials on Groupon and Living Social, so keep your eyes open and save a few bucks!"

        "text": "I used to live a few doors down from Las Cazuelas in 2005 and went there faithfully because the food is DELICIOUS! I dont' know if they still make it, but the Chilean sea bass with pumpkin mole was one of the tastiest things I've ever eaten. \nMy husband and I visited last Sunday for Brunch and we ordered a TON of food because we had a $50 gift certificate to use up. I can highly reccommend the Huevos Divorciados and the Omlette Poblano. I am a poblano and mushroom lover and the oaxaca cheese melts into the eggs and veggies in the most wonderful way. My husband had the Divorciados and it was both unusual and tasty! \nMy favorite at Las Cazuelas are the tacos- the steak with fresh onions and cilantro is by far the winner in my book and I confess, I have dreamed of them and often cannot resist the urge to go get a big plate of them! We tried the marinated steak tacos this time and did not like them very much- there was a red coating of marinade on the steak and it was overwhelming. You could not taste the yummy, meat-y, grilled flavor that is so great in the regular steak tacos. My husband loved the shredded pork tacos and I thought they were ok. The shrimp tacos are always a winner and taste fresh, crisp and light. I suppose it is the pure flavors and how they usually treat the fresh ingredients that brings me back time and again, I will veer away from the overly marinated items in the future. As always, the cafe de Olla (coffee with cinnamon +) and desserts are very good. I tell everyone about this place and always bring it up as an option when we have folks in from out of town. Keep up the great work!!"

The empanadas and fish tacos were to die for. We also got shrimp quesadillas. Service was great! Initially they brought out the wrong type of quesadillas, and gave us the shrimp ones on the house.

It's just a little bit out of the way, so though I really enjoyed it many years ago when it first opened, I had not been until I saw a Living Social deal for a gift certificate and decided to try it again. \n\nAm glad I did! The sauces are well made and use a variety of great chiles for this-is-definitely-not-from-a-jar-like-other-\"mexican\"-restaurants quality. I ended up having the empanaditas and a great cactus salad and was really impressed with the range of flavors. They have a wide ranging menu and several great sounding specials. \n\nWe also lucked out because the people next to us had thoughtfully brought more tequila than they needed and let us have a few glasses of the BYOT margaritas. The mixes were fresh and flavorful and they will mix the tequila in for you. \n\nOur only complaint was because it was so small, every margarita order meant we had to be very near a loud blender, but that's a small price to pay for excellent food, friendly service, and a lovely little restaurant."

        "text": "So I love spicy food.  At most places,  I load on the hot sauce.  So I assumed when I got the arroz con pollo with chicken, rice, and mexican sauage (which was delicious) that it wouldn't be spicy enough.  I so stupidly didn't even taste it and asked for some hot sauce, which they brought me in a dish.  It looked like Franks Red Hot, so I dumped it on.  Big mistake.  The hot sauce was SO SPICY (which unbeknownst to me, they charged me $1 for).  It was so hot that I downed 5 glasses of water, had tears in my eyes, and couldn't finish the rest of my meal.  On the plus side, I was stuffed from water and hence, didn't overeat!\n\nThe service here is really fantastic.  The server was so friendly and kept our water glasses filled.  We had a groupon ($15 for $30) and although it didn't say it on the groupon, the server told us that it came with a free dessert!  We got the crepes with bananas, caramel, and fresh berries which was tasty.   You also get free chips and tomatillo sauce, which was great.  The place is BYO, takes credit cards, and they offer different margarita mixes w/ your booze.  They have a private room upstairs which is great to reserve for large groups."

The Mexican corn was very flavorful and not too spicy, which I really appreciated.\n\nThe table came with complimentary chips and salsa which was very light and appropriate before starting the meal. A nice touch. Chips could've been more salty but overall everything was still fine as the salsa gave good flavor.\n\nI ordered the enchiladas which were a bit too bean-y for my taste. \n\nGreat service and nice, clean atmosphere.

        "text": "This is my longest review because the service was pretty terrible so I have a lot to say. \n\nMy boyfriend and I had bought a Groupon for this place in efforts to try something new for our anniversary dinner. This place is cute, small and intimate. We were greeted by a women in a T-shirt which I thought was odd because she was dressed if she was working in a pizza shop and not a restaurant. She sat us down at the table and went over to the computer and tinkered around with it. We assumed she was just the hostess and not the waitress. As we waited for someone to take our drink order, It was enough time that we  read the entire menu thoroughly twice. When we figured out what we wanted the women in the T-shirt was still at the computer  and no one took our drink order yet.  My boyfriend then got up and asked if she was the waitress and she nodded her head yes, so he told her we are ready to order when she was. She then took another several minutes before walking over  with some chips. \nWe both have a gluten allergy and my boyfriend has a vegetable oil allergy. We asked the waitress if the chips were cooked on vegetable oil and explained my boyfriend was allergic. She said she didn't know and just stared at us. My boyfriend then politely asked if she could go check. She informed us are cooked in vegetable oil so of course he didn't eat them. We ordered a chicken fajita and a chicken quesadilla. The menu said have a choice of corn or flour for both items and we asked for corn. Our waitress was very confused as to why I was specifying corn tortillas because she said \"we only have corn tortillas not the flour ones\" I wasn't going to argue because I wanted corn. (At this point she still didn't take out drink order) She placed the order and returned and tell us everything is cooked in vegetable oil... So I asked her if we should leave or do you have any other substitute for vegetable oil and of course she said \"I don't know\" and stared at us. Again, my boyfriend had to asked her to go check for us. At this point I imagine the owner or manager got involved. He said he would cook everything in Olive Oil, and let me tell you the food was delicious! We were pleasantly surprised after the huge headache of being there. After the food came out we still had nothing to drink so we asked the manager if we could get some water and we ate. I can't say enough about how good that Mexican food was!  I got the check and the bill was $30.25 which was perfect because our Groupon was $30 and our card could be charged .25 so we could tip the waitress. (I always tip regardless of the service, some people have bad days) The check came back of wrong, not surprised and she took $25 off our bill so I showed her it's $30 not $25 so I hand her the bill to adjust it and my card to charge me the .25 difference.  She comes back the bill saying it was now $28 and we had no bill after the Groupon. I explained I only had my card and I wanted to tip her even if she did run my card for .25. She stared at us and said \"uhhh, I don't know\" My boyfriend said hey if you can work it out we will tip you but she said not worry about it. I did feel bad but my boyfriend even said, she made the decision on not taking a tip.\nPros- Great environment \n             Great food \n             BYOB \n             Accommodating to food allergies if you asked someone other then the waitress \n\nCons - THE SERVICE. It was enough to not go back unless the manager agreed to let me take own order and personally give it took the cooks. Also help ourselves to some water...because the waitress won't. It's a shame because the food has been amongst the best. It could have been our new favorite place."

Well, Las Cazuelas has has converted her.\n\nWe sat outside on a breezy evening.  We were promptly greeted and our wine (BYOB) was iced down.  The server gave us the specials and was very attentive.\n\nThey serve extra crispy chips w/  salsa verde w/ just the right amount of spice.   We got 4 appetizers and could not even finish!!  Seriously, the Queso Fundido may have been one of the best things I've tasted.  A buttery ball of Mexican cheese w. mushrooms inplanted throughout.  We ate it like a pasta, twirling it around a fork.  Overly simple, but so right.  Quesdillas w/ chicken served w/ pico de gallo were perfection, beef tacos served w/ lime & salsa verde were delicious.  Tres Marias were the low point of the meal.  Corn patties w/ black beans topped w/ chipotle chicken and ground beef were a bit bland and soggy, but I ate the shit out of the toppings.\n\nWe ended the meal w/ a Tres Leches that was extra moist and not too sweet, one of my favorite desserts in any food genre.\n\nTo top it off, we had a $30 Living Social voucher, 4 apps and dessert came to $11 before tip.  There is no reason NOT TO GO HERE PEOPLE.\n\nI'd say 4.5 stars."

I tasted one to make sure my assumption was correct.  I told the waitress and she gave me the excuse that, \"that is the way they are supposed to smell and taste b/c the ricotta chz they use is not American.\"  WTF?  The waitress took the barely touched app away.  I get the bill and they are still on the check.  I called her over to ask to have them removed and she says,\"The owner says you ate them\".  Now I'm a straight up person...if I ate em, I will pay for it.  She delivers the newly edited check back to me with an attitude.  THAT will affect your tip, chica!!\nOn the plus side, the CHULETA NORTENA (pork chop) was juicy and flavorful.  Accompanied by the slightly sweet and creamy sweet potato.

        "text": "So, we have been here three times now, and each time I have been SO pleased with our meal.  Finally getting around to writing a review... sorry it is long, but I know I find reviews with specific recommendations helpful, so read on if you would like to hear them!  If not, then here's the short review: GO HERE!\n\nFirst of all, as a vegetarian, the dishes are rather expensive (more expensive than the meat dishes, which is odd).  However, they are DELICIOUS... well-seasoned, nourishing, large portions of goodness.  They range from $14 to $15.50 or so.  There are a lot of non-vegetarian dishes, ranging from $9 or so to maybe $15.  We have not tried any appetizers or tacos.  HOWEVER- between Yelp Deals and Groupon, it is not difficult to find a $15 for $30 or $10 for $20 deal, which more than makes up for the prices.  \n\nFirst time we went, I got the Mexican Seitan dish (seitan being one of my favorite meat alternatives) and was highly pleased.  My boyfriend had the vegetarian enchiladas, so that we could share each others' meals... it was, perhaps, even better (though both were excellent).  Even the cute little pyramid of rice and little pile of beans were superbly seasoned.  Now, other vegetarians, do be careful- mention you are vegetarian.  The Chile Relleno dish in the vegetarian section was one of the things I was looking at, and when I asked the waitress for vegetarian suggestions, she mentioned that sometimes they put some animal fat in that dish- though she suggested it would be possible to just ask to make sure they would keep it vegetarian.  I really appreciated her honesty and knowledge about the dishes!  The chips and tomatillo salsa (which I normally don't like) were excellent- so fresh and yummy.  I was having a rough day, so we got a dessert to share to cheer me up... the Banana Crepes.  UNBELIEVABLE.  So tasty... we would have gone back just for that.  AND, if you check in on Yelp, you get a free dessert!!!\n\nSecond time, we tried brunch, which they have on Saturdays and Sundays till perhaps 3:00.  Our meals (some vegetarian omelet and Heuvos Rancheros for the BF) were quite good- not as good as the dinners/lunches we've had, but still very good- and were all under about $11.  This is a great time to use the $10 for $20 deal... you can get two brunch entrees for about $20.  But don't be like us and expect to use it on a Saturday- the Yelp Deal doesn't work on Fridays and Saturdays!\n\nAnd now for the time we just got back from- we had our Groupon Now, which was good until 3:00 PM, and we didn't get out until about 2:20, so we were pushing it.  Our waiter offered to ring us up early to make sure we were able to use our Groupon, and was super friendly and gracious about it.  We took advantage of our savings to each get a Cafe de Olla (sweet spiced coffee).  SO GOOD.  When we inevitably come back for a brunch, you bet we will be getting that again.  Be warned, it is quite sweet- but I just loved it.  I got the vegetarian enchiladas again, but the BF got some pork tips with avocado dish, which he said was extremely delicious and satisfying.  We ended up getting our food so quickly that we were done by 3:00 anyway- but we sat around for a bit sipping our delicious coffees and remarking on how happy the meal (which we now have leftovers of) made us!\n\nIn short, GO HERE!  We are always nervous when the small space is so empty, and would love to see it getting more business.  They deserve it!"

First of all, I'm not a giant fan of Mexican food, or heat, but I found this place to have enough choices that there were quite a few things I would have ordered easily.\nStarted with the empanadas de tinga, which were stuffed with good shredded chicken, some onions, and just enough heat. I'm sure there's something else in there, check the menu.  Another started was a very good salad, served with pineapple and pear, (I love salads with fruit in them) and a delicious cilantro dressing, the menu said glazed almonds, but they weren't there, and it was still very good.\nEntree's were enchiladas de cangrejo y camaron, which was packed with tons of crab and shrimp, and the only complaint my companion had was that they wished the topping sauce was just a little spicier.\nI ordered mole poblano, and I have to say, it was very good.  A very good size portion, served with rice and black beans (yech, don't care for those). We both couldn't finish our entree's because they were so generous, and we wanted to save room for dessert.  Flan....wonderful, but honestly, if you go there for no other reason, go for the banana crepes.  The crepe was so light, almost see through, and it was a very good finish to the meal.  I think the next time we go, we'll just order a bunch of the appetizers, and sample more.\nNo entree is over $20, with most in the $16/17 range.  Plus we had a groupon.\nI liked it and thought the food and service was fine.

I liked that they had a veggie option of saitan for an extra $1.50, but also found it strange that the default meat for the dish was beef but if you wanted chicken it was an also an extra $1.50! Not that it's necessarily gone downhill over the years, but it has definitely changed... Just not sure yet if it's for the better. Love the BYOB thing though!"

No one came to ask for water or take order. There was one waitress outside service other 4 tables but kept smiling at us and did not stop by. Finally at 845 I called inside and requested to be served. So, finally someone came outside to help us with water and get us wine glasses. So our first experience was not that good. \nThe only reason why this place gets 3 stars os because the food was very good and tasty. The place is also byob with no corkage fees. They give free chips n salsa. Salsa was descent too. Although our chips took 45 mins to arrive and came with our apps instead of upfront. For food we ordered their friend banana with beef and chicken with saffrin rice for entrees. Recommend this place for food but be prepared for lowsy service.\nNote: Dont forget to try their Deablo sauce. A little goes a long way....."

From the get go I knew service was going to be an issue. The hostess couldn't accommodate us sitting upstairs because she claimed she had to fill the first floor first so she squished us into the only remaining table downstairs. For the entire meal I felt like everyone in the restaurant could hear my conversation and I could clearly hear theirs making it a very uncomfortable dining experience. \nAfter being seated we waited over 15 minutes for someone to come get our drink orders which was completely unacceptable as there were 2 servers and only 20 people in the tiny restaurant. \nAnyways, you now understand that the service was terrible, on to the food! We started with the Chicken Quesadillas and Las Tres Marias which were corn patties topped with pork, chicken, black beans, and chipotle. The apps were yummy but I would pass on the Quesadillas as they were nothing special. For dinner we had the Chicken Mole which was only slightly above average.  The portion was average and it was $17.50 for the entree which was a bit high considering I finished my meal and was still slightly hungry. \nI would return only to try other items and if I happened to be in the neighborhood. There are other mexican restaurants in the city that are much better and as affordable."

We unfortunately did not bring any drinks with us, so we could not taste the drinks that they would mix for you, but were very happy with the food!\n\nWe split the nachos and the shrimp and crab empandas. The nachos came out piled high with guac (I was very pleased that there was no extra charge for this), meat, beans, salsa, and tonssss of cheese. It was clear that the tortilla chips were homemade as they were crunchy, thick, but not too greasy. Everything about the nachos was great and messy, exactly what I wanted!\n\nThe crab and shrimp empanadas were also really great! Came with some rice and fall vegetables and the pistachio mole blew me away! Complemented the empanadas perfectly, and the filling was great. It was a creamy filling, so if you're a fan of crab rangoon, this was kind of the mexican version of that.\n\nOn top of delicious food, we had excellent service. My water cup was constantly being refilled and the waitress checked on us just enough so that we had everything we need, but not too much that we were annoyed with her. \n\nOverall a great spot! I'll have to come again with drinks and taste the mixed drinks they have :)"

The mole enchiladas were a traditional Hispanic dish, and it brought back memories of studying abroad in Costa Rica. The eggplant dish was poorly seasoned with little to know flavor. In addition, it was really hot and ice cold in other places, which was confusing. However, the eggplant was well cooked and not mushy. Also, it had a beautiful presentation!\n\n\nWhy the three stars? This is a small location and my boyfriend and I went at the end of October. We sat next to the door because that was the only spot opened. There was a party in the upstairs room and the wait staff kept opening and closing the door allowing cold air in and the people arriving at the party kept the door open constantly too. I asked for caf\u00e9 de olla despite being eight o'clock at night because I was frozen. I told the waiter I was very cold and so was my boyfriend. He said he would try to keep the door open, which didn't happen. My boyfriend got up several times to shut the door. The waiter also forgot the coffee. So, I was annoyed and my boyfriend felt bad.

I subtracted a star because the service can be spotty, at best. The waitstaff is friendly, however pretty much every time I've eaten here (easily 20 times), they always seem to be in the weeds.

We know it costs about 25-35 cents to make the empanadas and mole, and they were charging $7.50 for each dish! The food was Good I must say, but it did not knock our socks off. \n\nThe pulled pork did not have enough Mexican spices in it, it kind of reminded us of bbq pulled pork. The seafood enchiladas were good, but for $18 bucks? They brought me out a side of hot sauce, complimented the food well.\n\nWhen we got the bill I notices they had charged us $7.00 for the margarita mix, and $1.00 for the small side of hot sauce. I felt like I was being nickel and dimed and the prices were a little steep. I would like to try out other Mexican restaurants in area and then compare them to LC, but for now... only two stars for this one.

No reply, no acknowledgement at all.\n\nBecause I was hosting family from out of town two weekends ago, the Tuesday before our family event I reserved a table for 11 people on Saturday night via Yelp. We planned our day around this, knowing we'd need to be in No Libs by 7.\n\nI received a phone call to confirm at 12:30, as well as a text message and an email. Three confirmations. When I called around 3 to add one more person, I was told that it wouldn't be a problem but they appreciated the call. Lo an behold, after the 12 of us piled into Ubers and arrived, laden with a few six-packs and a bottle of tequila, we were told there was no reservation; it must have been lost. We spoke to a woman who identified herself as the manager, and with a shrug and an apology, she turned us away.\n\nI couldn't believe this. First of all, we had planned our day around this and spent money and time on transportation to get to our reservation that had been thrice confirmed. Secondly, I was extremely embarrassed to tell my family that the nice dinner we were looking forward to and that I had planned had been cancelled without our knowing it. Finally, to be turned away without any sort of compensation, a coupon off a future visit, anything to attempt to apologize for the inconvenience, was unacceptable.\n\nI am surprised and disappointed by this. As I mentioned in my previous review, I had always had a great experience at this restaurant. At this point, I have no plans to return and I certainly will never make a reservation for a large group again."

Ambiance is warm and cute.  The only consistently mediocre thing is the service.  The servers have always been very sweet and accommodating, but they lack professionalism / experience.\n\nI've visited Las Cazuelas three times, each time with my boyfriend and out of town guests.  Each time, our party was very happy with the food and pleasantly surprised, given preconceptions of Mexican food as well as the neighborhood.  (Neighborhood is fine, but that strip of Girard is not where you're expecting to find great food.)  On the first visit, our guests sniffed at the prices for Mexican food but ended the meal gushing about how good it was and planning to return.  (We've been trained that Mexican dishes over $10 must be overpriced.)\n\nThe entrees come to the table beautifully plated.  All eyes at the table light up!  Our favorites include the Chipotle shrimp, and the Chile Relleno.  My sister is a mole aficionado  and loved their mole sauce.  My \"difficult\" friend ordered the Arroz con Pollo, and loved it.  On my last visit, I ordered the Pork Chop which was so impressively composed on the plate with multiple sauces and so many complementing flavors.  And it passed my test of whether I could just as easily have made the dish at home.  The only mediocre dish we've seen was the beef tips - uninspired.  This isn't five star fancy food, but it is as good as most of the good byob's in Philly.  And it's inexpensive by comparison.  Bring a bottle of Tequila and they'll make you a decent Margarita pitcher for $6.  \n\nRegarding the service, our worst visit was a mid-week visit.  They were out of the ingredients to mix Sangria with our bottle of Red Wine and they didn't have any specials.  The server explained that the chef hadn't been in that day!  We didn't need to hear that.  All three entrees came out lovely and delicious, but there was such an uneasy feeling as we waited, wondering if we shouldn't have come that night."

They bill themselves as a Regional Mexican place, but the menu seems to be broader than just Mexico.  They have an open kitchen, so you can see the meal preparations and it is a BYOB - so bring your wine, beer, or as many do, your own tequila and make Margaritas.   The prices are reasonable and the menu is extensive.  The Shrimp Ceviche is great and I love their Camarrones Chipotle (Jumbo shrimp marinated in olive oil and garlic topped with chipotle sauce).  We also ordered a Fiesta Platter, which is just that - a fiesta of many delicious Mexican appetizers (Chicken Empanada, Taco Dorado, Cheese Quesadilla, and more) - they say for 4, but it also makes a fun entre!  The Guacamole Ranchero is delicious and their Cochinita Pibl (braised pork shoulder) melts in your mouth.  Street parking is usually no problem and the vibe is casual and comfortable.

We picked up a few beers from the Foodery and stopped by.\n\nThe spot is tiny, but nice. there are about ten tables across the dining area with a small, open kitchen. The walls are brightly painted, and there are several other endearing decorations. I don't usually go crazy over atmosphere, and one shouldn't expect anything from a place on 5th and Girard, but the decor is well done.\n\nI don't want to make a blanket statement about the service but here are two of my observation's: Las Cazuelas and the Abbaye share some staff, to my chagrin. Second, my first choice on the menu wasn't available (the last two were served moments before). I'm not a restaurant manager, but running out of a dish before lunch (let alone dinner) is finished seems to be problematic. One plus are the free chips and salsa verde as soon as you sit down.\n\nThe food came out quickly. I ended up with a dish with rice and pan-seared shrimp, along with caramelized mixed veggies. Everything was acceptable, but I can't rave about anything. The portions could have been a bit bigger. Dan went with marinated beef tips, with refried beans and avocado. He said that the meat wasn't the best cut, and it marinade could have been improved upon. Neither of us could remark about anything other that the fact that we were getting a \"good deal for the money.\"\n\nFor our drinks, we picked up Rouge's Chili Ale, which had a great pepper taste that didn't overpower. It was a great way to start our meal. We had the Hot Rock lager from Port Brewing to finish, which was a solid, but not outstanding, lager.\n\nBottom Line: I'd prefer not to bash a place that is offering such a great deal. I like the initiative to get in new customers. But with a plethora of good Mexican spots, one of my favorites only a few blocks a way, I can't see myself ever going back here."

        "text": "I love to try new restaurants, and when I saw the reviews for Las Cazuelas on yelp I had to check it out... well that, aannd I was craving Mexican food . \n\nAfter seeing that Las Cazuelas is a BYOB spot, around 7:30 PM on a Thursday my boyfriend and I drove to the liquor store for some tequila (patron to be specific), which were about $6 each for the mini bottles (I bought 2, should have bought 4 ). Anyway,  we got to the restaurant around 8 PM and there were about 4 groups already seated, half inside half outside. It was a bit awkward walking in because no one was there to immediately greet us, but as soon as we saw thee ONLY server at the time named Josie, she let us know she would be with us. \n\nMy bf and I chose to sit outside because it was a nice day in May hehe, and luckily we got there in time because more people started arriving after us. Oh btw, Las Cazuelas closes at 10 PM on Thursday. We were seated outside by Josie who was a great waitress; she spoke loud and clear, described the meals in detail and was very attentive. My bf and I started our meal off with a free pitcher of Pomegranate/Mango  Marguerita (bf's choice to mix, I just wanted classic ). Also the free pitcher coupon was received from yelp, Thank you yelp . So we then got the sampler appetizer for starters. I asked Josie what the most popular chicken meal was and she stated that it was the Arroz Con Pollo,  I got that and my bf got Nachos for the main course. \n\nBy the time our main course came out, my bf and I were so full from the Marguerita, sampler, and chips and dip, we asked for two boxes to go and the bill. But from what I did eat... the Arroz Con Pollo was really good, the added sliced avocados on top really made it delightful and the black beans that came along with the meal were the best part in my opinion. My grandmother makes Arroz Con Pollo, so I can't lie, I did compare theirs to hers, but my grandmother is from Central America so of-course the taste is going to be slightly different. Nothing beats grandmas cooking though. I also tried my boyfriends Nachos... they were good as well, definitely authentic ingredients, I would say Las Cazuelas also makes their own chips because the taste and crunch is different then most, but I am not sure about that. \n\nAll in All, I give Las Cazuelas 4 stars for their customer service first (Josie was awesome), and their meals second (Loved those beans). I would definitely return to try more!!"

Double win! Corn on the cob (mmmm cotija cheese!) was delicious. The queso fundido was eh. It immediately congealed and it was hard to eat. My tacos al pastor were good but not the best I ever had. I didn't get to taste anybody else's food but they all were so happy about their choices. Oh, p.s. if you can, order the sweet plantains--freakin' delicious. I suggest you come, taste for yourself and enjoy this small, low-key restaurant. Elite Yelp tip: You can walk 5 mins to 2nd and Girard and get booze if you need it. Amazeballs.

It was still a reasonable portion size for two people and that little drizzling of mole sauce on the side made me a believer again! They did very well with their entrees, and I appreciated that they didn't have a thousand options to choose from like in other Mexican restaurants. I ordered a house special of red snapper with Mexican rice and it was delish! My friend had the Arrachera, a skirt steak that I actually enjoyed more than my fish. I'm sure I'll be back, seeing as though the place is on the trolley line and its just a quick jaunt to Northern Liberties."

We were seated promptly in the downstairs area. Empty when we arrived by full by departure. Everyone gave sincere greetings and were super nice. We were immediately brought glasses for our wine. \n\nWe had delicious course after delicious course starting with the chicken empanadas, onto the chicken nachos, fish tacos for me and carnitas tacos for her, and then dessert to share. The fish tacos were a delicious work of art and the carnitas were out of this world. \nIt would be impossible to say what we liked most, but the biggest surprise of the evening was the dessert. I can't remember the name but it was sweetened cream cheese, in a rolled tortilla, fried, tossed in cinnamon sugar and plated with mango jam and whipped cream. I call it a surprise because we aren't frequent dessert eaters and we almost NEVER eat anything cream or cream cheese bases. But despite already being full and satisfied with our already lovely evening, we DEVOURED the dessert.\n\n The best part is that it only cost us $35! A steal for the quality.\n\nI'd love to keep this place a secret and have it all to ourselves, but you need business to stay open so there's that. Happy dining!"

After missing our original movie time CB and i were famished and in need of a place that was open for lunch and close to /in Nolibs. After a combination of yelping and groupon nowing we decided on Las Cazuelas. We walked in and the place was empty as in the kitchen staff , hostess and waitress were all standing around not usually a good sign but we went with it. After seating us at a table the hostess/waitress offered up bevs since we did not want to imbibe before the film we went with mexican sodas pina for me and orange for CB. Chips and salsa arrived at the table and the salsa had a surprising sweet flavor but it was cold (weird) but still tasty. We started with the fundidio which comes with your choice of mushrooms, chorizo or poblano peppers. We opted for the peppers. The fundido was perfect the peppers added a little kick and the cheese was stringy greasy perfection. My only gripe was we only got 3 flour tortillas so its a good thing we still had plenty of chips left or all that fundido would have been wasted. I couldn't decide if i wanted 2 or 3 tacos and at 2.75 each ( A STEAL ) i got 3 shrimp tacos authentic w/ cilantro and onions. I expected nothing like what i received. 3 huge shrimp tacos each holding 3 GIANT shrimp and just a sprinkling of onions the perfect ratio. the shrimp were cooked amazingly well and were seasoned with a slight spice YUM. CB tried each of the chicken taco options and one shrimp he enjoyed them all very much. Since they offered dessert and I'm a sucker for sweet things we split the tres leches cake which was very moist and creamy. I wrapped up my lunch with a mexican coffee hot and sweet with just a little punch. Our service was great and towards the end of lunch more tables arrived.\nThis restaurant is a little on the small side (downstairs has less than 6 tables I'm sure it would be great for groups though) Id say come here for a start to your friday night since its a BYOT and a BYOB . The menu is very reasonable and the parking situation is pretty awesome . I will def be back i think i found my Philly Mexican GO TO SPOT"

We probably could have finished it comfortably had we been hungrier. The ceviches were decent, the shrimp better than the tillapia, which had an interesting spicy-fruity taste. The appetizer sampler at $16 was huge, with delicious empanadas and very good tacos dorados. Their salsa is mildly spicy and tasty. The nachos were pretty good, served with a thick bean paste, melted cotija cheese, and a sprinkling of diced tomatoes.\n\nOn the downside: the tamales were a little dry (as tamales are apt to be). Some of our chips were quite stale (and strangely had gone a little soft), and the avocado we were served with the ceviche was inedibly unripe. If that's their idea of how avocado should be served, I'm afraid to try their guacamole. Also, this place is just a tad more expensive than I usually like to pay for Mexican food, as entrees averaged about $18. Who knows though, maybe they're so fantastically delicious that they're worth the price. I guess that remains to be seen, but for now, 3 stars."

Throw in mariachis and boat-drink support and it's almost enough to ignore the blasts of cold winter air rushing in each time the door opens and pretend you're chillaxing in Jalisco.\n\nPros\n-For Mexican it mostly starts and ends with the food. We had the Sopa Azteca and Ceviches for starters (both delicious, the sopa azteca exquisitely spicy) before moving onto the skirt steak and mole enchiladas, both were terrific.\n-Price - there's nothing here to suggest the fusion with New American ala Xochitl or Lolita, so stuff costs what it should. \n-BYOB\n\nCons\n-Nothing overriding here. Since it's the season, I'd seek a redress for the aforementioned blasting cold air problem when the door opens, but some might find that refreshing, particularly when braced with a spicy bowl of Sopa Azteca."

Were there problems in the service that night? Absolutely. Even at the bar, there was no bartender and the waitress was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. But instead of speaking to them with a \"threatening\" tone like the below reviewer did, we waited...\n\nFinally, DUE TO OUR PATIENCE AND KINDNESS FOR HUMANITY (instead of being a complete self-entitled jerk to people who are just doing their jobs), we were seated at a table upstairs. It was now 9PM. An hour wait on Cinco De Mayo from the time we got there is NOT bad at all. Plus, this place is BYO so we had tequila shots to hold us over. Not to mention the chips and salsa they immediately served us upon sitting at the bar. \n\nWe ordered our food right away and our pitchers of margs. \n\nThe food alone was so worth the wait and I genuinely pity those that left this restaurant in anger and impatience because dude, you missed out! \n\nThe Carne Asada tacos were BOMB! Empanadas were prob the best I've ever had and their Queso dip was so cheesy and delicious that my mouth is watering all over again thinking about it. My friends had the shrimp tacos, Pastor tacos and my husband had the Chorizo Burrito (which was as big as my head!) All soooo delicious!\n\nWhere this establishment lacked in service, the food clearly made up for it. Could/should they have been more prepared? ABSOLUTELY. No arguments there but I truly felt bad for them that night. People were yelling and screaming for a table, their food and the waitresses were doing their best! They clearly never had a rush like this before but they made up for it. \n\nWhen the bill came, they comped us an appetizer and our two pitchers of margs for being so patient with them. And for the reviewers that called this place expensive..a taco order that comes with 3 tacos was $8....you pay more at a food truck, bruh. \n\nOur waitress was so sweet, frazzled, but you could see in her face how upset she was for not being able to cater to everyones needs the way she wanted. Adam, whom I am assuming is a bus boy?, took control and was the one who seated us at the bar, gave us chips and salsa to hold us over, tracked down our waitress, got us our table and then gave us grubhub coupons as an apology. If this kid is not on the wait staff, he should be! He's the reason why we didn't mind being so patient. \n\nAll in all, the food was amazing and you shouldn't write this place off from one terrible experience on the busiest night of the year for them. Compassion and humanity go a long way, especially when your nice to those that handle your food!"

The service was fast and our server was so friendly. They give you chips & salsa verde as you sit down -- and let me tell you, that salsa was amazing! We ended up ordering guacamole (delicious), Arrachera, 2 Mexican Coffees and fried ice cream. Everything was great. I highly recommend going here, and I will definitely be stopping by again! Don't forget to buy a Groupon or check in on yelp to uncover some deals before checking it out."

I've been to Dos Segundos before and although it is more prototypically what you visualize for American Mexican it was not what I was in the mood for.    I also considered El Camino Real but, once again, not quite what I was after.  I found Las Cazuelas and it was well reviewed plus it was BYO.  It seemed well reviewed so I was looking forward to it.\n\nWe brought a bottle and we showed up.  It is a nice, small, one room place with a pleasant staff.  They were proud of their Mole sauce so that is what I ordered, over chicken.  My date had the vegetable enchiladas.  We both cleaned our plates.  The food was pretty good.\n\nI will say this.  Based on the address I was expecting maybe more of a hole in the wall taqueria than a kind of fancy $20 entree place.  The truth is that is what I was looking for so I was disappointed but I did feel that I got my $50 worth.\n\nNow that I know what to expect I would definitely return."

I visited Las Cazuelas for the second time last night.  Yelp deems three stars as \"A-ok\" and I think that is a very fitting label for Las Cazuelas.  It is a step up from many Mexican BYO's if decor and ambiance is what you're looking for.  The space is large, with ample upstairs seating.  It is a bit pricier than some other Mexican BYO's . . . but that's because the menu is more advanced than burritos and tacos.  \n\nWe started with the queso fundido . . . as always.  This was good, standard, and enjoyable.  We also got the tacos dorados, which were also fairly standard and enjoyable.  I ordered the enchiladas with crab, which again, I found to be standard and enjoyable.  Nothing was bad; nothing was outstanding.  \n\nIt is a great place to go with a group as it does have the seating and capacity.  And they take credit cards-woohooo!"

I heard a lot about this place and wanted to try it so the food was pretty good it has a great mixture of authentic and Tex mex but overall it wasn't bad if I lived in this neighborhood this would be my favorite Mexican spot not getaway lol....I ordered basically a carne Asada with rice and beans the steak was to die for I wish is wasn't well done because it would be a little bit better but the flavor was excellent that was my favorite dish of the night. My Bf had a burrito I believe it could have been better but it was pretty packed and he was full.   My all time favorite of the night was the dessert we shared a \"tres Leche cake\" I'm pretty sure that was the wrong name but Im close and I have pictures so you will see.... this cake was amazing!! It was a little dry at the top but they basically had like a homemade whipped cream for the top which was amazing and the best part was the bottom which was very moist that held the three different types of milk on the bottom. I would share the secret but I was told not too lol you just have to try it! I would say that this place can deserve five stars but they have to work on some their waitress staff so these stars I put was for my overall experience. 3 stars for the overall experience 4 stars for\nThe cake!"

Boy was I wrong, the place was empty and we were the only two people in there for the first hour it was open which is a little odd for a brunch place that seems to be quite popular and well reviewed.  The waitress was nice enough but seemed flustered which was also strange since we were her only customers, something just didn't feel right about this place.  We ordered the tamales which were gross, just a thick heavy corn batter steamed with a barely flavored cheese that resembled silly putty and didn't taste much better.  I ordered the poblano omelette which was supposed to come with roasted poblano peppers but it was basically the same omelet you can get at any diner in the world, cheese, red & green bell peppers and mushrooms but if you're paying attention you notice I didn't mention the roasted poblano because the omelette was completely devoid of it, I almost thought I by chance ordered the wrong meal because how can you honestly forget the ingredient the dish is named after, it's like ordering a fish taco but not actually getting fish in the tortilla.  I've eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner at many Mexican restaurants on both coasts and I must say this was the worst I've experienced, the food just didn't taste good nor the ingredients.  I didn't even bother to ask them to replace my meal with the proper ingredients because I feared what would come out next.  To add insult to injury I asked for some hot sauce (you know because the omelette had no flavor sans the poblano peppers) which was provided but I got charged an extra dollar for that lovely privilege.  Do yourself a favor and grab Mexican food at the myriad of other taquerias in Philly that offer a wholesome, fresh Mexican meal which is the exact opposite you can expect from this place, the one word I have for this place is gross."

If you bring your own tequila, you can get a pitcher of margaritas for $8 (free if you check in on yelp)! The margarita pitcher was really big and enough for four people to have two-three large glasses. Aside from the margarita pitcher, my table opted to share two order of guac between the four of us. Chips were unlimited and came with salsa verde as well. The chips are very filling so be sure to save room for whatever you plan on ordering. The guac portions were also pretty large, so in the future I do think one order would be fine for four people.\n\nI then ordered the seitan tacos, which were excellent. For 7.50, I got three large tacos. They offer both flour and corn tortillas so be sure to specify which you prefer. Their seitan was delicious...tender and with lots of cilantro! I had had seitan once before and did not like it much, but Las Cazuelas changed my mind!

And most definitely not worth the price, even with a half off deal.  The positives were really difficult to focus on because there was no AC or fans or anything.  Just stagnant, hot air.  Its a shame because it was a lovely, breezy summer night outside.  I guess they're trying to cut costs?  We thought about dessert but I couldn't take the heat anymore.\n\nThe server was great, but we were his only table so that's to be expected.  The overall vibe wasn't that of a fun mexican restaurant.  It was eerily quiet and empty and sad.  It didn't feel like a fun dining experience.  It felt like I spent way too much money to eat as quickly as possible and leave.\n\nThe nachos were very good.  Nice balance in flavors, but too much topping for too little chips.  Still I'd give the nachos alone 4 stars.  The mole enchiladas were a 2 star dish.  Bland and heavy.  When I spend $20 on 3 enchiladas I expect a certain level of culinary skill, not heavy, dense home cooking.\n\nOverall I went back and forth between 2 and 3 stars.

My friends and I are on endless hunt for mexican and have found the seemingly hole in a wall places to have the most high quality food for this genre (Im serious about the endless hunt, we're guilty of burritos for breakfast). \n\nThis place had some pretty creative dishes and had such authentic fresh ingredients. We had a pistachio mole sauce on some fish enchiladas, which was our selling factor for going in the first place. Who else has pistachio mole sauce?! The chips were made there and had the perfect texture. Both dishes we got had their wow factors and extras we weren't expecting. The enchiladas came with rice and some tasty veggies and the nachos came with meat and guac on it that we didn't expect. \n\nRule of thumb: If your mexican places includes oaxaca and chihuahua cheese, they're awesome and probably know what they're doing."

We told them straight up that we had a Groupon and they did not treat us any worse for it. We even lingered a bit after the meal and they just refilled our water and let us carried on with our conversation. \n\nThere was free chips and salsa, which I really like. What is up with people charging for chips at a Mexican restaurant? That's like charging for bread at an Italian restaurant! My arroz con pollo ($16) was exactly what I wanted. Stuffed with olives, chicken, and avocado with a side of black beans, it was more than enough for my dinner and my lunch the next day. One of my friend ordered the Chicken Mole Enchilada and wasn't too pleased with it, however I think it 's more of a personal preference since the bite I had was really good. Another one didn't care for the cheese on her Crabmeat and Shrimp Enchilada- again, I think that's a personal preference. My other friends were quite pleased with their choices.\n\nMy banana crepes ($6) were pretty good, though I didn't see any walnuts like the menu suggested and I think they used plantains instead of bananas. However, the ultimate dessert has to be the Abuleita Hot Chocolate ($3). Since we sat right in front of the kitchen, we were able to see the chef whisked everything together and it was just the perfect thing to end the meal. The waitress even stopped by to apologized for the delay in our hot chocolate since it had to be freshly mixed.\n\nAfter our coupon, I think we each paid $17, not including tips. Not too bad."

On one hand their food was delicious - seriously amazing guacamole, insane appetizer platter, on point chimichurri asada.  But their service (and this is coming from somebody who NEVER complains about service and always tips more than she should) was TERRIBLE.\n\nYou know something is wrong if you've finished the first round of appetizers and you still have yet to get either silverware or sharing plates.  Also those margaritas you asked for never came, until you finally managed to flag down your waitress (after multiple attempts) and practically begged her.  Trying to figure out how the heck you were going to eat the next plate of food without a fork or knife or ANYTHING, you asked the guy who came to clear your plates if you could please get some sort of utensils and maybe plates if that wasn't too much to ask, napkins would be marvelous.  Miraculously after 10-15 minutes of staring at the appetizer sampler your prayers were answered!  But still no napkins.  Your water glass was never refilled throughout the duration of the meal, and it took you 10 minutes to find the waitress to ask for the check, a good 15 minutes for her to bring you the check, 15 more minutes until you could wave her down so she could take your credit card, and 10 minutes until she came back with the receipt.\n\nIt really wasn't the waitress's fault either - she was really nice, and it was apparently her first week on the job and she was covering the restaurant BY HERSELF on a Sunday night.  She was clearly trying her best to deal with the crappy situation the management had put her in.  Nobody can cover a whole restaurant (even one as small as Las Cazuelas) by themselves when it's a full house!\n\nAll in all I'm probably going to give them another try - like I said, their food was great!  They just have some very obvious service issues to work out.  Scheduling multiple servers would probably be a good start.\n\nI just hope next time we at least get some napkins..."

I agree with a few other reviewers here who say the food isn't bad but it certainly isn't good either.  This is the only mexican place I have ever been where they charge $1 per very small cup of hot sauce!  Granted the hot sauce was very good (really the only stand out part of the meal) but $1 for a cup the size of thimble!? Food aside, the real issue I had here is the service and atmosphere.  First we were placed in a secondary room that was completely empty because the first room was ALMOST completely full (there were still some seats left and we were a party of 2).  We said this was fine because they said it would be a nice quiet room.  It is not.  It is basically the hang-out for the wait staff.  Then about 20 minutes in they seat a party in the room that obviously had reserved the room for a private event!  It was incredibly loud and the private party was as annoyed as we were by having the shared space.  Then our waitress spilled my meal on my lap and blamed it on my bag that was under the table (where else am I supposed to put it when the tables are about 7-8 inches from each other?), took our chips without asking but left our guacamole(??) and took our bottle opener because, although this place is BYO we were told they only keep 2 bottle openers in the whole restaurant!  Overall service was just appalling and even if the food had been stellar it would be hard to recommend this place for anything other than the occasional take out."

That being said, Las Cazuelas is definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants we have found on the East Coast in terms of authentic flavors. We've been there twice now from brunch, and last night was the first time we went for dinner.\n\nDinner was amazing - I got the Mole Poblano, which is probably the best Mole that I have ever had. My wife said it tasted exactly like the Mole that she used to have when she was staying with a family in Ensanada, Mexico. She had a chicken in a special Guajillo chile sauce that was incredibly rich but super delicious.\n\nBrunch both times we have gone blew our socks off. Also, don't miss out on the coffee! Their cafe au lait is superb, and the cafe de olla reminds me exactly of the coffee at a little Mexican place in San Diego that I went when I was young. \n\nSo why only 4 stars? The entree prices for dinner are a little steep. If you go, definitely use a Yelp deal, living social, etc. Brunch prices are right on the money (and portions are huge!), lunch prices seem right, it's just dinner that's a little steep. Granted, the portions are extremely generous (my wife had a full dinner and two lunch portions left to take to work this week), but instead of $16-20, I would expect to see more like $10-16 for dinner prices at a location like this. \n\nWe'll definitely be returning for brunch very soon!"

Sometimes I wish that hubby would open a Yelp account as he was thrilled with Las Cazuelas. \n\nMichael had a huge plate of three large enchiladas, substituting ground beef for the chicken and asking for the mole sauce to be on the side. The mole sauce was amazing, I'm not surprised that it has won awards and I dipped my everything in it! His meal came with a nice sized portion of black refried beans and \"Mexican rice\", nothing like a Spanish rice, very plain, no onions or peppers, yellow rice.\n\nI could not get past the list of appetizers, so I ordered three as my meal, oh shush...  Queso fundido, which means melted cheese, not, it was one big blob of cheese, nothing dippy or stringy about it, hardened within seconds and it would have taken a knife and fork to cut it and it was not blended with the extra additions of chorizo and mushrooms, but was swimming in a spicy and extremely greasy sauce and served with three tortillas, to do what with, ugh, I have no clue. I packed this up to take home and try to melt, which it refused to do and I kept thinking, imagine what that would do to my arteries, so I chucked it. I guess I could have pretended it was string cheese and sliced it and ate it cold in its hardened form.\n\nThe guacamole ranchero was good, nothing special, I've had much better guacamole and chips, but it was satisfying, although a very small portion. The shrimp ceviche was very enjoyable, again, a small portion for the price. I also had a side dish of refried beans, that I asked to be topped with lots of raw onion and cheese and I really did like this dish.\n\nI checked out their brunch menu which is very enticing and I would love to return with gung ho hubby to indulge in this."

I found it to be bland, even after I added salt and pepper to it. The highlight of the dish was the melted, stringy Oaxaca cheese.  The bf also ordered something different than his norm, and while he enjoyed his arroz con pollo more than I enjoyed my meal he will not be ordering it again either. \n\nI still really like the vibe and location of this restaurant so we will give them another shot.

Whether this was intentional or not, it is EXTREMELY disappointing.  You should be able to trust a restaurant.  If this was intentional, not only was it not funny but my belly hurt all day.  If this was unintentional, than I would have to comment on the lack of organization and cleanliness of the restaurant because we were one of three tables there all night, there was no reason to get pork mixed in a vegetarian dish.  Completely disappointing.  I understand that a meat eater may not understand why this is such a big deal, but it is IMPORTANT to me.  They are lazy and cannot be trusted.  Even if you eat meat, if this is how they run their restaurant, what are they half-assing for you? Do not eat here.   Terrible, terrible disgrace for a restaurant."

We got the Yelp check in for a free pitcher of mags, of which we added our own tequila to! The margaritas were good, except we wanted salt around our glasses and no one offered. We started with guac and the complimentary chips and salsa. The guac and salsa were excellent ---very fresh, vibrant, flavorful. We did not enjoy the thick-cut chips so much. I absolutely LOVED the pork tacos with grilled pineapple. They actually bumped my review up from a 3 to 4 star. My boyfriend did not enjoy his chicken enchiladas as much, but I think it was a more acquired taste. Our server was a little odd...he randomly interrupted our order to go seat a patron who walked in which we thought was rude. He seemed a little unexperienced but was friendly none the less. We left full and buzzed off the margs so of course we had a great time!"

I ordered the arroz con pollo and it was amazing! Very flavorful and moist and large portions as well. My bf got the cochinita pibil, which was good, but didn't compare to the arroz! I heard they have the best mole sauce so I can't wait to come back and try the mole enchiladas!\n\nOne bad thing about this place, however, is the service.

At this point in the meal, the oilines from the plantains earlier and this felt too heavy for one meal. I liked the side of guac, but I didn't care much for the beans and rice.\n\nOverall, not bad for the Groupon deal but not sure if I liked it that much that I would come back versus trying out another Mexican place.

Las Cazuelas does not cater to the tex-mex crowd, instead the restaurant focuses on the traditional Mexican stylings. I especially like the the plantain chip appetizer special and the Conchita Pibil (although it definitely tastes different in Mexico). I have tried other items on the menu and have never been disappointed. The dessert menu is pretty decent and the tres leche is always ordered by a few people at our table. Although the tres leche is tres bien, I tried the banana crepe dessert once and have not gone back to tres leche. I love that the chips and salsa are served right after you sit down. For all the awesomeness that the food brings to the table, the wait staff always leaves me feeling under appreciated. For the most part, the staff is not very attentive. I'm sorry, but yes I do want a refill of my water and chips/salsa without having to ask. I also want the waiters to notice when we need another bottle of wine opened. \nOn the subject of wine...Las Cazuelas is byob. Unlike Lolita, Las Cazuelas provides the margarita mix free of charge (I have not picked up the bill in a while, so I am assuming this is still the case). Overall, this is a great byob for consistently good food."

Now you can substitute seitan in almost any of the dishes and they are very accomodating.

We recently went for lunch and the two of us ate for less than $15, and it was really good!  The complimentary tortilla chips are the best amongst the local competition.

The first time I visited was with a group of of 7 for my birthday and it was great! The service was wonderful, they were prompt, accommodating and did not rush us at all. The only thing I wasn't crazy about the first time was the mole chicken enchiladas I got...I think I just didn't like the sauce but everyone else was happy with their meals. The last time we went which was last weekend was a bit different. Again it was 7 people and again for my birthday...the restaurant I had initially planned on was overbooked (not that I didn't wanna go here I was just trying to change it up) so Las Cazuelas was the only place that was able to make last minute accommodations for a party of 7 on a Saturday night (AND we were running late and they were super nice about it so props on both counts). However, I think they just got slammed because the waitress we had was sweet but all over the place. She checked in with us twice to get our order then disappeared for a while to the point where we had to flag someone down to get her to come back. It took about an hour for our food to come out and at the last minute before our food came out we were told they were out of crab so someone had to re-order (it ended up being a mix-up but still it was at least 45 minutes after we placed our order that they came out to tell us this). When they brought out the dishes they brought them out at all different times instead of together (like it was 10 minutes from when the first person received their food to the last person to get their's, and the last person had to inquire about it before someone brought it out) I really enjoyed my dish (I got the crab enchiladas) but a few people at my table weren't satisfied with theirs (meat was overcooked and someone else got the mole enchiladas which they didn't like either). \n\nOverall I like this place and may return again, the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating and for the most part the food is really good.

The place was empty and there was only one waiter working.\n\nI ordered the camarones tropical at the behest of the waiter. While waiting for my meal, I was pleasantly surprised to be given free chips and salss. This is not a taqueria. There's not a burrito on the menu, so they are under no obligation to give you chips and salsa, but they did anyway. While the chips were average, the red sauce was very good.\n\nThe entree came out. It was an array of jumbo shrimp with rice, mixed veggies and plantains all bathed in a coconut milk, mango and habanero sauce. It was one of the tastiest meals I've ever had. The shrimp were cooked just right. The vegetables and rice were fresh and hot. The plantains were crunchy, which was a perfect addition since I love some crunch mixed in with my food. And the coconut/mango/habanero sauce was stellar. It made the meal. It was some of the best Mexican I've ever had, and I'll go back in a heartbeat.\n\nThe place got a little more crowded and the waiter was alone, so I was aware that some of the customers had to wait a little bit longer than I did, but trust me, the food at Las Cazuelas is worth the wait."

While the service is often disappointing the food is usually delicious and, as a local, I was quickly becoming a regular.

My mom, knowing I was a fan, purchased one for my fianc\u00e9 and I as well as one for herself.\n\nLast night she decided to come in for dinner and was excited to try it here. As we both had the groupon and it was expiring soon she called ahead, TWICE, to ask if we could both use it. The girl who answered claimed she spoke to the owner and as long as we got separate checks it was fine. She drove in from NJ. Upon arrival our waiter told us he couldn't take the groupons, despite my mom's calls. We were disappointed and after discussing with him, he agreed that as long as we did separate checks it would be fine. We even made an effort to separate our tables to make the waiter more comfortable. We had a good meal, the food took a long time to come out and didn't come out at once but otherwise everything was good. My step dad was ready to tip our waiter very generously for being so accommodating.\n\nThe waiter returned to drop our two SEPARATE checks and informed us that he was sorry but could in fact only take one groupon. Really? So we were lied to not once, but twice. For the sake of $13 this restaurant lost 4 patrons, 2 of which were quickly becoming regulars and recommending it to everyone.

We will be there by 7:15.!\" We got there extra early (about 7:05pm) so that we would not lose our reservation. We gave  the young woman at the host stand our name. She said, \"it says you were supposed to be here by 6:30.\" I explained that that could not be possible, and I went through the whole exchange I had with the woman on the phone. She unapologetically stated, \"we have to go by the book,\" and completely dismissed us. I pleaded with her and reassured her that our reservation was definitely for 7:30 according to my conversation with the woman over the phone. I had friends driving from pretty far to meet us there. She repeated, \"we can't seat you,\" and basically walked away from us. It was freezing cold and sleeting outside. We had taken an Uber there and had no choice but to stand there and call our friends and wait for our uber back home. It was humiliating. As a young professional couple with no children, we go out often, and I have never been treated this way. The woman (and everyone else in the restaurant) was so rude and dismissive, despite the fact that the restaurant made an error. No apology whatsoever was offered. So, I asked to speak to a manager (something I have never done!). She replied that there was no manager (???!!!). I understand that mistakes happen, and that's ok.  However, it was the rude, dismissive behavior that really got to me. Even the slightest attempt at an apology would have ensured that I was not prompted to write a negative review of this restaurant that I really enjoyed eating at before. Sadly, with this terrible service experience, I could NEVER see myself returning there or recommending this place to anyone. To the managers, owners, hostesses at this place, you have my phone number - the reservation was for four people at 7:30pm on Saturday, February 17th, not 6:30!!!! Your apologies are still welcome and would be greatly appreciated. You really put a damper on a night that was meticulously planned to celebrate a dear friend's birthday. I hope you never treat anyone else like this again!"

Even though we had a reservation, there was a lot of confusion at check in. We were being helped by a young boy (maybe 10-12 yo). After standing around for 10 min or so he sat us at a table in the main dining room with the worst sun glare imaginable. We then waited another 10 minutes or so to get seated in the back room, which was freezing cold. \n\nOur server was dazed and confused. There was a large party in the back room with us that just seemed to completely overwhelm him. He would deliver something to our table and then just walk away quickly, so we had to call after him to come back because we needed something. \n\nThe guacamole was bland. We had to add salt and pepper to make it edible. The chips provided were bottom of the bag crumbs, so we had to flag the server down for more. The chicken tacos and chicken enchiladas were okay, but nothing special. The enchiladas came with a mole sauce, which for me was an acquired taste. The rice and beans also lacked flavor. \n\nThe restaurant is BYO which I didn't realize ahead of time. \n\nI would not recommend going out of your way to dine here... there are much better Mexican restaurants in the city!"

I was ecstatic when my friend suggested a group of us BYO here as it is supposedly a Venezuelan restaurant.  \n\nI have always sat in the larger party rooms, but the front room is small and dimly lit.  Romantic for a couple on a less crowded night.  The chips and salsa are a little on the salty side.  You do not need to order extra hot salsa or extra hot anything if it already comes hot at this restaurant.  I love spicy and asking for more here has gotten the best of me.  The chicken and rice is to die for as well as anything with shrimp.  Both come succulent and well-seasoned.  The rice is cooked a little differently than most traditional mexican rice.  It's hard and tastes a little undercooked, similar to a lot of authentic paella dishes from Spain.  That's how it's suppose to be prepared, but if you like it more well-cooked, they're happy to oblige.  My roommate ordered a shrimp salad (again, anything with their shrimp can't go wrong).  Everyone loved what was ordered.  Dessert was also really yummy.  The flan was smooth and creamy and the fried bananas were also a go.  I don't think you can order wrong on the menu.\n\nSince it is byo, they have a special where if you have a certain number of people and order several pitchers of magarita mix, the first one is on the house!  So yes to bringing tequila and making it a fun night to remember.  The waiters are happy to take shots all around.  We even got the cooks to come take one with us since it was close to closing time.  A fun and tasty place to be if you're looking to reconnect with a group of people."

The ingredients were not fresh, and it seemed like they put the bare minimum of each ingredient. \n\nI have loved everything I've ever tried from Las Cazuelas, both delivery and when dining in, but this burrito was totally out of character.

On the menu tacos are 9 but on the check they was 10$, like come on. And there are no drinks on the menu. I had to ask the servers about the drinks. Like why couldn't she tell me about the drinks. The server should tell the guest about the drinks. Ok after that we ordered our appetizers and our drinks so we got our appetizers but we had to remind our server 3 times about our drinks. We order nachos and guacamole. The guacamole was so lemony and the salsa verde had no salt what so ever. So we asked for salt and again we had to remind her 3 times for the salt. We order a torta and it was not what I expected. It was so plain and we ordered the soup of the day but it was extremely spicy like there was no warning about it being spicy. Like warn us first. Okay so we get our entrees and we ordered a side of salsa roja and when I say it's expired it's expired. So we told our server and she took it to the chef and the chef said it was just garlic. I don't know if the chef has no taste buds but a salsa roja doesn't taste bad just because of garlic. It was expired. And then the server gave us our check but then took it back because \"she forgot to add the service fee\" when it was 5 guest but law says it's supposed to be 6+ guest like what. Her service wasn't a 20% tip. Seriously . In conclusion this place is not recommended."

The reg margarita is the best and if you like rum punch, bring a bottle and mix it with the punch.

They have 4 separate rooms to eat in. 2 upstairs and 2 downstairs.  I like the downstairs back room best.\n\nThough the entrees are good, I recommend ordering a bunch of appetizers and share if you are with a group of people.  The queso with mushrooms is amazing! I also enjoy the ceviche and guacamole.  The sopa azteca is good but just know that there is a little spice to it.  I have had the Chuleta Tentacion and Arrechara.

We were all patiently waiting near the entrance awaiting to be seated, after being told multiple times that we had our own separate dining area, and that they'll take care of us soon, blah blah blah. Look I get it, everyone wants to celebrate the holiday so these type of places can get real crowded and rambunctious. But after waiting for ONE HOUR (yes you read that correctly) we were ultimately told that we couldn't be served and seated. How dare that peasent hostess have the absolute audacity, the unmitigated gaw, to tell us that we couldn't be seated after telling us multiple times that we would be catered to. Now this is when things got fiesty, and confrontational. Understandably, we were all furious. I mean half of my friends faces were turning sickeningly pale because of guacamole defiency. When we confronted them in a civil matter, they had the indecency to call the authorities because we were getting \"out of hand\" and speaking in a \"threatening tone.\" We were escorted off the premesis like we were some low-life criminals getting walked back to their cell by a prison guard. Obviously, we took our business elsewhere because they don't deserve a single penny from our wallets. Las Cazuelas, I bet your food tasted like dog crap anyways. Next time, I'd rather celebrate cinco de mayo at Taco Bell than your run down restaurant. Never shall I even have an inkling of a thought to return here, and through multiple means of communication, will relay my horrific experience to hundreds and thousands of people in the Philadelphia area.

        "text": "Went to Las Cazuelas for an early dinner on Saturday with the kiddos. Wife had a groupon which made it a good deal. We started with the ceviche which was composed of two separate ceviches (one shrimp, one tilapia); beautifully ring molded and plated, cured with lime and mixed with diced tomato, cilantro and onion. Perfectly seasoned, tangy, savory and just plain delicious. This might have been the best ceviche I have ever tasted. We almost ordered another one it was soooo good. The kids had the queso fondido app which our server explained wasn't really a fondue, but just melted oaxaca cheese. The kids loved this dish with the gooey, salty, stringy cheese, mopped up with the fresh tortillas. The stringy cheese was a little difficult to work with but made it fun for the kids.\n\nFor my main course I went with the marinated flank steak (arrachera) cooked perfectly medium. I loved the side that came with this dish - some kind of potato \"cake\": a mix of diced potatos, tomatos and seasonings. I thought I tasted saffron, garlic, maybe some type of ancho paste? I dunno, except that it was all delicious... anyway, it was all molded into a perfect round and plated along side the steak and accompanied with black bean soup - also very good. Wife had the seafood enchiladas which were enchiladas stuffed with fresh crab meat and shrimp, topped with a delicious \"seafood\" guacamole. Fabulous. I'm not sure how the chef got this delicious guac to taste like seafood but I suspect he combined the crab \"mustard\" with the avacodo - and man was it good. The kids had chicken quesadillas which they liked and my one daughter had the chicken in mole sauce w/mexican rice and super dark and rich refried beans. I'm generally not a fan of mole as I often find it  too sweet but this one was exceptional; a perfect balance of layered sweet, savory and smoky flavors and just flat out delicious, especially combined with the chicken and those refried beans all in one tasty bite - again maybe the best mole I have ever had. For desert, we shared two pieces of leche cake (one vanilla and one chocolate which was on special). Both were great but I preferred the classic vanilla. \n\nOur servers were really friendly and everything at Las Cazuelas was great. Some might balk at the prices here but this is definitely a few notches above your average Mexican. There are details in the food preparations here that most people might not notice. And just because you're from California or Texas doesn't mean you know what Mexican food is supposed to taste like. Mexican food cannot be generalized that way since it's a very complex country with many regions and influences. The result is a rich tapestry of cultures and add to that the influences and ingredients we can only get here in the northeast. Simply put, the food at Las Cazuelas is excellent and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a little something more than your average taquiera."

Bottom line:  the menu sounds far more interesting than the food actually is, and the prices are more than a little too much for what you get. \n\nThe front of the menu says that the restaurant serves specialties from Puebla, but besides Mole Poblano, there was nothing else that jumped out to me as distinctly Pueblan.  Instead, the menu has quite a few regional specialties from other parts of the country (e.g. Cochinita Pibil from the Yucatan, some dishes from the north, etc.). \n\nThe interesting variety on the menu unfortunately didn't translate to a whole lot of interest on our plates. We ordered a pitcher of pineapple juice, which was solid. Then sopositas--the fried masa cakes were crispy and hot.  Thumbs up. The guacamole was essentially just a pile of avocado chunks, without much of anything else. If you like straight, unadorned avocado (I do) this was fine, though we'd sort of hoped for more flavors. \n\nI ordered a chile relleno as a main course. The chile was just fine, but both the tomato sauce and the black beans and rice that came with the dish were one-dimensional--no spices as far as I could tell, no depth of flavor to speak of.  I will also say that the portions were very modest--a small pool of beans and a tiny little mound of rice. For $16, I would expect either more-than-mediocre flavors, or just more food--but I got neither.  That's enough to make me feel like the dish really came up short. \n\nAnyway, I would consider coming back to try other things on the menu, some of which you really don't find at too many other Mexican places around here. But I'd only go back with lowered expectations, and if I felt like I had money to burn. Which isn't often."

The saving grace was that she noticed that I hated the tacos ilegales and she reordered them made the way I had expected them to come the first time. Separately the meats were moist and hot and good. Together, well refer to my previous comment on the meat. Long story short... we won't be back and I'm pissed at my SIL for suggesting it was anywhere near edible. Also, their mixer and accompanying items for making drinks are practically nonexistent when it comes to making anything other the cheap drink mix margaritas."

There was a cute young couple celebrating the guy's birthday over a bottle of Jose Cuervo (it's BYO), a tipsy Spanish-speaking threesome enjoying what looked to be a tasty appetizer sampler, the Antojitos Rancheros, and drinks, a family with their young baby munching on chips and salsa while his parents sipped on margaritas (apparently they'll make em for you), and 2 girls catching up after work.\n\nOn to the food. I ordered the Arroz con Pollo and it was sooo delicious! The chicken was really tasty, the rice perfectly moist, and the fresh chunks of avocados on top sealed the deal. The side of black bean soup contrasted nicely with the flavorful entree. The serving size was more than plentiful.

After we ordered food, over $100 for an entire family, they were missing two items from the order and when we called to confirm that it wasn't in the bag, we were shot back at with a horrible attitude and they requested that we never order from there again.\n\nWe frequently ordered from them because we absolutely love the food, but their behavior after simply asking about a couple of items was inexcusable. We want to support local restaurants right now, but the fact that they no longer want us to place orders for them just because we asked about a missing item is very childish.\n\nI would think twice about ordering through GrubHub - the drivers cannot open the bags to check the items to stay sanitary, so it wasn't the fault of the driver, but the restaurant."

I especially appreciated that they had to come in and out of our room to run the cash register, and while doing so were consistently helpful, sweet and quick to refill waters and chips/salsa.\n\nThey wouldn't split the check on more than three cards, which is the only reason I've taken off a star; I do understand how obnoxious that is, but it makes it very hard to eat out in large groups at a restaurant, especially when it's a friend's party where you don't know everybody else (so you can't just pay your close friend back later).\n\nThanks for hosting us!

I read alot of the other reviews which were kind of hit or miss experiences but I figured why not. \n\nI found the price tag to be a little steep. Thirteen dollars for three tacos is just short of 5.00 per taco. At least I found the tacos to be generously filled AND there were no extra sauteed onions mixed in the filling, hooray!!!  Just the pork and the pineapple topped with cilantro and raw onion. They didn't throw in those extra little garnishes like the fried jalapeno and the giant scallion thing with the large bulb on the end, not even a damn radish. I missed the jalapeno. I like to cut it up for an extra spicy kick but their salsa which was thicker and hotter than most I've had with this dish, made up for that. As for taste, they were okay. I've had much better at Distrito (who took them off the menu) and Rivera Taco (I left the state of DE)\n\nThere was a lady at the table next to me who raved about their crab enchiladas. She made me promise to try them next and I did on my next visit. I don't usually go for enchiladas. I love the way a griddled or fried tortilla taste and I hate how they get soggy and fall apart in the enchilada style but I did get them. The menu on the window outside said the cost was 20.00 but I was charged 23.00. You get 3 enchiladas covered in a green mole sauce and sprinkled with cheese and red onions ( I took those off ). The sides consisted of veggies that were uninspired julienned strips of squash and boring basic white rice. I would have preferred traditional Mexican rice and black beans to be honest. The filling in this dish was crab (definately canned) and shrimp (definately frozen) but it tasted okay. Not worth the price  I wouldn't get it again and I don't know why the lady who recommended this dish was so into it."

I ended up finding a voucher for this place and I've got to say: if this is what Philly has to offer I want in!\n\nCame here on a Friday night--no reservations, and felt lucky since there were only 2-3 tables that were left open. Appreciated the homie, Mexican feel to the place, definitely reminded me of when I was in the old school town of Mexico. We were led to the upstairs area--which at the time I was hosted a party of 10 of the loudest 20-something year olds celebrating a birthday. We were ok with the deafening noise since we've experienced crazy nights like them before.\n\nMentioned that I had a group-on to whoever sat us down, and she didn't bat an eye lash or stop smiling (so group-on friendly unlike many other places Ive been to). Server came to us immediately with water, chips/salsa and a smile. She remained very attentive during the night even with the amount of tables she had upstairs. (she was a 5 star gem).\n\nWe ordered empanadas, the steak tacos for apps and for entrees Mole Poblano Chicken and the Abuelitas Chicken dish.\n\n-Empanadas were seriously the best I've ever had. The golden outside crust was made to perfection, not oily and greasy, and the chicken inside was seasoned well plus was made with Chipotle sauce. Only two pieces given so share wisely.\n-Steak tacos were also very good, flavorful and tender\n-Mole Pobano--that Mole sauce would make you smack your mamma twice and ask why she never made you Mole sauced chicken. AMAZING.\n-Abuelitas-I bought it because in the menu it talked about the deceased mother's signature dish. It was a tear jerker so I wanted to honor Abuelita Cazuela. It was good but not AH MAZING, only because the chicken breast was a little dry even with the sauce. But the rice and beans were so good.\n\nTHIS IS A BYOB. So we did and we were provided with a cup of ice to add to our drinks.\n\n-Bill came up to $50, $13 group-on knocked off $25, so balance was $25. I enjoyed our waitress so much that I tipped her really well. (I heard her accommodate another party by moving them downstairs after they mentioned how loud that party was).

They put us in the back room next to the kitchen which is a good room for 10 to 20 people.\n\nOur waitress quickly brought us a pitcher of tequila mix. I wasn't planning on drinking the tequila mix and asked if she can bring water for everyone. After 10 to 15 of still no water I asked again and was told there was a glass shortage so they couldn't accommodate water for everyone. I handed them my empty glass and asked the server to fill with water. Strike 1 for no water. There should be no excuse for a restaurant to not at least be able to offer water to everyone. Yes it may be a busy night but purchase more glasses if you run short on busy nights.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the chicken mole enchiladas and I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables.\n\nThe entrees all ran $15 to $18. The mole sauce was gross. My boyfriend will eat anything even cold hot dogs so for him to not like something there  is a problem. The mole sauce was thick and hard to eat. Maybe they used too much chocolate or nuts as I couldn't taste any spices, not that I could taste much of anything in it.\n\nMy shrimp was very average. There was little spice on it and I ordered hot sauce or something spicy on the side. They brought me hot peppers which I loaded into mg entree.\n\nThe chips were fine but both the Verde and red sauces were not spicy and pretty balance.\n\nOn a good note, they do take credit card and decor was nice.\n\nFood was less than average and there's much better Mexican in Philly."

In summary, this was an OVER PRICED and LACKLUSTER meal. \n\nMy boyfriend and I made a spontaneous decision to go here for dinner on a Tuesday night since he came here once and wanted me to try it. Our favorite Mexican food staple is Taco Riendo a couple blocks down from here. This restaurant is very small, less than 10 tables and about 3 are near the door, then the closest table is about 10ft from the kitchen. It's a cozy little restaurant with dark lightning but definitely not a classy vibe. Btw it's BYOB. \n\nThe waitress was very nice and kept checking up on us, service wasn't bad although she was a bit antsy and awkward with conversation lol. Food came out fast, but we were one of two tables there, and the other table already got their food, so I can't really judge on how fast they'll be if they're Busier. Here's where everything goes downhill.\n \nThe table came with free chips and salsa to dip. However, I didn't enjoy the chips at all. They were way too crispy, thin, and had absolutely no flavor, tasted stale almost. I felt as if I was biting on shards. I was very disappointed and waited for the chips that came with the $9 guacamole hoping it'll be better. To my surprise, the guacamole came out ALONE, probably about 6-7 spoonfuls of guac and NO chips. $9!!!!!! Ok at this point I'm expecting banging guac and honestly, this was also very mediocre. I've had better packaged guac from Trader Joe's -.- we also decided to share one Mexican corn, which was $5.5 for a small one. The Mexican corn was mostly sweet, there wasn't really the spicy, sweet, and sour kick I was looking for. At half the price at Taco Riendo, you get a bigger corn that tastes way better!\n\nI am a sucker for platters and I decided on the pork shoulder platter which came with a handful of pork (shredded, and super soft), re fried beans, a tiny bit of rice, and half a plantain. I loved the plantain, but it was so small, there was soooo much meat compared to the rice and the meat was a little too salty to be eating alone. There was like 3 bites of rice before it was gone. $17. Would I get it again? Probably not. Unproportional, overpriced, and mediocre food.\n\nMy bf got the beef tacos and the al pastor tacos; tacos are probably the only thing on the menu that isn't overpriced. However, the taste of these tacos were also mediocre at best, nothing really stood out about them. The sauces weren't good, meat wasn't too flavorful, and the condiments didn't help. \n\nOur total was almost $60 and a good way to put it is that meal did not \"hit the spot.\" I was left feeling empty inside although I was so full. Maybe they were having an off day in the kitchen but the food was so bad. Won't be back :("

They clearly skimped on the number of chips that they gave us as an appetizer. There was more air in our salsa dish than actual salsa. Our appetizer (nachos) came out in the middle of dinner and was lackluster in appearance; it looked like something a 5 year old could make in their microwave. We waited 15 minutes for our margaritas because they somehow ran out of ice and had to send someone to purchase some. We thought it would be a great idea bringing our own tequila to put into their margarita mix, but when we finally got our drinks it was more like tequila on the rocks than a margarita. It was like they were trying to make us drink enough so we wouldn't remember the horrendous service that they were providing. Unfortunately, it didn't work. \n\nThis brings me to the food, which was average at best. It was somewhere between Taco Bell and Chipotle in quality and taste. The sides that were supposed to come with our tacos and burritos never came. Once our meal was over, the waitstaff tried to force us out of the restaurant without giving us our leftover tequila or allowing us time to enjoy the remainder of our tequila lime juice mix. Overall, I would not go back to this restaurant. The silver-lining to the night was that it wasn't too expensive."

The only downside is that the seats are pretty sketchy (dirty looking) and don't represent the restaurant very well."

It was okay. I wish the meats were marinated, or there was some sauce because it seemed a little bland. \nI also had the arroz con pollo. This dish was delicious. Super flavorful and big portions. \nThe waitress had to take care of the whole restaurant. Poor girl was running around the whole night, so we sometimes didn't have water. \nOverall it was a good experience in a family run restaurant. Worth going to once especially if you have the groupon."

We shared the fiesta platter, which included a variety of empanadas, nachos, and flautas and it was a perfect size. The carne asada tacos, served with cilantro and onions, were extremely delicious and also pretty filling. I would also recommend the desserts, the churros and tres leches were excellent. Our server, Shadi, was super personable and seemed to know the menu very well and gave great recommendations, and made our overall experience there pleasant and I would definitely go back!"

It was very inviting and cozy, the music want too loud that you had to talk over the music. I was seated promptly by my waitress Carolynn she attend us quickly and was very attentive the food came out veryquickly and waitress checked in on us constantly. The  food was delicious although I stood wanting more to be honest I wish more would of came with my serving but overall I was happy. \n\nI'd recommend la cazuelas to anyone I know that's looking to eat good food and get equally good service."

Whether I am sitting upstairs or down, there for dinner or brunch, the food is always great and the service is always excellent. It is BYOB and you can bring liquor and they will make the mixed drinks for you, which is really cool.\n\nI have tried a few different items on the menu and here are some highlights; Antojitos Rancheros, the appetizr platter which is large enough to have for a meal and provides a nice selection of items; Mole Poblano; Banana Crepes; Vanilla Tres Leches; Huevos Rancheros; and the Pan A La Francesa.\n\nAlso, they are always on Groupon and LivingSocial, so check out the deals, but be sure to tip you waitstaff well because they do an excellent job."

We split the Queso Fundido with chorizo- it was super creamy and the chorizo was chopped finely which made it blend easily and it wasn't too salty which I find happens often with chorizo. \n\nI got the carnitas tacos (no cilantro) an they were juicy and had crispiness as well and was great with fresh onion and lime. If you are not a big fan of cilantro, my friends had tacos with it on, and they do add a lot! \n\nFinished the night off with some churros and it was perfect!!"

All the other dishes are great too.\n\nOur only complaint is that it looks like this once hole-in-the-wall unknown restaurant is gaining ground and doesn't know how to handle the surge of patrons.  We took my brother and his g/f there, hailing it as the best mexican in the city, and then we had to wait 20 min for our reservation and got our water in coffee mugs because they ran out of glasses.  \n\nSo the food is great and really fairly priced, but be prepared, that if it's busy, service suffers."

        "text": "So I did try las cazuelas, it's a byob Mexican restaurant in Fishtown. I typically go to Sancho pistolas but they were closed for covid and this place is byob! Very small place, you can see into the kitchen and the service was the kindest. She was so helpful with menu suggestions and gearing me away from my indecisiveness. The tostada was really good, but it could've used more sauce to liven it up a bit but still decent. Listen I really wanted to get tacos but she hyped up the pork dish and my friend thankfully got tacos so I was able to try both. Let me tell you the real winner winner pork dinner here is their Cochinita Pibil. The flavor in this dish is unbelievable. You can def tell they took their time and this recipe has been in someone's familia for generations. The tacos were just ok, not as great as sancho pistol-as. However, try the pibil , bring a drink and enjoy being treated like your at the family table. I would go back here for the service and the menu is pretty vast with a lot of home style items. Tacos and void in the tostada aside, it's worth trying out at least once 3.5 out of 5"

The appetizer nachos with chicken were the nights hit. These bad boys were piled mile high and loaded with cheese, beans, sour cream and guac. I could have just eaten the nachos, but being the true fatty I am we all ordered tacos too lol. The table had two orders of the al pastor tacos and I got the shrimp tacos. Everyone shared. Overall the tacos were a solid 3.5/5. My only complaint was that the shells were too soft so the tacos kept falling apart. \n\nI do love that this is a BYO spot. It adds to its charm. Most people order to-go orders. During our time here there was only one other table sitting inside."

Perfect for the drizzly evening my friend and I met up here. The staff was friendly and helpful (thanks for not putting the onions on my tacos!!). They also didn't rush us out once we were done our food. \n\nI inhaled my carnitas tacos as soon as they were in front of me (hence no pictures for this review). They had great flavor and left me feeling satisfied. Have to say the only thing that I was kinda bummed by was the amount of guacamole given for $9. Not sure why my three tacos cost less than a small serving of guac... but the guac was still good!"

However, the food was very meh and things got way worse after I finished my meal and went home.\n\nI came with a friend for lunch. We split an order of the carnitas nachos. I ordered the tacos illegales and my friend ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. The carnitas nachos were really good: covered in cheese and pico de gallo, with a healthy serving of great marinated pork. My tacos (with steak, chicken and chorizo) were unimpressive. The only meat that stood out was the chorizo; the steak and chicken were pretty bland and forgettable. Also, they only use one tortilla for each taco, so grease was seeping through and dripping all over my hands by the time I got to my third taco.\n\nThis is where things get gross: an hour or two after eating, I felt shooting pains in my gut. I immediately had to rush home to the bathroom and experienced a bad case of the runs. I didn't eat anything prior to lunch besides two waffles. Still, unsure if it was for sure the food that made me poop my brains out, I consulted with my friend. He too had gone through the same experience after I dropped him off.\n\nPoint is, don't come here unless you're looking for unexciting Mexican food that might leave you running for the toilet a couple hours after your meal."

And then I was like, \"You bring the tequila and they make margaritas for you?\" So I turned my frown upside down and kept an open mind. \nLas Cazuelas was a nice surprise for this street taco snob...Not only is this place fun and kitchy, the food and drinks are really good....I mean, mole poblano is not always good, or even decent, but at Las Cazuelas, it was good!  So were the very crisp chips, and the perfectly ripened and seasoned guacamole.  Wow!  Impressed.\nWhat was probably the MOST impressive at Las Cazuelas was the service.  We had really nice and attentive staff that kept our group of 22+ happy.  I wish I remembered our main servers name (young, tall, beard) because he was so professional and enthusiastic.  He was on point the whole night, and that was not easy to do.  \nOverall, a solid, casual and fun place with good food and you BYOB...what's not to like?"

The space is small, dark, and intimate- perfect for a date night, not so great for a group dinner.\n\nOur waitress was so sweet and accommodating, & happily gave us extra chips and salsa and tortillas when we ran out. She also expertly mixed the tequila we brought with their homemade margarita mix.\n\nTwo of us shared chorizo queso fundido, nachitos and steak fajitas. Loved it all. The queso fundido was SO good- just make sure to eat it all before it cools down. Love that the fajitas come with rice and beans, also. \n\nWe were able to use a Groupon and get out of there for under 20 bucks, including tip. Would highly recommend and will definitely return, with or without a Groupon!"

Yikes!\n\nWe wanted to grab dinner before a Yelp Event so I purchased a Groupon and came here. I would have been really pissed had I paid \"real\" money for the sham of a taco they served. \n\nFirst, the restaurant is extremely small. Probably about 12 tables total and super close together. Usually small means intimate but its small and very loud. So small that you almost knock a table over that's sitting close to the entrance. However, they do have outside seating. \n\nWe ordered a guacamole and two orders of Cancun Tacos which were made with tilapia, chipotle mayo, pickled onions and cilantro. \n\nThe guacamole was $9!!!! We ate about 3 chips apiece and it was gone. The portion was very small and needed to be salted. Plain and just overall blah. For nine smackers, I want a bowl not a couple of spoonfuls. Ugh. \n\nThe tacos took about a half hour to get to the table. The fish was overcooked, had a microwaved taste to it. Almost as if it were yesterdays fish and someone reheated it and threw crap on them. The tacos were soft so with all the goop thrown on top, you had to eat them with a fork. Yuck. Wet and soggy tacos. Disgusting. \n\nWe were asked if we liked everything and we didn't. I tried to finish my plate. Tamar had hers replaced with a $6 ear of Mexican corn . Overpriced in my opinion. I didn't see anything else on the menu that I wanted so I just didn't finish it. \n\nBland food, slow service and too small of a restaurant makes an unhappy customer."
