Okay, arrived at 7 pm with reservations and was seated in the dungeon. Fine. We ordered queso fundido with chorizo and got a weird looking cheese skillet with tortillas NOT chips. Odd! So had to ask for chips. Should've asked for a trash can. So we asked for some salsa to dress it up a bit -- that took an hour and I'm not exaggerating! The salsa was a thick mushy mess. Could turn the bowl upside down and nothng would've come out. Our food took an hour and a half, too. By that time, we were full on chips -- which were the only good thing on the menu! Oh... My favorite part... I ordered a side of beans and rice to go with my carne asada tacos -- which were more like unseasoned beef tips -- and I got a bowl of hard WHITE rice with refried beans on top. WHITE rice??? Seriously?!\n\nTerrible! Dont waste your time. Taco Bell serves better food than this and that isn't saying much! Service was just as bad!!"

From 10-12 on Saturdays (and maybe Thursdays and Fridays as well?) they have a late night happy hour.  The special was $5 house margaritas.  While that may not sound like the most amazing deal to happy hour cheapskates, trust me - it is.  Sauza blanco, hand-squeezed lime juice, and simple syrup made for a tasty drink.  I like when you can actually taste the tequila in a 'rita.\n\nWhile we weren't here for a full meal, we did try a few of the snacks:\n\n-queso fundido: Delicious melted chihuahua cheese, served with piping hot fresh tortillas, mushrooms, pickled red onions, and peppers. I really loved those red onions.  I could bring home a jar of those.\n-the chicharrones: pork rinds served with a dangerously spicy salsa verde.  Again, amazing.\n\nService was attentive and friendly, and a DJ was spinning hip hop and funk.  I had a really great time here, and have to come back for a full dinner."

They rarely visit so picking an awesome restaurant- a task assigned to me as the Philly resident- was very important. \n\nXochitl did not disappoint. The vibe is understated Old City- totes relaxing, trendy but traditional, doesn't take itself too seriously but your server knows everything about the menu and food and drink is masterfully executed. \n\nThe guacamole was fantastic (if it wasn't, I wouldn't even bother to post a review...) which is a basic requirement for Mexican restaurants. Check. \n\nSince we were feeling poor that night, my fianc\u00e9 and I went with tacos rather than a full-on entree. Fish tacos-can you make them spicy? Um, yeah.  Melt in your mouth. Spicy brisket tacos- also very tasty. There were no leftovers. Our server and bartender colluded to prepare a dessert drink for us, a little shot of tiramisu liqueur goodness. And it was perfect. \n\nI still can't say the name of this place correctly but I will definitely be back and I would recommend it to others. Mexican food done right is such a treat, and so nice to find in a fun place that has cool staff who can really deliver for a semi special occasion. \n\nWhen I go back.

It was the perfect atmosphere and food in the downstairs lounge area. The music the dj was playing was great and funky, yet not too loud, so that we could still hold a conversation. The food was spectacular, we had the Ceviche de Callos con Sandia (watermelon and scallop ceviche), I wasn't sure what to expect, it was not like the typical ceviche I have had before, but it was delicious. We also had the Queso Fundido, one with chorizo and the other with mushrooms. They were both devine!\n\nThey also have a reverse happy hour special in the lounge: Thursday - Saturday, 10pm-12am. We had some tasty margaritas (although not the best I have had, but good enough for the price), and we were feeling really nice by the time we left there, not too full, it was the perfect amount of food, and we still had some $ in our pocket!\n\nI am definitely looking forward to going back to Xochitl."

However, the Shrimp Chile Nogada was just ok (wouldn't order again) and they make the WORST basic margaritas I have ever had. I realize margaritas aren't exactly old world Mexico and authentic to the culture pre mid 1930's or 40's, but if you are going to taut your margs, at least try.

YES. \n\nxochitl, the RESTAURANT you go to for an impressively cooked meal that is worth the somewhat overpriced expense for mexican food ... NOT SO MUCH.  \n\nthey do serve some of the finest margaritas in the city. they are, as rumored, strong and should be consumed with caution. and the guac, though very high at $9, is incredible. each table has a guac card that you can use to customize the ingredients you'd like to add to your guac, including jalapenos, garlic, tomatoes, peppers, oaxaca, and so many other things. i only say that it's steep at $9 because you don't get much in quantity, but it's fair considering the cost of avocados. \n\nthe food was quite the disappointment.  years ago (before the menu revamp), the food was incredible. i still remember one of the duck entrees i had there as being the best duck i have ever eaten. HOWEVER, the same cannot be said now.  \n\nwe had 2 people in our group order the $26 braised short rib. and they did not even finish it. the meat was dry and a bit bland -  totally tragic. \n\nthe rest of our table had tacos - the carne asada, the carnitas and the fish. these were solid. honestly, there wasn't anything to complain about, but they weren't particularly memorable either. \n\nthe tacos ranged from $13-16 and included 3 tacos. of the ones we tried, i'd say the fish tacos were my favorite. \n\nthis is the upside though. considering the dearth of options fish taco lovers have in this city, if you're having a serious fish taco craving, xochitl is a reliable bet. the fish is not breaded/fried and it tastes very fresh, citrusy and the slaw gives it great crunch."

Our server was very eager and a little awkward, but at least the effort was there. \n\nWe started with the guacamole made table-side, which was delicious and fresh. We also had the queso fundido with chorizo and it was addictive! \n\nThe entrees were a let down, however and that is why I cannot give more stars. At fairly steep prices, compared to apps, I expected greatness. We had the fried chicken with rice and it was bland atop some gummy rice concoction. Just meh. We also had a seafood special that was equally uninspired. \n\nI agree with Meghan C. that the margaritas do pack a punch and they are not too sweet, which was good for me. They also have some great Mexican beers on draft - my husband enjoyed a few Negro Modelos. \n\nOverall, I think this would be a great place for drinking and snacking, but the entrees are to be missed."

        "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for some good Mexican food for his birthday, and since I missed the boat on getting a reservation at El Vez I figured we would give this a try. The reviews seemed okay and everyone said that the drinks were really good. \n\nNot at all true....\n\nTo start with, we ordered the guacamole. I have had a lot of different kinds and make it myself at home, and this was incredibly bland with not a lot of flavor.  I ordered the Carnitas Tacos and my boyfriend got the Brisket Tacos (special of the day). They were all right, but the waiter told us right off the bat he would recommend a side since they were small portions.  We didn't end up eating any of our side since they were so big, we each only finished two tacos! \n\nThe most disappointing part of this whole experience was the drinks.  I got the Classic Mojito (which I have also had and made many times before) and he got the Mexican style Mojito, that apparently is with cilantro and tequilla instead of rum and mint.  The first batch were really delicious, so we ordered another round. Not at ALL the same drink.  They looked very different, but mainly they didn't taste at all similar.  Very very sweet and acidic, way too bitter.  We politely called the waiter over and asked if the bartender wouldn't mind remaking them since the first drinks we had were very different, and he obliged. A few seconds later the bartender came back and told us she remade the drinks but tasted them and they tasted exactly how they should be.  She was very condescending and rude (My boyfriend and I have both worked in customer service before...when customers are being polite in their complaints, there is no need to be rude back) and said she would make the drink for us 10 times if we wanted but it wouldn't be any different. She said that they first AMAZING drink we had must have been made wrong.  She kept asking us how they were different and we had trouble explaining to her exactly what to change, so we decided to let it go and asked for the check. Yes, we still got charged for the shitty drinks that we left on our table. \n\nFor a tequilla bar who is apparently known for their drinks, the inconsistency is frightening.  I was very disappointed in the entire experience, not what I was planning for the first birthday that my boyfriend and I spent together."

Not the end of the world, partially our fault. \n\nMoving on.\n\nThe quacamole was so buttery! We just ordered it sort of plain with jalapenos, cilantro and tomatoes. \n\nI got the empanada app which was very good. The chicken inside had a lot of flavor and the crust was perfectly crusty. I got the short ribs for my main and forgive me because I forget what it came with, but everything was good. Definitely a solid three for the dinner.\n\nThe dessert was just weird. I wanted to be adventurous. But I guess sweet/spicy sauce and chocolate just don't do it for me. I took one taste of the chocolate tart and instantly wanted to vomit. That has never happened to me before and I was embarassed by my poor choice!!!

        "text": "Xochitl is located in Society Hill, on a super pretty brick street. The picturesque street is an ideal location for this intimate space. The restaurant  has a fabulous bar, with a daily happy hour (including $6 margaritas) at the bar. There is a a sunken dining room with lots of wooden tables and warm colors.\n\nThe service is great, and the staff is very friendly. I've also heard great things about the Molcajete Dinner for 2, which is available Sunday-Thursday, and includes make your own tacos of various proteins.\n\nWe started the meal with some customized Guacamole ($9). Each table in the dining room is set with a guacamole form and pencil in order to complete a checklist of ingredients and mix ins. We chose to have ours made with cilantro. chipotle, cotija cheese, plum tomato, and roasted garlic. The guacamole comes to the table in a heaping bowl with a sprinkling of cotija cheese resembling snow on top. The guacamole has a nice briny taste, along with a pop of citrus, offsets the saltiness. It's very creamy, but still has the house made chunky consistency. There's an aftertaste of spicy heat without too much of a bite. Instead there's a building heat from the more mild chipotle pepper, and freshness from the cilantro. The fresh plum tomato gives a nice chewy change from the creaminess of the avocado on alternating bites, and the house made  tortilla chips gave a great crunch. Great way to start off the meal!\n\nMy friend ordered the Ahi Tuna Ceviche ($12) as her main meal. The ahi tuna itself was super fresh, sliced very thin, and came dressed in a citrus and guajillo chili marinade. The tuna is garnished with some micro cilantro and cucumber. The dish had a subtle heat from the guajillo chilis and a punch of flavor from the marinade, which was refreshing and helped cut through the richness of the avocado and cheese. The dish only came with three yucca chips, but there were plenty of leftover chips from the guacamole to scoop up the rest of the tuna.\n\nI opted for a far less healthy, but super delicious entree choice - the Pollo Frito ($23). I ordered the half a chicken portion that was cut into four individual pieces with a sweet and spicy chili sauce drizzle. The three day preparation, including brining, steaming and frying, gave the chicken a nice crispy skin, but kept the meat especially moist. The chili drizzle did not detract from the crispness of the skin, and actually highlighted the juiciness of the meat.\n\nThe dish is usually accompanied with corn bread and chipotle creamed spinach. The spinach is somewhat liquidy from the cream without being watery. In addition, the spinach has a pleasant heat and is a great rendition of a classic dish. This time I decided to substitute esquites, or Mexican street corn, in place of the spinach. The esquites complemented the cornbread nicely, and the corn was not overcooked. It maintained a small bit of crunch, and an overall richness from the cream, and a subtle background like flavor. of lime. There was no overt heat in the corn, which was a bit of a relief from the spiciness of the meal. The corn had an amazingly addictive quality to it though, and made me come back more and more. The dusting of cotija on top was a nice garnish. The cornbread had chunks of fresh corn throughout, and generous pad of melted butter. It came out as an individual loaf--freshly baked and hot from the oven.\n\nXochitl has a great vibe--perfect for an intimate dinner or a group night out. Next time Im there, I'm going to try the Chocolate Tres Leches Cake--as long as I have enough room left in my stomach!"

From the start our waitress was a bit off. She didn't know the size of the signature drinks (one would assume the $10 drink might be smaller than the $28 one. But it might just be the liquor). After we decided on our food, we were told the items we were considering were sold out (would of been nice to not get our hopes set and then be told it was sold out). Ordered the custom guacamole and red snapper ceviche. The guacamole is the only thing that made this review a 2 star review. I've made ceviche many times before. There was a very strong fish taste that not the guacamole, drinks or my entree could remove. Even as I write this I feel like I licked fish scales. GF got the salad which was bleh, dressing was bland. I got the short rib tacos. Short rib tasted like they took it out of a pot roast dish (no mexican seasoning) and the taco was impossible to hold as it was just too wet with the corn/cream topping. Our waitress never once came over to ask how the apps or even the entree were. But again, guacamole was good, if that's all you're looking for."

Chunky, delicious, and it's got a little bit of a kick to it if you let them add the red peppers (you can always request that they leave them out, but they don't make the guac overwhelmingly spicy).   \n\nIf you're getting guac anyway (and why wouldn't you?), note that the \"El Sabor\" special is offered daily, and it's a steal as long as the entire table has enough of an appetite for it. For $32, each person gets the guac, along with an appetizer and an entree (no menu item off limits). We weren't hungry enough to for it when we came, but the next time I know I'm coming to Xochitl, I'll try to plan ahead a little better to take advantage of this prix fixe option. \n\nFor an entree, I got the Salmon marinated in achiote (a reddish seed with a bit of an earthy flavor) served over poblano crema,fava beans, and yuca tots. The fish was perfectly cooked... juicy but with a little bit of crispiness on the outside, and everything else was also tasty. \n\nAlas, I wish I had saved room for dessert. But there are several reasons to go back again, so perhaps I'll get to try the Postres another time."

Get a seat at the bar if you're into the drinks, for there is no wait-service downstairs and the bar is smaller than my closet. So, unless you play Center for the Sixers, you're gonna wait to get a drink downstairs.\n\nI recommend a 'flight' of Tequilas. Ask the bartender for advice if needed, they know what they're talking about here. \n\nBeen here when its empty and bar is to ourselves, and on a busy Sat night..opt for the prior if you can.

Walking in the receptionist wss very nice and sat us right away.   Unfortunately the table was so small it left me wondering how we would fit any of our plates on it.  The devote was nice and had a rustic feel.  I ordered the fish tacos with a side of rice & beans. My s/o ordered the steak or perhaps the beef tacos ( I cant remember the name). The food presentation was very nice but there was very little food which would have been ok it it was offset by big flavor.   However, the food was bland and needed salt among other spices.

Their happy hour runs from 5-7 and offers half-priced margaritas and beer specials.\n\nI am a big fan of guacamole and Xochitl's is fresh which is a major plus in my book and has the right amount of lime and cilantro which a lot of places get wrong.  When I was in there last they had some sort of delicious cabbage stuffed enchilada dish but I don't see it on the current menu.  My dining partner had the goat dish and thought it was awesome and we shared the Sopa Azteca and it was quite good.  It's not cheap mexican but if you're looking for amazing food and drinks in a great, comfy atmosphere I would definitely check out Xochitl!"

        "text": "This was hands down one of the worst dining experiences that I've ever had in Philadelphia.  Ultimately, Xochitl gets one star because I do not have a \"no star\" option.  My friend and I dined here last night for restaurant week and had really been looking forward to it.  Neither of us had been before, so we thought Philadelphia's Restaurant Week would be a great place to give it a shot.  WRONG.\n\nWe arrived on time for our 7 pm reservation and were asked to wait in the bar area until our table was ready.  Not a problem.  And understandable on a Friday evening. Although the restaurant was not at capacity we didn't think twice about being asked to wait. About five minutes later, we were seated and our very nice server came to explain the menu and the customizable guacamole.  \n\nWe made our guacamole selection and placed the order for the remainder of our 3 courses.  As far as the food goes, the guacamole was the best thing we had.  I ordered sangria that was supposed to have peaches, but instead had grapes and apples.  I'm not saying that's impermissible, but it's totally different.  Lol.  Just saying.\nAnyway, from there, the courses went down hill.  The four cheese empanadas were a bit undercooked.  My main course, which the waitress described as their signature dish, was ok but did not make a real impression.  And the dessert....the churros.  I thought that was a safe choice.  WRONG.  They're probably normally excellent, but when I bit into it instead of the lovely, sugary sweetness that I was expecting, I tasted onion and garlic and lots of other savory spices.  Perhaps they had a shortage of oil in the kitchen.  Who knows?  \n\nBUT HERE'S THE REAL PROBLEM: Our waitress brought us the bill and we were winding down when the manager, Adam, came over to our table and said, \"ladies, I hope you've enjoyed yourselves and that you will come again.  If you'd like to continue enjoying yourself, I suggest you go to the bar, but we need the table.\"  Now is probably when I should point out that there were other vacant tables in the dining room and that the couple next to us was in the process of leaving, But I digress.  Apparently there was some special reason why he needed our table.  So we proceed to stare at him like he was crazy.  He took that as his cue to continue talking.  He said, \"we've been TRYING TO WORK AROUND YOU, but you've been here for THREE HOURS and we need the table.\"  We had not been there for three hours, it was slightly over two, and it was a four course meal. Moreover, we had to wait for our table.  Ultimately, however, if their primary concern is just turning tables and not providing a nice dining experience, then they shouldn't be in the restaurant business, nor should they participate in Restaurant Week.  \n\nWhen we started gathering our belongings, my friend asked the manager to move because he was blocking her chair.  After which he said, \"I don't allow people to talk to me like that.\"  This was unbelievable.   I have never been treated so poorly by a staff member at a restaurant...EVER.  I would not be able to recommend this establishment to my worst frenemy."

At that point every table was available, but there were reservations for them.  \n\nThis was our first trip back to Xochitl since they re-did the menu.  We had only been once and thought the food was pretty good, so we were expecting even better.\n\nAfter a few house margaritas at the bar, the bartender gave us a heads up that happy hour was over in 1 minute if anyone wanted a refill.  We thought that was pretty nice of her.\n\nThe four of us split 2 apps, which was enough food to whet our appetites before the main course.  The girls got fish tacos, the boys got pulled pork tacos and everyone shared.  After dinner we shared the churros which were not as good as I remember, though still good.\n\nAfter we paid the check, the bartender offered us a free round of tequila shots before heading out - a great end to a great meal.  We left with enough food (but not too much) and a nice buzz.  I would go there again in a second."

The portion size is admirable but the guacamole was basically bland despite the additions you can select.  Chips were crisp and tasty though.  We order Tamales which were very disappointing.  The masa needed salt and the fillings are served along side the tamale, as a restaurant means not to have to make four kinds of tamales.  The mushroom mix was bitter tasting.  The pulled pork was dry and flavorless.   I also ordered a Gin and tonic (a pretty weak pour) and when I tried to order another drink they said they were out of gin.

The guacamole was fresh, flavorful and presented nicely.  You can order it with your own selection of ingredients, however, I went with the traditional.   My favorite was the tacos. Very flavorful and well done. Tender shredded pork finish fried to a crisp, served on corn tortillas with onions.   I would definitely go back for the tacos alone.  They were somewhat small so I did order a second helping.  The place does have all the right ingredients to be a local hot spot for modern Mexican.  The bar is very nice and the barman was extremely friendly and accommodating, although I do forget his name.  The margaritas were fabulous, they fresh squeeze the lime juice for each order, they were the best i've had outside of Mexico itself.  \n\nI would certainly return again and recommend it to friends."

Flavorless pre-made guacamole in a tiny bowl.  i've been robbed less at overpriced restaurants in manhattan.  what really got me was that it turned brown by the time we were down to the last chip (tops 10 minutes).  pampano, mama mexico, even dos caminos makes fresh guac at your table to order.  are you serious \"So-Cheet\"?  within the first 20 minutes of being at this restaurant, i can understand why they did an opentable spotlight.\n\nThe housemade chips aren't overly greasy and they're the perfect thickness, but is all that salt necessary?\n\nThe mushrooms in the tamale were tasty, but I thought the strong cheese didn't fit in, I could barely taste the pasilla chile gravy or house crema, so I can't say they added much.\n\nExtremely dry, tough and tasteless short ribs--maybe this was the \"lean kind\" but it was really really dry/tough.  the golden potato gordita was great, but the roasted garden veggies were soggy, soaking in sauce, and just as uninteresting as the short ribs.\n\nCompletely dry and tasteless chicken (the special \"pollo frito\")--$25 for a half-chicken, are you serious?!  i made a more tender chicken breast on a fry pan the other night.  (entrees were $30 post-tax across the board--at those prices, I'd go to one of the amazing BYOs Philly offers)  24-hour brined does not make dry chicken!!!\n\nThe doughnuts were an incredible disappointment.  the chocolate sauce and whatever fruity sauce (they called it strawberry) they brought out seemed like they came out of a can and a film formed on the top of the chocolate almost instantly.  they should learn a thing or two from the stanton social.\n\nI would give this place 2 stars but for the fact that the service was pretty terrible despite the very nice disposition of the waitress.  finished glasses and plates were not taken away unless we stacked them on top of each other and placed literally on the edge of the table.  the restaurant was hardly full so there was no excuse.  i specifically asked for no salt on my margarita, but surprise surprise, it came with salt.  my friend's first drink of the night never got cleared from the table--with 4 people at the table, are...you...for real?  i can appreciate paying happy hour prices for these drinks, but aside from the fresh ingredients like lemons, limes, mint, truly nothing to warrant the $10-15 cocktails (the cocktails go up in price from there).  the flights of tequila we tried were delicious but they could not make up for the fact that the food sucks.  sorry for the bluntness."

I was excited to see that the guacamole was made tableside, not scooped out of a plastic tub into a bowl and brought to the table.  It is also great that you can control the heat and cilantro and onion content of the guac to your own personal preference.  This was a nice touch to have personalized guacamole.  My girlfriend loves gaucamole, so this was like heaven for her.  We agreed that it was probably the best that we had ever had.  It was so fresh.  It was literally straight out of the avocado shell and into our mouths.\n\nThe entrees themselves were also very good, but less memorable than the gauc.  I had the baby back ribs.  although they had a nice smokey flavor, I prefer a baby back rib with a nice caramelized sheen on it instead of a really moist and thick rib.  Don't get me wrong, they were very good.  I've just had better.\n\nI was comparing this place to Lolita.

        "text": "Tucked into a small storefront on Headhouse Square at Second and Lombard, just off of South Street and next to the Artful Dodger, you'll find Xochitl, one of Philly's hottest new restaurants.  Xochitl, pronounched \"so-sheet,\" is named after an ancient Aztec queen, and I can only describe the fare as Latin American fusion.  And it is to-die-for.\n\nI recommend starting your meal with the fresh guacamole made right at your table.   It is the single most delicious guacamole you will ever eat, and you will find yourself scraping the bottom of the bowl in order to get every last scrap of it.  At least that's what I did.  Following the guacamole and chips, I highly recommend the scallops and watermelon ceviche, which is on permanent special.  While the combination of watermelon with shellfish may sound unusual, I guarantee that the thinly sliced scallops placed atop fresh, sweet watermelon and topped with microgreens will be the most unexpected and heavenly flavor combination that you've ever tasted.\n\nOnce you've recovered from the mouth-watering appetizers, you will find that the entrees are just as delightful.  All of the varieties of ceviche served at Xochitl are delicious, and I especially liked their ceviche tostadas.  Another scrumptious dish is the poblano pepper stuffed with ground meat and topped with a vanilla walnut sauce.  If you prefer something else, Xochitl's menu is packed with creative concoctions featuring seafood, chicken, goat meat, and other proteins with spicy vegetable combinations.  The entire menu is featured online at www.xochitlphilly.com, except for the specials, so you can even make your decision before you arrive.\n\nIf you still have room for dessert after your meal, you will have difficulty choosing just one item from the dessert menu.  I was too stuffed when I went there, so I opted for the Mexican hot chocolate, which was rich, creamy, and had the slightest hint of some sort of pepper.  My boyfriend and I were there for my birthday, and I suppose that I confounded his plans because I ordered hot chocolate instead of a solid dessert, but the waitress was so sweet that she stuck a lit birthday candle onto the hot chocolate's saucer.  If that's not personalized service, I don't know what is!\n\nIn addition to the wonderful food, Xochitl also serves a variety of tequilas and other drinks that you will find appealing.  The tequilas are their specialty, and you can order a sampler flight of three from their extensive tequila menu.  You can also order tequila in cucumber shot glasses.  They also have margaritas, Mexican beer, and other alcoholic beverages.  My favorite drink, however, is their slightly sweet hibiscus-infused water.  If you are adventurous, I suggest their spicy beer concoction, which mixes beer with tomato juice and other spices.\n\nFinally, Xochitl's charming atmosphere and decor combines with its menu to make it one of the hippest new restaurants in Philly.  The cozy upstairs features a full bar area and a dining area, complete with the type of candle-lit decor one might imagine is featured in the old grand haciendas of Zorro's days.  If you go downstairs, you'll find another full bar and charming lounge area, where you can order drinks and food, and the entire atmosphere there is reminiscent of being on a starlight veranda.  The walls are a deep blue, the lighting is low, the couches are comfy, and candlelight twinkles off of mirrors all around you.\n\nI highly recommend making reservations if you intend to go for dinner because seating in the dining area is limited, and this place is becoming ever more popular by the minute.\n\nIn all, I would say this is one place that  everyone in Philadelphia ought to try.\n\nUPDATE:  I've been here several times now, and I love this place more and more.  Everything I've had is always perfect, so I'm convinced the chef is a genius.  They also often run specials, like 4-course meals for $35.  The most recent special is the Frida Kahlo menu, which will run until the Frida show at the Art Museum closes on May 18, and which features recipes stolen from Frida's own recipe box (and, I'm sure, improved by the chef - it was all amazingly delicious).  Seriously, the chef there has a real knack for creating perfectly balanced dishes with delicate flavors and mind-blowing delectability.  Take, for example, some of his soups, which come with the ingredients in the bowl, and the broth is poured in at the table, with fresh onions and cilantro on the side.  Pure heaven."

The hostess seemed very pleased to turn me away and tell me there wouldn't be a table for about 4 hours. I didn't like the attitude, as I'd experienced it before. No one wants to be turned away from their favorite places, and even a fake \"I'm sorry\" would have been a better answer."

There is a card on the table that allows you to pick various add-ons to thier Guac base (avacado, lime, cilantro salt and pepper) We added raw garlic, plum tomatoes, raw onions (For free) and then added some items that cost $1.00/item corn and pomegranate, on top of all that we also were given the ability to control the spiceness so naturally we chose habenero because for some strange reason I like to sweat and itch my head while I eat.\n\nOn top of the guac we ordered a ceviche plate which was good but not great, I feel ceviche is all about the fish the ceviche here seemed like the fish was the secondary ingredient. We also ordered fish tacos and chicken tacos which were both phenomenal!! Can't say enough of the marinades on both the chicken and fish! \n\nAll in all we had a great dinner, only word of caution is that this place can get heavy on the wallet if you're not careful on how you order."

I wouldn't expect this though, I think we were just lucky. Wait staff and hosts are so friendly and the food is good too! I have had the chicken and rice and the salmon. The salmon was wonderful! The margaritas are a little too stiff, but that's not a deal breaker and my husband had the michelada, which was really great and different."

Usually my husband and I avoid busy restaurants on Fridays and Saturdays and opt for a Thursday date night, we have also sworn off Valentine's Day and any other amateur hour/prix fixe/everyone is out type of night. We were still clinging to restaurant week, but have been let down on so many occasions.  Bummer. \n\nWe started off with drinks, and there is something off about the drinks here. I can't place it, but they just taste awful, and we had three different drinks. The worst was the blood orange martini. It tasted so flat and bland and almost watered down. The Pepino, the jalape\u00f1o/cucumber/basil beverage should have been packed with flavor, but fell flat with just heat and little actual taste. It was the best of the three. I then tried the cherry grand marnier drink, can't remember the name as recommended by the manager--again it fell flat and though it had been described to me as \"sweet\" it was not at all. I could taste the alcohol hardcore, but little else. I suspect they are using low quality tequilas and charging top shelf prices, but that's just my theory. \n\nWe placed our order-- guac that we customized, cheese empanadas, mexican flatbread, two vegetable sopas and the churros and chocolate tres leches cake for dessert. Our guac arrived and again, I only tasted the heat of the habanero that we had requested. We also asked for spanish onions, roasted garlic and tomatoes. I have made better guacamole whilst drunk. BLAND city. I even squeezed a lime in it form my drink to brighten the flavor, nothing. It was also way too smooth, like they had a vat of pureed avocado in the back and were just adding things in quickly. The chips also needed more salt. \n\nNext, we received our entrees instead of our apps. When the guy (not our waiter) put them down in front of us we were all \"nope, didn't get apps yet\" and he was all ok, bye and left the entrees there. Uh what? The manager did come over and apologize and offer us a free drink for the mistake, encourage us to eat meal in reverse. We did, and it kind of ruined the whole night since we filled up like crazy on the heavy entree. We then waited quite some time for our apps. The empanadas were the only amazing part of the meal. The flatbread had an odd mouthfeel to it, was greasy and again lacked flavor. We waited awhile again for our desserts and our waiter was mostly MIA for the entire meal.  Finally dessert. The churros were not fully cooked. The oil was obviously too hot because they outsides were crispy and brown, but they were pure uncooked batter inside. Gross. This was confirmed by the table next to us, as theirs were also partially raw. The cake was yummy. Subpar meal, bad drinks, kind of crappy service. I did appreciate the effort from the manager, but he has some work to do. Wish I'd tried this place before it changed hands."

We got there for dinner around 9ish or so and sat down.  What struck me about the place was how much effort they put into their drinks, particularly their tequila selection (the waitress reminded me multiple times they were a tequila bar).  It's a shame that they don't put nearly as much effort into the food.  But when your bar area is about the same size as your dining room, go figure.\n\nWe started with an order of guacamole with housemade chips, the red snapper ceviche, and the queso fundo with chorizo.  First off, the guac is hideously expensive ($9 or upwards for a relatively small dish).  The design-your-own format is creative, but open to some pretty expensive and awful combinations (bleu cheese and crab?  really?)  The ceviche was messy and clunky to eat; the fish was still in really large chunks, so it was awkward when I tried to bring some over to my plate and didn't expect to be reaping such a large piece of fish.  The queso fundo was good, but kind of messy to eat as well.  Also, I didn't realize the chorizo was served ground; I would have preferred small cubed chunks or bigger pieces.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the steak tacos, which looked nice but like the other dishes, was poorly executed.  There was simply too much meat on the small corn tortillas, and I ended up dripping steak juice all over my hands while I tried to eat the tacos.  He got the deconstructed short rib tamale, which looked and tasted way better than my high-end tacos.  Served as a fork-and-knife dish, it was also less messy and awkward to eat and enjoy\n\nOverall, I thought the food was just ok.  Everything tasted pretty good, but there needs to be more thought put into how the dishes are going to be eaten, not just how they look or taste.  Not even my margarita, which was really damn delicious, could save this dinner or my chances of returning any time soon.  Also, thank goodness we had the Groupon because otherwise this meal would have been way overpriced."

Not the case! We stumbled upon Xochitl and my boyfriend remembered hearing good things about it so in we went. We barely waited 3 minutes before being seated. Pretty decent given the circumstances. As it was restaurant week, Xochitl had a fixed 4 course menu at $35 a person. The meal started off with a customizable guacamole (we added red onion, roasted garlic, and cilantro) so yummy and the tortilla chips were perfectly crisp with just enough saltiness. Then on to the first course: we chose the cheese filled empanadas and some type of flat bread with mushrooms and cheese. I must admit that though good, the first courses were a tad bland. For example the flat bread could have used a little squeeze of citrus. For main courses, I ordered the short rib (served with a potato gordita and roasted veggies) and bf ordered the pollo frito (served with cornbread and greens) at the waiter's recommendation. The short rib was fantastic, perfectly glazed and tender but the potato and veggies were alittle lacking. I can't comment on the pollo frito but the cornbread it was served with was the best I've had yet. For dessert, we ordered the flan and doughnuts (served with both chocolate and strawberry dipping sauces). Both were very good. I also cannot comment on the drinks but if I visit again, I will most definitely give them a try. If you haven't been to Xochitl, I recommend giving it a go."

You do know it's restaurant week, right?\" When I then stated that of course I knew it was restaurant week and reminded her that our bill was almost $600 and asked if she could at least check to see if they had an extra chair, she responded \"Your reservation was only for 10 people. We don't have any extra chairs.\" Meanwhile, a table across from us and a ton of bar chairs were open. Our friend shared a chair with one of us until we were finished dessert. My friends were disgusted by this hostess. She had a horrible attitude.

Its an amazing, flavorful and rich addition that you have to try!  Then I usually get cheese, cilantro, tomatoes and several other small additions!

Oh yeah, you can also get 1/2 priced food from the late night menu in the lounge after 10pm.  So It's another late night happy hour.  I've tried Steven Starr's same type of deal at Jones but that's like slumming it compared to Steven Cooks menu at Xochitl.\n\nMy friend and I arrived hungry and thirsty, which meant we were gonna spend money regardless of the price.  We drank a few house margaritas each after a round of beers.  The main bartender in the lounge was working like crazy because this place was packed.  There were also people drinking while waiting for a place to sit.  We sat at the bar which probably was a good bet.  Drinks taste better when you see just how generous a pour they give you with the booze. [sigh]\nAgreeing to split all the food we ordered, we started with an order of the Lamb tacos which were very delicious and a decent portion compared to the Sopes (Duck, goat cheese and chorizo on fresh masa tortillas with black beans) which tasted great but mini tapas sized and the same price.  I probably wouldnt order the Sopes again.  We ordered the  frise' salad that had duck and cinnamon smoked figs and blue cheese.  Yeah, the ingredients read as culinary porn for sure but the portion wasn't porn sized, if you know what I mean. (do I need a cheesy wink here?)\nWe were still hungry since we were two guys with empty stomachs.  Since we enjoyed the tacos so much, we tried the even better pork ribs tacos and the skirt steak sandwich.  Considering we'd already taken the edge off our appetites, these dishes were sooo good.  I'd definitely recommend sandwhiches and tacos if you're looking to fill up.

The spaces were fine, but seemed thrown together and not really thought out as a whole in decor and design.\n\nThe first tip offs to the food quality were the drinks; we each had one at the bar before continuing for dinner. My fiance's La Chilindrina was fine, but nothing special, while my Senor Barriga was pretty bad. With dinner, my fiance had an El Fumador, which was nigh undrinkable. We ordered it in part because the bartender described it as smokey, not spicy, and, yeah, it had habaneros in it, but who am I to second guess the bartender? Turns out, we should have (though the service was good while we were at the bar; this theme of good service and nothing else good continues throughout the place).\n\nDinner was just not good. We ordered the El Sabor tasting menu, so we got guacamole for the table along with an appetizer and entree each.  The guacamole was prepared tableside but overly salty and bland. We relied on the waitress's recommendations for appetizers figuring she wasn't incentivized to increase the check since we asked for the tasting menu. Well, her \"personal favorite appetizer\" huarache was bland bread with bean paste and raw egg, and the sweetbreads were a couple of breaded hunks with some pickled vegetables. There was no unification of taste, when there was much taste at all. Entrees were more of the same. My fiance's tamales were bland and bean-pastey--I've had better frozen from Trader Joe's. The best part was my brisket, which was tasty but salty, though the rest of the dish was really thrown together and, again, bland. I've had good celery root puree, but this was not it. It also took an extraordinarily long time for our entrees to arrive, even after the waitress assured us it \"would be right out\". We ended with the churros, which was good but not special, and we only ordered it because we didn't want our entrees to be the last taste in our mouths before we went home.\n\nOur waitress was quite nice, but this couldn't save the other lapses by the kitchen.

This year I came across Xochitl's Dias de los Muertos four course $35 prixe fixe menu, and we decided to go! \n\nSopas - My partner had the Pozole de Conejo (Rabbit) and I had the Caldo de Gallina y Masa (Chicken and Masa). They were good, but I did not have a single Masa dumpling in my soup... I was a little bummed. \n\nAntojitos - My partner had the Gorditas Infladas con Frijoles y Queso Panela and I had the Escabeche de Guajalote. I was pleased with my dish, but my partner was not pleased with his. \n\nPlatos Fuertes - My partner had the Carne con Cileajo with blue masa tortillas, I had the Pescado Zapoteco with pumpkin seed mole! AMAZING! We both loved these dishes! \n\nPostres - My partner had the Crepas de Plantano Macho, and I had the Clafouti de Calabaza. Mine was so / so and my partner only had a taste of his... They were not that great. \n\nWe were both uncomfortable, mostly because we were tucked away in a corner. The service was slow and our waiter did not seem like he was interested in being at work. We are definitely going to go back, but we are ordering from the main menu and we are making sure we have a different waiter / waitress."

I had the Braised Short Rip and my girlfriend had the Shrimp Chile Nogada.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  I think I may have liked her meal better than mine.  I also had like 3 Amarillos to drink, it was like a Lemon Mojito with pineapple. ..definitely making our own when we get home. \n\n100% chance I stop here again next time I'm in Philly."

        "text": "This was our 2nd visit to Xochitl.  The first was in 2015 for a fixed price tequila event (a different tequila was served with each course).  We were extremely happy with our meal, so we decided to go there for the first Restaurant Week of 2016. The server, Kate, was excellent.  She knew about all of the food and drinks on the menu, and she made recommendations to our table and other tables; she also checked with us frequently and made sure our water glasses were always filled.   [NOTE: Since it is Restaurant Week there is a special menu, so don't expect the full menu.]  We thought the food was only so-so this time.  The guacamole, as others have reported, is made to order (a card is placed on the table and you select how you want it made).  It is always the first course (whether or not it is Restaurant Week).  We would have preferred to have seen it made table-side, but it was good.\n\nThe next 3 courses were not very memorable.  My Caesar Asada was supposed to have grilled romaine, but it wasn't grilled, and the dressing was a little off.  My husband had Taquitos, which he said was fine but not anything to write home about.  For the main course I had the shrimp.  There were only 4 medium sized shrimp on the plate, and the menu said they would be adobo seared.  Instead the adobo was smeared on the plate.  I also think the shrimp was a bit under done.  There was a salad that was listed as an avocado salad, but it was more of a cilantro salad.  There was way too much cilantro, but there were 2 what they called fried sweet plantain cakes that were good.  My husband ordered the filet, and he noted that it was cooked really well, but the steak should not have been served over the rice because the red sauce complimented the steak but the crema did not.  He said he thought it was a clumsy presentation, but he would order it again, now that he knows how to put it together.\n\nOne other comment: we thought there should have been more spacing between the courses.  We were in and out in less than an hour, and the restaurant was not all that busy.  It wasn't like they needed our table.  \n\nWill we go back?  Yes.  We will give it another try."

We started off the night with a shot of tequila and a round of margaritas!  The margarita menu is faboosh and there wasn't one on there I didn't want to try.  (I did take a sip of one that was made with jalapeno...unless you genuinely like jalapeno I don't recommend this one).\nWe ordered the guacamole which was pretty delicious!  The margarita man (bartender) also hooked us up with an order of chiarrones from the appetizer menu since he asked us to make some room at the bar for some other patrons.  We were happy to do so but the food was an added bonus.  I'm from Miami and of cuban decent so I've had my share of chicharrones every Christmas eve and I have to say that Xotchil does a GREAT job!  They were not greasy and the sauce they were served with complimented them.\nThey have Hora de Fiesta specials, good service and a nice atmosphere for a night out w/ friends... I would definately recommend stopping by and sampling just about anything here if you are in Philadelphia!"

My wallet was upset with me.\n\nApril '12. My partner and I strolled here on a Friday night for a dinner date. Start out with a much more pleasant server--a fellow bearded gent. My partner inquired about the carmenere on the wine list, he provided a captivating description, so she ordered it and loved it--we actually ended up buying a case about a week later, so thanks dude! Also, $4 21st Amendment IPA is a huge plus.\n\nGuacamole: choose your own ingredients=sweet. The portion was easily double the size of my previous visit=ever better. Ahi tuna ceviche: flavors meshed well, all-around nice dish, yucca chips light and complimentary to the dish. Tacos (portion of 3) delectable combination of well thought-out ingredients and plenty of meat. The standout, however, was absolutely the SHORT RIB TAMALE: moist masa, incredibly tender and marinated short rib (A TON OF MEAT) and sweet pickled onion. This dish is a must. \n\nThe upscale Mexican decor works nicely (lots of browns and yellows, black wrought iron, white and blue tile), although I would like the lighting to be more muted/dimmer and have more candles.\n\nGreat experience the second time around. Get the tamale and a beer and your stomach will praise your divine judgment."

The area around this place is great. Good bars and nightlife. We walked in and it was smaller than we expected so thankfully it wasn't busy. We sat at the bar and they ordered tequila drinks and I stuck with Dos XX (because I always drink beer). They had a good deal going for 1 app, 1 taco meal for a good price. They have unique apps and meals which is good. Not your burrito type of place. I had the Cazuela De Chorizo y Papas as an app. Chorizo, potato's and leek. It was very good. The chorizo was ground beef like mixed in a hot bowl with the other ingredients. We also had the chips and their homemade Guac. Not the best guac I had but rather good. For a meal I had the arrachera which is skirt steak taco's (don't think Taco bell tacos). They are 3 soft, open faced blue tacos with steak, caramelized onions, tomato's and salsa. A lot of flavor although the steak could have used a little more seasoning. The bartender was helpful and friendly. The prices were good. Would go back if I return to the area."

I like the atmosphere and service was attentive enough.  The place is a bit overpriced for what you're getting.\n\nThe issue I have with the place is the somewhat questionable attitude that they exhibited when we went there.  But basically, we got there right around the end of happy hour.  We didn't expect to be able to order at happy hour prices/selection so we sat in the restaurant area instead of the bar area.  Then the waiter came over and asked us what we'd like to drink and we ask \"is happy hour still going?\" to which he replied \"yes but only in the bar, you can move over there if you'd like happy hour margaritas\".  That was reasonable enough so we told him we'd move over to a table in the bar area and we'd also take two happy hour margaritas.  He came by our new table a few minutes later and said that happy hour had actually ended so he couldn't bring us the margaritas for the same price anymore.  Meanwhile we're sitting at the table by the window and still looking at the happy hour sign on the sidewalk.  Anyway, we found this to be pretty ridiculous to tell a customer that they can get happy hour if they move but then change it once they do move.  Then the manager came by to explain that the waiter just didn't know that happy hour was over and that he couldn't give us the drinks for the lower price.  Frankly I didn't even care this much about getting a few dollars off of a margarita but being told one thing and then having them do another does bother me.  Finally, about 15 minutes later, the waiter came over to us and said that the manager would make an exception and give us one margarita each at the happy hour price.  Which is what they should have done from the get go.  What I can't believe about this whole ~30 minutes of silliness is that the waiter isn't just empowered to make that decision on the spot and avoid upsetting/annoying customers.  Any restaurant manager would be fine with his decision.  There was a grand total of like $8 on the line -- not exactly a big deal.\n\nAnyway, I like the food but the margarita stuff makes me think the place isn't that well managed."

We also ordered the Create your own Guacamole (you select the type of peppers,onions, tomatoes, garlic and cheese you want on a little card and give it to your server) and I must say it was the best Guacamole I've had in a long time. We also had the Huarache de Hongos which is a crispy masa flatbread, seared wild mushrooms, marinated artichokes topped with manchego and cotija cheese... it was INCREDIBLE! So we were two for two so far... onto the entrees. We ordered the Fish tacos and the Pork tacos to share although the server accidentally gave us the Beef tacos so we got to try one of them too. I wasn't super impressed but did eat 3 tacos nonetheless. I think they were fresh and cooked and prepared perfectly but I am just one of those people who love salsa and this is not the place that serves salsa with their tacos. \nI would give Xochitl 4 stars if it were not for the poor attitude of the server, bartender, and hostess.\nExample: We had a reservation and the hostess tried to sit us at a High Top table in the bar/waiting area. If I make a reservation I expect to sit \"down\" (not up) in the main dining area. It may just be me but I think it's just part of the guarantee you get when making a reservation ahead of time. Throughout our meal our server was rude, disinterested, and not attentive. The bartender also seemed to have a chip on his shoulder and I felt rushed throughout my Friday night dinner.\nI may come back if I feel that their service has improved based on other reviews."

Don't just order the same old margarita. . . Kick it up a few with the nublado or even try a flight!  We had a selection of 3 tequilas to taste test!

The sauce was fabulous and the meat fell apart is was so tender.\nI ordered the lamb belly which I was nervous about. It was the wrong selection for me.  I was extremely fatty and I got about 2 bites of actual lamb on my plate.  So I would suggest another selection.  \nThe atmosphere is quaint yet eclectic.  Our waitress was wonderful!

To make up for lost time, I called Xochitl to see if I can get a table for early Friday evening knowing that it's near impossible and after being told that they don't have any openings until after 10pm over really bad receptions, I found an opening on OpenTable at the time that I wanted. I wonder how these things work.\n\nIt was right after the snow storm and the streets are all piled up with snow banks and ice. My boyfriend and I arrived earlier than expected and got seated not long after at a table. I was surprised to see that despite the unusually bad condition outside, the restaurant is still quite packed. \n\nThe restaurant week menu is filled with items that usually appear on their regular prix fixe. We got an order of guacamole for the table. The server brought up a platter of ingredients, preparing the guacamole right in front of us (or in this case behind me.) Unfortunately, the aisle is kind of narrow and stepladder was riding on the coat I put on my chair. The ingredients include avocado, lime juice, cilantro, finely diced onion, jalapeno, habaneros and some kinds of cheese. The end product is to die for.\n\nFor appetizers, the boyfriend got a cazuela de chorizo y papas and I got an order of chicharrones. The chorizo and potatoes casserole taste like a spiced up well made corn beef hash which is pleasant and comforting. While I love chicharrones, the plate is a bit awkward; I had no idea what is the proper way to eat this dish. While its theoretically correct to pair fat with acid, the acidity in the salsa verde seems to be too imposing and one-dimensional. And if I'm forced to use my hand for the oversized chicharrones, how am I supposed to keep my hand dry getting the radishes inside the sauce?\n\nFor entrees, I had the scrumptious costilla de res. I have been having a lot of mole lately and I wasn't particularly excited for another mole dish but I did want something meat-and-potato-y and I was very glad to get this dish. The short-rib was tender and juicy, the mole was the best I've had yet, the potato puree was like silk, combining with the spinach makes it the perfect dish. The arroz con pollo was nice enough, using beer to make it adds a peculiar bitterness and instead of being crispy, the chicken is a bit crunchy which is interesting even though it's on a drier side.\n\nI go crazy for churros and the ones at Xochitl doesn't disappoint. Geniusly paired with a taza of Mexican hot chocolate for dipping, it adds an amazing array of flavors to an already delicious fried dessert. The pay de coco is cute but forgettable. I've had better but it's a nice choice. \n\nIt's a nice place and the service is friendly. The vintage South American movie posters serve as interesting conversation starters but a few trendy Mexican restaurants uses them as decoration and no matter who started using them, it's getting a bit tiring. I like the fact that they serve Jarritos for I love them. \n\nAt the end of the night, we spent $100 for a few small plates and I caught an error on the bill where they charged us beers that we didn't consume and they were polite and nice about taking it off, but one still has to wonder if the meal we had was worth the money we paid."

El Vez boasts an incredible Guac experience - the \"make your own\" is Xo superior at Xochitl. Ours had black truffle, plum tomatoes, roasted garlic, amazing cheese, and maybe some other things - there was so much to choose from and all of it was so good.

Restrain yourself from finishing it all otherwise it'll spoil your appetite like it did for me.\n\nThere's a $28 special - you get a bunch of delicious ingredients (meats, veggies, cheeses) and tortillas and then you get to make your own tacos. Pretty sweet deal... but we didn't do that. Instead, we opted for the normal taco plates (we'll try the standard dinner options next time, and there's definitely a next time). \n\nI had brisket. She had fish. Yowzers. All so, so good. The fish taco has cabbage that's got tremendous flavor and crunch (vinegar). The taco itself has a tiny kick of heat; always appreciated. Brisket taco was just damn good. Best tacos I've had in the city so far. Only needed one after all the guac but ate one brisket and one fish and was stuffed.\n\nServer also recommended some sides: Esquites (Mexican Sweet Corn) and Rice & Manchego (what our server referred to as Mexican Mac 'N Cheese). If I have to bother explaining how awesome these were after just reading sweet corn and mac 'n cheese, then either this place isn't for you or you dislike corn and/or mac n' cheese. If that's the case, then I ask - do you like food? Really? =)\n\nDidn't want to order dessert but saw chocolate tres leches and had to have it. Wasn't as good as the tres leches that Valanni used to serve but it was delicious nonetheless, and not overly sweet. Great texture, would have loved to see that tempting puddle of milk at the bottom of the cake, but it was good in its own right. I'm hungry just thinking about Xochitl - it was Xo Xo good. \n\nI'll be coming back!"

The Margaritas were just voted the best in town by Philadelphia Magazine - not a bad reason to stop by in and of itself. There is a two hour happy hour 5-7 and also a late night menu. The guacamole is made fresh right at your table - so you can add more of what you like and less of what you don't. It was absolutely fabulous. My girlfriend and I split a mixed grill platter with skirt steak (cooked perfectly), chicken, shrimp, blood sausage, and Chihuahua cheese (both hard and melted - which is still firm). There were also peppers, onions, and two sauces on the platter (hot and very hot). It was also served with warm tortillas. This was one of the few platters on the menu designed for two people to share. The service was fantastic. At a Mexican restaurant its important never to have an empty glass of water as you never know when the next kick in the throat might come. We were taken care of very well by a very knowledgable staff. We didn't have any dessert, but they looked amazing. A trio of flans, a carmelized bananas dessert, an apple empanada with cinnamon ice cream, and then finally chocolate churros. All in all a fantastic evening at a great new restaurant right off South Street in Headhouse Square. Definitely check this place out!"

Similar upscale Mexican restaurants like Tequilas in the city are much better. We got their signature guacamole that has pineapple in it - zero flavor and we even told that to our waitress after we requested salt/pepper to try and add some taste to it. She said she'd inform the kitchen, but most restaurants would then offer something else or take it off your bill. My boyfriend got the Campechana ceviche and that was great and a good size portion. However, my shrimp enchiladas were disappointing. Shrimp was cooked perfectly and loved the side salad, but the chef drenched the sauce with salt and I couldn't finish the meal.\n\nGiving this review three stars versus fewer since the the margaritas were delicious. I got the strawberry basil and my boyfriend got their ultimate margarita, which had top-shelf liquor."

Its interesting walking in since it splits off into 3 areas.  The first side is the bar area with some table, and on the other side was another area with mostly tables.  Downstairs  is the lounge which i think is very popular, since while we were there we noticed lots of people coming in and just heading straight downstairs.\n\nThe menu was pretty decent.  Lots of familiar things, and overall a good mix of ceviches, small plates and a few larger plates of meats and seafood and drinks and such.  However that saying, you won't find names like fajita, burrito, enchilada, etc. \n\nWe started out with margaritas, which were actually really good.  But anything is pretty good with tequila right?  Then we had the \"Vuelve\" ceviche, shrimp octopus, scallops and oysters, which again was a nice starter.  Very refreshing and well portioned for two.  Next was some baby goat (don't knock it till you try it, goat in general I mean) and the parrillada, which was a mix of chicken, steak, shrimp and duck.  Interesting....my goat was pretty good, cooked well, could have done with some more heat and seasoning.  The parrillada was good as well.  \n\nService was great, our waitress was very attentive and made some good suggestions for us.\n\nI was expecting something more, but it didn't really live up to all the hype for me.  Not saying I won't go back or it wasn't good, but that besides great presentation of food, nice drinks and a cool lounge, there is better mexican food to be had in town."

The table side guacamole, excellent margaritas, some of the best ceviche in Philadelphia and a stand out goat stew. \n\nBoy have things changed over the last year. The menu is now toned down to a couple of small plates, tacos, tortas and about 4 large plates. The margaritas are still excellent but unfortunately loaded with ice and good for about four large sips. \n\nWe had a disappointing start to our meal. The extremely fresh table side guacamole was our reason for returning. Sadly we were presented with a large dish of chips with a scoop of guacamole that was heavy on lime. Ok with drinks, but no comparison to the predecessor. Tuna Ceviche followed with a grey oddly textured mound of tuna. I really did not like this dish (something was amuck) Of the three appetizers we ordered, the lamb tamale was easily the best. Rich lamb enveloped in a very nice casing of masa.\n\nFor entrees, I had the pork cheek tacos that were braised in beer and served with a walnut mole. While the pork was braised perfectly, the mole was low on flavor (which is kinda sad as far as moles go) My girlfriend had the stuffed chicken breast, that you really could not identify what the stuffing was. The innards were spongy, with a hint of salt. This is the type of entree that I would expect to be served at a poorly/cheaply catered wedding. \n\nWhile you will most definitely be disappointed if you had eaten here when it was more upscale, I have to say that this is mediocre Mexican food at best.\n\nService was attentive and excellent."

Regardless, my friends and I had a couple of specialty drinks from their menu which were delicious. If you like bloody marys, try their micheleda for a little kick.\n\nAnyways, once our entire party arrived, we were promptly sat.  After persuing the menu we decided to go with the El Sabor prix-fixed-like option which allowed you to choose your own individual entree and appetizer from the menu and it also got you fresh table-prepared guacamole, which ended up being delicious, but we all agreed paled in comparison to El Vez' many versions.\n\nWe all ended up choosing a different appetizer and entree so we could taaste the full spectrum of what they had to offer. I got the flank steak which was cooked properly and had a delicious ancho steak sauce poured over it.  The rest of the table got the fried chicken, the salmon, and the tamales, with everyone esaying that their meals were good.\n\nI mean, all in all, the meal was good, it just didnt do anything to separate itself from any other quality mexican restaurant I have been to.  With the reputation that this place has, they should have raised the bar a little higher."

The broth was superior and they way it was served is again a testament to their creative presentation. \n\nWife had the \"Costillas de Res - Braised short ribs with sweet potato-chipotle mash\" - it was just perfect. \n\nI had the \"Chile en Nogada- Poblano pepper stuffed with ground turkey, dried fruit and nuts, with a creamy walnut sauce and pomegranate\". It tasted great, but there was one problem, the ground turkey was almost nonexistent...couldn't have been more than a tablespoon of turkey...pretty lame!\n\nOne last thing the young male host at the door was very snooty when we arrived at 7pm and asked for a table for 2.

My wife and I ordered the huarache de hongos (flatbread with mushrooms, artichokes with manchego and cotija cheese) and ahi tuna ceviche as appetizers. The hongos tasted like you were eating pure melted cheese. I couldn't taste the mushrooms or artichoke. The ahi tuna ceviche was terrible. I couldn't tell if I was eating regular salsa from a food store or ahi tuna ceviche. We had the camarones con caldo for our entree. The shrimp were not seasoned or marinated. The tomato chili broth they were served with was too spicy and lacked zest. Best part of the entire meal was the plantains that came with the entree. As for the drinks, the menu looks awesome. The number of tequila options is vast. I really liked the Kah tequila flight but the mixed drinks were disappointing. The blood orange margarita was too sweet. The pineapple margarita tasted like someone squeezed an entire lemon into your mouth. Not worth coming back here."

The octopus had a nice texture-- and I do not like octopus, but this go around it was surprisely not chewy. \n\nFor dinner, the boy had the pork shank, which annoyed me because who goes to a pricey spot to get pork?? But I was silenced - it was awesome, crazy fall-off-the-bone tender when you sank your fork into it. \n\nI had the barbacoa, and though I've never really been much of a goat meat fan, it was incredible. Beware the tiny thai peppers sitting on the plate--unless your mouth is iron-coated, it'll burn a hole. The cactus salad on the side was also tasty! \n\nFor dessert, we had the churros with chocolate and caramel-esque dipping sauces. We literally ate all the sauce out of the little dipping bowls.

But after Cook and Solo sold the restaurant last summer, things have gone downhill.\n\nThough the staff is said to still be the same, the quality just doesn't seem so. It's just not quite right -- the service is decent, though don't expect them to tell you prices for specials if they are not listed. The food has changed with the new chef and it just isn't working. \n\nSome of the best menu items are no longer there, including the tortilla soup, and it appears the bar menu is no longer available. In general, prices have increased but the value has not. A recent dinner with three girlfriends, with an order of guac, three entrees and one drink each, cost us more than $150 and we each left hungry. The highly touted fried chicken was lackluster and the camarones con caldo, while cooked well, wasn't balanced in its seasoning. Too much adobo.\n\nSome great items still remain, like the Xochitl salad, guacamole with added crab meat, steak tacos and all the desserts (especially the flan). \n\nBut for me, Xochitl is destined to be a spot for drinks and small snacks only."

While we debate the \"savings\" of the prix fixe offerings it got us out to dinner here sooner than later (normal menu pricing would not have deterred a visit.)  What a surprise. Great relaxed vibe, attentive, friendly service and contemporary Latin decor.\n\nThe bar and dining area on the main floor is cozy, could seem tight if the place was packed but not claustrophobic. Except the water closet - and I say W.C. 'cuz that is the size of it. not quite airplane size but smaller than the handicap ones on a 747 (there are additional ones downstairs that I didn't visit.)\n\nNow the food, it was delish. Nothing disappointed from the contemporary Mexican offerings. We started with the table-side prepared quac which was very fresh and tasty. Next were the ceviche de fluke (light and refreshing) and cazuela de chorizo y papas (bold, spicy and a nice compliment to the kale - only way I'll eat kale in the future :-) Third course we dined on the falda de res (flank steak cooked to medium with a great sear around) and carnitas de puerco (tender, melt in your mouth pork cheeks.) All topped off with cajeta cheese cake (from goats milk - you'd have to like goat's milk cheese or it may be too assertive in flavor but rich and creamy just the same) and churros (accompanying Mexican hot chocolate which was rich in flavor but not as thick as the pudding-like variety of Spain.)\n\nOverall a great experience and am looking forward to returning and trying a tequila flight and some other menu items. Contrary to some other recent reviews we had no service issues. And, without seeing the downstairs dining space, I wouldn't suggest a party larger than 8 - beside you never have that much fun with that many people at once anyway :-)"

On several occasions, they walked away with our drinks when there was half still left, then asked if we want another one.  Its clear that they find every way possible to increase the size of your bill.  Another time, I asked if they would mix  soda water with juice in a glass and when the bill came, I was charged for a glass of each.\n\nRecently, their new talent has been bringing one entree (mine), then once its finished, taking the plate and silverware, then bringing my husband's a solid half hour later.

The hostess offered us the opportunity to sit at one of the tables in the bar downstairs which apparently opens at 6:30, and even came to ask us if we wanted a table downstairs instead. A lot of people were eating at the upstairs bar, and the feel was very pleasant, so we just stayed there. Both bartenders were very nice, and the service was fast and courteous.   \n\nThe cocktails are a bit expensive, but delicious and strong! One is definitely enough. I also tried the tamarind aqua fresca, which I don't really know how to describe. Apparently it is a seasonal recipe. I have never had anything like that before, but it was certainly good, and helped me sober up. \n\nWe ordered a guacamole to start, which was great. I had the squid hot pot, and my boyfriend had the pork loin entree. Mine come in a terracotta pot dressed with a lime and red sauce. At $17, it was good and very filling, almost too much food. The pork loin was served with potatoes and little blue corn tortillas in a nice medley of flavors. He complained a little that that his was expensive, and compared to most burrito joint Mexican fare it is, but the portion size and quality are excellent. He said based on the price, he would rate it 4 1/2 stars since he was the one who paid! The food at this place reminds me of the way Lolita was a few years back, but better, especially since it has a full bar. \n\nEnchanting location right on Headhouse square, where all the little colored lights sparkle on the trees at night. The interior is quaint without being overdone; candles, wrought iron and Mexican tile work, but in keeping with the colonial feel of the building and surrounding area.

It was way better than ones I've had before, and that's saying a lot.\n\nThe atmosphere could have been a little darker for being a pretty small dining area, but no glaring complaints here."

I'm also one of those people that rarely give 5 stars (without some mention of how it should really be 4.5).  However, Xochitl has commanded both a revisit (and a re-revisit, with more in the future), and 5 genuine stars from me.  \n\nI've been here several times now, and each time I've been really pleased.  I've liked everything I've ever tried.  I won't go into specifics because the other reviewers have covered that pretty well.  Also, at this point, between my friends and I, we've probably tried the whole menu.  So this review applies to the whole menu.  The guacamole, ceviche and main entrees are all, as Guy Fieri (hate him) would say, \"Money\".  \n\nAnd if you needed any more reason to give this place respect, the Chef, Dionicio Jimenez started off as a dishwasher and worked his way up from Vetri's kitchen to open this place.

We really particularly enjoyed the personable attention given by Kate, one of the bartenders. In fact the only negative part of our dinner was when we asked to be seated at a different table and the bald manager gave us a little unnecessary attitude. Also after we finished and payed the check we stayed at our table for a few minutes to allow the food to digest a bit before we headed in our way out and he kept watching us making us feel a little rushed to leave despite the restaurant not being very busy. \n\nAgain no issues with the food, the service, or the staff.

A Groupon and a special occasion finally led me to dinner there recently.\n\nI don't like to give 5 star reviews after just one visit, however I honestly can't think of a reason not to. The food was fabulous as was the service, drinks and atmosphere. There's no reason they don't deserve this 5.\n\nMy husband and I arrived a little before our reservation to check out happy hour. We sat at the bar and were able to enjoy a few of their delicious margaritas. They don't use mixes and you can taste the fresh squeezed lime. They were strong, but you couldn't tell. \n\nSo we got the Groupon deal that others have mentioned. It includes a shared guacamole, shared flatbread, choice of two entrees and shared dessert. They were so very kind as to let us do a little menu modification. Rather than the shared flatbread, we opted for our own guacamoles, which excited me since I could try it with ingredients my husband doesn't like.\n\nWait, ingredients in guacamole? Yep, you get to customize it. I opted for Spanish onion, raw garlic, cilantro, jalapeno, crab and goat cheese. It was heavenly! It was so creamy, and it had the perfect balance between tasting the individual ingredients and being well blended. The chips were light and crispy with a nice amount of saltiness. \n\nFor our entrees, my husband and I decided to share the braised short rib and Pollo Fritto. I'm honestly not fan of ordering chicken out, but the Yelp reviews swayed us in the direction of the Pollo Fritto. Do yourself a flavor and get it. It was lightly fried chicken was very packed with flavor. The skin and meat were delectable. The short rib was also top notch and I would have been raving more about it, if the Pollo Fritto wasn't so darn good. Amazing, amazing, amazing. The sides were delicious as well. \n\nThe meal came with a chocolate sponge cake soaked in triple chocolate cream with whipped cream and coco power. It was plated with a big \"X\" for Xochtil on it. Not only was the dessert good, but I enjoyed the presentation. A chocolate sponge cake could have looked so boring. \n\nThe Groupon also comes with a wine pairing for each course except dessert. With the exception of the main course, you didn't get an option. For the main course you could choose between a Malbec or a Chardonnay. The wines were enjoyable and on point with each course. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, we also had top notch service. Our server was attentive, friendly, funny but not the least bit intrusive. \n\nPro tip: you are allowed to buy this Groupon every 90 days.\n\nGroupon or not, we will be back. Despite taking so long to actually try it in the first place, Xochtil has quickly found a place on my favorites list."

In fairness it is a bit of a stretch for most beer drinkers, but hey not all Mexican beers are the best and need to be sex'd up a bit. Don't do this with a dark beer and while you can use any lager, I suggest Tecate as I feel this to be the least flavorful of Mexican beers. It is spicy, so all of you out here in PA that refuse to try anything hotter than ketchup should stay away. My date's sangria was done beautifully as well.\n\nSo this really is the best Mexican food I've found here in Philly. It is not your Taco Bell/North Border (or what ever the hell that weak ass shit is called) but rather an authentic interior Mexican restaurant. It is a cuisine and this place does a wonderful job of showcasing it's subtleties. \n\nOh, if anyone knows of a good Taqueria let me know please :)"

Heres the long and the short...\n\nThe mushroom/artichoke flatbread was visually appealing but somewhat bland. Short rib tamale wasnt exactly a tamale as it was a pile of short rib on top of a few masa medallions. To their credit, the short rib itself was tasty, but the dish was so over-engineered I wish it just came wrapped in a damn corn husk. \nOur favorite was the carnitas tacos. Easily among the most flavorful and well executed carnitas I've had in a long time. Tender shredded pork finish fried to a crisp, served on proper corn tortillas with diced onions and cilantro. Thats the one thing I would come back for (at the moment).  I only wish they werent so damn small, especially for $12. \n\nOverall, it would seem all the right elements are in place for a successful contemporary mexican restaurant - picturesque location, competant bar with heavy pours, and some decent flavor coming out of the kitchen. So why the 2 stars? My biggest gripes are with the tapas sized dishes with entree sized prices, and the hit-or-miss service. In our circumstance, our wait staff seemed to alternate between the manager on duty and a roving waiter, neither of which was sure who was responsible for our table. Also, we ordered 2 mojitos when we sat down... they were the last and only drinks to hit our table for the duration of our meal, despite being finished before the food ever got there. It was OK though, we got drinks somewhere else after we left. \n\nI really want this place to be successful, they just need to work out their growing pains. Maybe I'd go back for happy hour, but not anytime soon."

We did three courses (and I am too lazy to go to the website and find the actual names of what we ordered so bear with me).\nGuacamole- fresh and delicious.  Presentation was kind of crappy.\nCrispy pork skins- very good.  Served warm and they crackled in your mouth.  Eating one with the accompanying radish and salsa all in one bite was great, all sorts of tastes at once.\nOctopus on skewers with mole- ok, not my favorite of the night.\nChorizo with potatoes and kale- so hearty and filling.\nCuban-  made with pork belly.  'Nuff said.\nThree little soft tacos with cheek, and then three with brisket and a bacalao cream.  Cheek was good, not a bacalao fan at all but my husband really enjoyed.\n\nSo, why 3.5 stars?

It came out deliciously fresh, and it had a nice kick to it because we added jalepenos. \n\nThey had a huge selection of tequila as well. My boyfriend is more knowledgeable about tequila than I am, so he got a flight, and I got the rose margarita. I think I will go for the flight next time - we had the Manager's special and I enjoyed all three. \n\nThis place is pretty pricey, so to save money, we got the Molcajete dinner for two which is a special they run Sunday through Thursday - it's basically a make your own fajitas type deal. They give you carnitas, chorizo, chicken, short rib, onions, cheese, and cactus leaf, all in a salsa (red or green - we got green) and sizzling in a hot stone bowl made from molten lava. \n\nAlthough this meal was good, it wasn't outstanding, and that's why I'm giving it three stars instead of four. The tortillas had no flavor, and there weren't enough toppings for the fajitas, so they wound up being basically all meat. I would've liked more onion, rice would have been ideal, and they should give peppers instead of  the cactus leaf (it had no flavor at all). \nThe salsa was tasty though, and the meat was pretty good (chicken was the best in my opinion). \n\nI would go back for the guac, but I like the same molcajete meal at Tequilas better."

Because obviously, I know what REAL Mexican food is. . Xochitl is NOT I repeat NOT authentic Mexican food. I came in here knowing that full well but I of course was trying to keep an open mind. \n\nThe fact that they need to put \"So-Cheet\" on the sign was my first annoyance. I get it, it's not a common name, and in Society Hill lets be real, not many people can pronounce it without that help. My second annoyance was our waiter, a tall thin Buddy Holy hipster. While I looked over the menu I asked if the margarita's were offered only on the rocks or blended as well? \"No we put them in a shaker and blend them before they are served\" Uhhhhh... I think to myself, is this guy f*cking with me?! I guess I have to say \"frozen\"?  When our drinks arrive I notice my friends \"Sangria\" has ice in it and one tiiiiiny piece of apple? What in the fame of Jesus Christo is going on here?!?!!?\n\nI look over the menu and think OK so it's \"White people Mexican fusion\" I got itttttt. At least they have the good sense not to put cheddar or American cheese on anything. But come on!!! You are trying way too hard, Xochitl. I ordered the fish tacos and discover that even at $16 friggin dollars they do not come with any sides. Are you kidding me?!?! Dear Lord Baby Jesus!!!!  I can feed an entire family real Mexican food on Mission St. for that. They tasted awful. The fish was soaked in some kind of oil and tasted fishy rather than spiced. I had two bites of one, pushed it aside and instead ate off of everyone Else's plates. \n\nThe carnitas tacos were edible but not note worthy. The star dishes of the night were the build your own guac (still some options like tuna?! which I refused to let my friends add were laughable) and the aroz con manchgo. The \"Mexican STREET corn\" ok Esquites was so so. Thank god for my house \"blended in a shaker\" Margarita or I might have just started a riot in the middle of the downstairs seating area. Yes, did I mention we were seated next to the bathrooms downstairs? I had to be stopped from asking our Hispanic runner if she was sour that she has to serve this crap all day. \n\nSigh. The hostess was friendly, the runner was sweet and our water glasses were filled regularly but our waiter was a joke. He never once asked us how the food was and my friend said that on more than one occasion as he checked on the table of uppity young d-bags next to us, he'd look over and simply walk away. What about the bond between hipsters, com-padre? \n\nI will pay top dollar for good food. I will pay a fortune for good authentic Mexican food at this point. Xochitl is neither. 2 stars for the nice hostess, table runner, good guac, and rice. But for now I'll stick to Chipotle."

Also may the hands of whoever is controlling the music and its volume fall off. Way too loud. If your servers have to yell at the guests just to ask if they want a drink then the music is too loud. Which in turn causes patrons to yell to have conversation which only adds to the awful din. \n\nNow as a preface we went here during restaurant week. But the place was not packed so I see little excuses for the kitchen to be so abhorrently slow. Service was average with the exception of the busing staff. They were prompt, friendly, and efficient. I hope the servers tip out to them. \n\nNow lets get to the awfulness that is the food. If you are vegetarian or even occasionally enjoy a veggie dish or two like me, do not come here. I was enticed in by descriptions of dishes like Azteca civeche \"Pickled late-summer vegetables served on warm sopes with salsa verde\". Sounds tasty right? Wrong, it was a sloppy mess of veggies which ranged from pure vinegar to raw. The taste was nothing but sour and overly spicy. None of the veggies retained their own flavors. Moving on to the next course was only slightly better. The pumpkin & black bean empanadas were good but the black bean and the salsa negra overpowered the pumpkin. The final savory dish was terrible. The calabacitas description as follows sounds good \"Summer squash with their blossoms, vegetarian mole verde, swiss chard, pickled fennel\" but what I received was once again a sloppy mess of homogeneous textures, colors, and flavors that made me gag. This was served on a flavorless blue corn tortilla. This kind of food makes me weep for vegetarians who this chef ,obviously neither understand nor likes. Why would you serve something like this? I would be ashamed to let this out of my kitchen. Vegetarians do like flavor. At least a little salt or something. \n\nThe desserts were all average and felt like I could duplicated by getting a mix from my famous aunt Betty. The flan being the only exception, it was actually very nice. \n\nIn summary, we left discussing whether or not to stop by McD's to get some descent food on the way home. I got home and ate some tums."

The restaurant is a tiny place, it looked like one waitress serving all the tables.  The guacamole is great, as everyone has said.  You get a nice big serving of it.  And the food we ordered was very tasty.\n\nNow the annoying... The prices were steep.  I generally will not go above $20 on mexican food, and almost every entree was north of $20.  So we both ordered from the tacos menu.  We got 3 tacos, no rice, no beans, no nothing.  Three tacos for $16?  Steep.  Ordered a side of rice.  If it was a 3 taco PLATTER (rice, beans, etc) for $16 i could have let it go.\n\nThey have a Molcajete (tacos for 2) meal which I want to try if I come back.  But ordering off the regular menu is not likely."

The best thing about Xochitl is that the portion sizes are designed for normal people and not IHOP customers. Leaves you full but not way too full. The downstairs seating is a little dim but a better sound level than upstairs. Really good guac and great margaritas, and a good selection of Mexican beers. Desserts are small but delectable, and the staff is friendly and attentive. \n\nI really want to love this restaurant, but it's a little too expensive for me to visit more often.

I've been to the two other Cook + Solo restaurants (Zahav and Percy Street BBQ) and I suppose I was expecting a bit more, especially for the price.\n\nWe started with the guacamole, which is made table-side, and it was delicious.  For an entree, I had the brisket.  This was where my faith dwindled.  The meat was fork tender, but a little dry at the same time and a bit bland.  The whipped bacalao on top basically tasted like canned tuna salad and I gave up on it after three bites.  But the scallions and fennel ceviche around the plate did round out the flavors nicely.  My partner got the ribs and enjoyed them.\n\nFor dessert, we got the churros and so should everyone.  ever.  They are perfectly crispy on the outside, while moist and fluffy inside.  Add the dipping chocolate and take a ten minute vacation from your life.\n\nSo, the pattern of good+meh+good = three stars.  Wait staff was friendly and informative.  Drinks were good and the atmosphere was comfortable.\n\nI would go back to Xochitl, possibly to give it another entree try, or just for apps and drinks."

Although the name is the same, it's definitely not the same restaurant.\n\nThe food was very good but it doesn't match the incredible cuisine that the prior chef created.  Sadly their drinks have also changed: gone many of the unique concoctions that I loved (such as the El Fumador).  Both the food and drink menus are decidedly uninspired.  The margaritas are good but (i though) a bit over-sweetened.  I have no complaints about the blood orange martini, however.  As for the food, it was just okay - the guac is more modestly portioned than it used to be and the appetizers (at least the ones we got) were bland. The Pollo Frito, supposedly this restaurant's signature dish, was tasty but lacked that out-of-this-world taste that you'd expect for a nearly 30-dollar entree.\n\nOur service was also lacking and I'm willing to chalk it up to an \"off night\", but when you're just not served two dishes that you've ordered it warrants mentioning.  Other tables' food was also brought to ours.  We received a dessert dish in lieu of the missing appetizer, but nothing was removed from the bill (nor offered to be).  The manager promised to make it up to us \"next time\".  Sadly, I'm not sure there will be one."

I had Ceviche de Callos con Sandia which is a scallop and watermelon ceviche and it was amazing. Super thin sliced and tasty. She had a beet salad which I'm told was awesome (I didn't try it). For dinner, I had Barbacoa de Borrego Borracho which was this slow cooked lamb dish with little tortillas to wrap it in. We had some guacamole left over so I used it up with my mini wraps.. awesome. She had Cazuela de Calamar al Ajillo which was a squid dish that was pretty good as well. We had some drinks at the bar that were pretty good also, but the standout was the Do\u00f1a Florinda.

They are not on OpenTable as of this review, but you can still make them on their own site. \n\nI attended Xochitl twice in one weekend. I wasn't planned this way, however I enjoyed my Friday night visit so much i begged the excellent hostess, Kelly, to squeeze in my parents and I on Saturday night. - which she did.\n\nFor a great appetizer I cannot recommend enough the Guacamole Con Totopos. A gentleman comes to your table and makes Guacamole to order - just fantastic. A very unique and tasty dish is the Ceviche De Callos Con Sandia which is thinly sliced scallops and watermelon. I sampled 4 different main entries and honestly you could just pick any one on the menu and you would be pleased.\n\nAnother great feature of Xochitl is their drink selection. A great selection of tequilas including homemade spicy pepper infused tequila makes for some amazing drinks. They also have a selection called \"Frozen Beer\" (which I had to try of course) which is a beer combined with tomato juice and a sweet and spicy rim (yeah yeah I know how it sounds, but trust me its great."

The fish was very fresh, flavors perfectly balanced. The plantain chips were also yummy and added great texture. \n\nI had the house specialty, the pollo frito. Not the fried chicken you would normally expect. The skin isn't particularly crispy, but the 24-hour brining process really makes a HUGE difference - the meat was so flavorful and moist without being greasy like most fried chicken. I usually never order chicken at restaurants, but I would get this again! The cornbread on the side was great too - very moist and a little sweet. \n\nMy fiance had the special - mussels in a chili and chorizo broth. Very tasty and executed perfectly.

And it was worth it.\n\nThe basics. The price was reasonable. Not cheap, but worth it. I'd say the food is priced accurately. Service was friendly and quietly attentive. The atmosphere is great. Not fancy, but definitely nice. The beverages are also good - I like that they don't offer your standard sodas - only Mexican Coke and a few fruity sodas, as well. I had a pineapple-infused tequila cocktail and my boyfriend had a Dos Equis (draft). The cocktail was perfectly made. I reccomend. \n\nWe started off with a guacomole special - pomegrante seeds and bleu cheese. SO DELICIOUS! It was made tableside and it is everything you'd imagine it would be. The cheese added a mild flavor and the pomegrante seeds added a whole other level I didn't even know about yet. Very good. We followed that up with the Sopa Azteca (tortilla soup) and one of the ceviches. Both of these were excellent. The ceviche trio was light and tasty. The soup (which is vegetarian, fyi) was warm and tasty. When we switched plates, the spoon fell into the bowl and got a littly messy - this was, literally, the only thing wrong with the entire meal and it was entirely our fault. My fingers got a little wet because I didn't feel like asking for another spoon, but that's just the way it goes. The tortilla strips in the soup were stil crisp, the broth was flavorful, but not overpowering, and the cubes of cheese got meltier and meltier as we ate, which was a delight. I love cheese.\n\nFor my main course, I had their vegetarian dish, a cheese empanada trio (which is new to the menu, replacing the leek \"scallops\" - the sever had to inform us of the new items, as the new menus they ordered are on their way). It was served with long julienned roasted veggies, rice, and adobo sauce. The empanadas were small but incredibly rich and delicious. I forget the exact combinations, but one was full of bleu cheese and apples, another manchego (and maybe something else), and the other with another type of cheese and dates. I may be mixing these up, but either way, they had a very distinct flavor and were extremely filling. My boyfriend had the grilled strip steak, medium, and was blown away. It came with veggies, some sort of green salad with crema. The blue corn tortillas that come with the dish are a nice bonus, even though he only used one since the steak was perfect by itself.\n\nAfter our entrees we were full. Not kind of full, or almost there. Stuffed. But we opted for dessert, still. We ordered the carmelized bananas with some sort of rum sauce and walnut ice cream (again, I am basing all of this off of memory, this could be slightly inaccurate). It was flipping delicious. The bananas were sugary and crunchy, but not too sweet.\n\nWe left satisfied. Almost too satisfied. I could have puked I was so full. But the meal was delicious from start to finish and the restaurant itself is great. Five stars, I'd give it five and a half if I could."

For the 3rd course we each got to select an entree.  We asked the waitress for her recommendations, then we both accepted them.  I had the chicken taco, and my husband had the brisket taco.  I did not like the corn tortillas and ended up eating the chicken without them.  My husband said his brisket taco was only so-so. To be fair, he is from Texas, so he knows his tacos, and he said he's had a lot better.\n\nFor dessert there was a shared chocolate sponge cake.  The plate was beautiful, but there was more whipped cream than cake.

I ordered the mushroom tamal and it was probably my fault since I didn't know what it was when I ordered, but it was basically extremely soggy corn bread with a few mushrooms on top, i couldn't eat it.

I was a bit overwhelmed at their list of tequilas to choose from and then there were 3 types...I guess I'm an amateur tequila drinker, I didn't really know the difference so I just got what the waitress recommended - one of the blanco tequilas...excellent choice :-)  It was really tasty and sweet...so good, I had to have another one in their basement.  Someone else probably already mentioned but they do have $5 margaritas for happy hour, and on Friday nights, their HH's are from 10pm-midnight.\n\nSo the other neat thing about this restaurant is they make guacamole at your table and you can pick and choose what spices and stuff you want in it.  Fortunately my friends and I are super easy going so we just said sure to everything the guacamole maker offered to put in and it was sooo good.  Besides that I ordered the Salmon, which comes with vegetables and rice - also very good stuff.  Definitely recommended."

Drinks and Margaritas were nice and would have been nicer with a little less ice. Food was great.  We aced then ingredient selection for the custom made Guacamole and our group of three ordered a second helping.   Queso Fundido con corrizzo appetizer was also very good.  The Flat Lorn Tampiquena that I had was well sized, well prepared and delicious. Friends had Red Snapper and Pollo Frito and both were happy with their entrees  as well.  As a cramped venue the noise level can grow. This was made worse by our being seated, even with reservations, in the basement with a very large party celebrating a birthday and just two other tables, ours and a couple dining.  Suggested to management if you book such a large group for a celebratory event you give them that whole space.  Server did her best to serve everyone and be attentive despite the large party standing and blocking her access. Did comment to the management and hope for better seating in order to enjoy an otherwise good meal on my next visit."

I remember walking out of there last night telling my husband that if I didn't order the Mexican street corn as a side with my entree and the pitcher of (red) sangrias that we shared, I would have been really upset. \n\n-Appetizers: We started with the queso fondito with peppers which was okay. It was very greasy, but was good enough to settle a craving that my husband had. \n\n-For the entrees, I ordered the carnitas tacos which automatically came with a side of beans. The was really disappointed because the pork meat itself - although tender had no flavor. The worst part was the side of beans... they were semi warm and still had the aluminum can taste... there was absolutely nothing added to them!! My husband ordered the short rib tamale which he really enjoyed, but the portion was a tapa-like portion at a fabulous price of $14. \n\n-For dessert, my husband got the churros with hot chocolate (which was luke warm), and I ordered the chocolate tres leches. The desserts were not great but not horrible. \n\n-Service: At first, the service was fantastic... we had our appetizer and first round of margaritas delivered to our table within 20 minutes of being seated. However, once we received our dinners and sangria, it's like the waiter forgot we existed for the remaining 45 minutes that we were there. \n\n-Overall: If we didn't have a groupon, we would have been really upset but with the discount, the bill wasn't too bad for a mediocre meal in Philly. \n\n-Tip: If you want authentic Mexican food, take a drive up to Conshy for El Limon."

Not a huge deal, since I was intent on ordering Dona Florindas.\n\nWell, they changed the way they make them and now they use apricot infused tequila instead of pineapple infused tquila - but hot bartender made me one old school.  TERRIFIC.\n\nThe 3 of us each ordered the Sunday Special - 3 courses plus Guac for the table for $35.00.  It was a ton of food - and a good value.\n\nThe table-side guac was top of the line, as usual.  So delicious.  Once we ate it and had our apps (I had a fresh and sublime shrimp cocktail with jicama and mango) we were too full for the entrees.  I enjoyed my skirt steak with unique \"Avocado fries\".  My friend special ordered a mixed grill and did not like it.  I felt bad for her.\n\nMeanwhile, DH had the pork and enjoyed it.  I never eat pork, but it looked well prepared.\n\nSince I was so full - I ate about 3 bites (yummy, tender, succulent bites) of the steak and had it boxed to go.  We still had dessert coming and I was jonsin' for churros.  Well, they came out burnt.  Such a shame - as we had eaten them twice before.  DH had the chocolate cake which was rich and delectable and came with a Cajeta ice cream.\n\nAll 3 of us had the Mexican Hot chocolate - and I like Xochitl's version even  better than the Aztec one at the Naked Chocolate Cafe.  (Nakeds is too spicey for me.)\n\nSo it wasn't quite the 5 star experience that we had on the 2 prior visits - but it was still very, very good.  It just kinda feels like (maybe its the economy, maybe it's just a factor of restaurant age) service and food quality are slipping a little.\n\nDon't get sloppy, Xochitl.  We're counting on you for a 5 star visit when we return.\n\nAnd I will return (not sure about my friend though.)."

Hanger steak was very good, although the sauce (same as on empanada) was just okay.  Wife enjoyed the chicken.  Beans and rice were good. Tortillas were mass produced and microwaved.

My friend's mom asked them for their classic margarita recipe and she makes them at home now - so good. I got a taco salad which was pretty average, but I was hangry that day and devoured it. The custom guacamole is WAY over priced for the little amount the serve you (I ate mine with like the 5 tortilla chips they served).

My wife did find her scallops ceviche enjoyable, though forgetable. I ordered the ensalada for my third course, and was very underwelmed. My wife ordered the empanadas which were delicious, but there was a very smoky sauce over them that I did not enjoy. My wife and I both loved our entrees: the chicken carnitas and hanger steak. The tortillas were authentic, and the flavor was excellent. My only complaint was the return of that smoky sauce to the hanger steak. The desserts, the mango flan and apple crisp manzano were equally delicious. My biggest disappointment was the choice of music in the restaurant. They played everyday American music, instead of sexy, sensual Latin music that would have complimented their authentic dishes."

We were there for restaurant week a little while ago, and while there are several reasons that it could have been a disappointing experience, the service and food really pulled through.\n\nFirst, even though the entire party was there on time for our 8pm reservation, we weren't seated until 50 minutes after our reservation. This could have been quite terrible, but after 25 minutes of waiting we brought it to the attention of the hostess, and the owner quickly stepped in and gave us a round of free drinks at the bar and free guacamole/chips. Since our major complaint was hunger and we weren't worried about the time, this was perfect.\n\nAfter being seated, we received exceptional service by the waiter. Restaurant week is always busy for any nice restaurant, but he was patient and answered all of our questions. Everyone loved everything they ordered, particularly the pork dishes. \n\nThe best part of the service was dessert. I am allergic to dairy, and while I thought that wouldn't be a problem on the menu, turns out it was. The owner stopped by and made sure I got a special dessert that's not even on the regular menu, just so I could have something to eat with the party.\n\nI can't comment on prices as other reviewers have done as I was there for restaurant week, and they don't have their regular menu during that time."

Someone who seemed to be more senior kept jumping in to help out and badgered us to order more food - showing clear displeasure when we did not order entrees!  We ordered  8 appetizers and mind you a couple of rounds of drinks!  I have never had a problem with this approach before unless it's fine dining.

Upon our arrival, there was a short wait to have out table ready even though we had reservations.  I didn't mind as it was only a few minutes.\n\nOur waiter informed us that the restaurant was under new management since our last visit, and now had a new chef.  That made sense, as the menu was very different from what I had remembered.\n\nDrinks- Michelada was heavy on the tomato juice.  The bartender mistakenly put cilantro in the Amarillo, but that was quickly remedied with no issue.\n\nAppetizer - Red Snapper Ceviche was not like any ceviche I have had before, and was more raw than what I would expect, but still was good.\n\nEntree - Short Rib was bland.  The vegetables on the plate stood out more than the meat.  Camarrones con Caldo - a bit on the spicy side, but the shrimp was cooked perfectly.\n\nDessert - Didn't bother.  The churros I had on my first visit were no longer on the menu, and I couldn't imagine anyone could make them as good as they were before.\n\nOverall, the food was decent, but certainly nowhere near what it used to be.

The beef brisket was delicious, but the other parts of the taco (pickled veggies) were not good.

By the time we sat down to dinner 20 minutes later (they won't seat you until your entire party has arrived - fine) the place was packed and so loud we couldn't hear our waiter scream the specials at us.\n\nThe food was ok.  The idea to customize the guacomole, as other reviewers have said, is pretty awesome.  However, for $9 plus add-ons, the portion size would barely have satisfied a party of 3.  I'll stick with El Vez, which is pricey, but there's plenty to go around.  \n\nI think everyone was relatively happy with their entrees, though we all thought the portions were skimpy for the prices.  My short rib was fine, needed some more sauce but we never saw our server to ask.  The shrimp dish was well-received except for the fact that the avocado salad was more like chopped cilantro with a few avocado chunks.  \n\nAs far as drinks go, I was excited because their menu reads like a delicious and tasty adventure.  I didn't find my margarita particularly strong, I ordered the El Pepino, and for the amount of spice that was in that thing I would have expected a lot more kick in the tequila department.  I mean, I've had jalapeno infused tequilas on multiple occasions but this was like actually drinking liquid jalapeno.  The Perfect Marg that my friend ordered however was pretty good and the other girls did like the Sangria. \n\nFinally, the service we felt was pretty substandard.  All of us girls have worked for many years as servers and bartenders so we're a pretty understanding crowd.  Our waiter was busy, no doubt, and that's something I always make allowances for.  But literally no one checked on us.  At least pop your head over and ask if we need anything.  Or send someone else to do it.  The poor bus girl was running around trying to do her best but it was clear that she was overwhelmed.  The one saving grace was the chatty female bartender.  Super nice and friendly, which is what you want when you walk into a restaurant for the first time.\n\nOverall I wouldn't be tempted back to this place.  Everything, from drinks to dinners was way overpriced.  I love eating, I don't have an issue paying more if the food and drinks are great.  But they weren't.  At other restaurants in this price range you get much more bang for your buck.  And there are so many fantastic restaurants in Philly that you don't need to revisit the disappointing ones."

So, we couldn't remember much about it last week, when we finished our dance lesson at Society Hill Dance Academy famished. Granted, we are vegetarian and perhaps are missing Xochitl's star dishes. But I largely stand by my original impression. \n\nThe place was nearly deserted, which ought to have tipped us off. However, it was such a welcome change from our prior experience (a crowded Friday night), that we enjoyed the quiet. Our waiter was friendly enough, although the bartender who seated us looked at his watch as soon as we walked in.  \n\nWe started with the Xochitl salad, which had the potential to be good. If it wasn't incredibly salty. I suspected, and our waiter confirmed, that the kitchen forgot the lime dressing. Bad when the restaurant is busy. Regrettable when the restaurant is nearly empty and you have a full kitchen staff. But UNFORGIVABLE when it is nearly empty, you have a full kitchen staff, AND you realize the mistake and don't take it off the bill.  \n\nFor dinner, my friend ordered the Huarache de Hongos, with seasonal vegetables instead of the usual mix of mushroom and artichoke. I liked it better than he did, so we ended up switching plates. \n\nI ordered the mushroom tamale. I am not a big fan of tamales in general but it was one of the few vegetarian options and I decided to give it a shot. It was inexplicably deconstructed - which a tamale should, in my opinion, NEVER be - because it was a few slices of bland corn mush with a dollop of the mushroom \"filling\" on the side. \n\nIt is a good thing we are trying to diet, because the portion sizes were tiny for the price. \n\nThe drinks were better than the food. The Xochitl margarita was tart and freshly prepared - the way I like it - and the Mexican mojito was crisp and refreshing. But my glass was 90% ice.

The pollo frito was some of the best fried chicken I've had and came drizzled with some heavenly BBQ-like sauce. The accompanying creamed spinach even impressed my non-spinach-loving dining partner. My short rib was tender, flavorful, and paired perfectly with the rice and veggies it came with. Finally, dessert was a sensual experience for me. Some sort of chocolate cake with whipped cream and a fancy drizzle and a chocolate powdered X. Wine courses were all on point but let's just say I've never really met a wine that I didn't like.\n\nAlso- we were pretty much the only two people in the restaurant while we ate, so our server let us get two happy hour priced margs at our table, even though the specials usually only apply to those sitting at the bar."

For that level of restaurant I was expecting my tacos served on Handmade tortillas that's really a plus on real authentic tacos, I strongly recommend to check your acidity on the Ceviche you need to balance that my ceviche was overpowering by the olive oil, the Tlacoyo was ok I don't know if you are using Spanish Chorizo or Italian sausage but one thing is for sure that was not Mexican Chorizo ..\nKeep working hard guys you git a really nice spot but definitely need to improve on your food"

I was nearly scared off by the hit or miss reviews, as it appears most people either love or hate this place.  \n\nI'm firmly in the love category, because this was one of the better dining experiences we've had in a while.  Upon arriving, we were seated at the best table in the house:  the little two-top in front of the curved window, which I though was charming.  Our server was spot-on, attentive, and friendly all night, and she even let us swap out margaritas for the straight tequila flights.  Call me whatever you like, but I can't stand warm tequila shots (my stomach churns just writing the words).  They were overly accommodating and that always elevates a nice dinner, particularly when it involves some tasty margaritas.\n\nThe \"build your own guacamole\" is a great, fun idea to start off any meal, and theirs is one of the best.  The habanero option is the spiciest, but I found it to be just the right amount of heat on the back end.  The mushroom torta/pizza second course was also very good, and it appears that they took the criticism in other reviews into consideration.  There was no massive, sloppy salad on top of ours.  Instead, it was a perfect sprinkling of micro greens.\n\nFor our mains, we chose the braised short rib and red snapper on the recommendation of our server.  It was a great choice, because they were both excellent.  I might have to agree with some other Yelpers who have complained about lack of spice and salt.  Both dishes were borderline bland for Mexican cuisine, but the proteins were cooked perfectly and enough flavor came through.\n\nThe dessert was a wonderful way to finish this meal.  The chocolate tres leche cake was light, flavorful and perfectly plated.  It was just the right size to share after a filling meal.  I might normally opt for four stars, but the service bumps this one up a star."

He's a huge fan of foodies and claims we're exactly why he's in the business.  Makes sense, this guy knows how to please a foodie.\n\n The atmosphere was really nice. Our group of 19 fit perfectly in the comfortable lounge-like dining room down stairs. The problem I had was trying to figure what to order. Fortunately, we were a sharing group and most of us were able to experience one great flavor after another. You'll see that our flickr photos are a bit more scarce this time....due to the fact that those with cameras were too consumed with consuming.\n\n Honestly, I found the entire experience to be flawless. In my opinion, everything I tasted was even more exciting than how it read on the menu, which is quite an accomplishment. The vegetarian entree (stuffed cactus) was perhaps the most interesting thing I sampled and hope to get the opportunity to order that in future visits to the restaurant (hint,hint), but I suspect that that dish was put together especially for us, though I was told cactus is always on the menu.\n\nA BIG THANKS to Steven Cook, owner of Xochitl & Marigold, who has proven to be one of the most eager to host food-ies. He clearly appreciates his patrons and came in to see how our meal was and more importantly, he was among the easiest to organize events with. The staff service was excellent and Im not just spreading all this love because they make a damn strong drink there, no sir, it's because I can be influenced by a good food buzz.\n\nthe menu: (for those curious)\n\n1st Course (choose one)\nCeviche de Dorado y Coco\n(Mahi-Mahi ceviche with coconut)\n\nEmpanadas de Pollo con Mole\n(Chicken empanadas with mole)\n\n*( veggie offer) Sopes de Queso de Cabra\nFresh masa tortillas with goat cheese and black beans\n\n\n2nd Course (choose one)\nJicama Callejera\n(Jicama in the style of the Street, with pepino\nmelon, pineapple, lime and chile piquin)\n\nSalpicon de Res\n(Shredded beef salad with tomato,\nonion, cilantro, jalapeno and lime)\n\nEntree (choose one)\nBistec Tabasqueno\n(Skirt steak with plantains, guacamole and beans)\n\nPechuga Rellena de Queso y Flor de Calabaza\n(Chicken breast stuffed with ricotta cheese and\nzucchini flowers with roasted poblano sauce)\n\nSalmon en Salsa de Aguacate\n(Roasted salmon with avocado sauce)\n\n*(vegetarian entree) Nopales Rellenos\nRoasted cactus stuffed with mushrooms served with pumpkin seed mole\n\nDessert (choose one)\nBurritos de Platano con Chocolate\n(Banana burritos with chocolate sauce)\n\nBunuelos Napoleon\n(Fritters layered with fresh cream and berries)"

Not all the way down, but far enough down that I'm unable to give you more than three stars.\n\nBuild-your-own-guacamole is an awesome idea, and I loved doing it.  Black truffle, red onion, cotija cheese, roasted garlic and jalapeno.... yes.  Yes yes yes yes yes.  Incredibly delicious, and the chips with it were spot-on.  A fantastic start.\n\nAnd the drinks were great!  I got a terrific tequila recommendations from the manager, my girlfriend grabbed a terrific \"blood orange martini\" and we followed that with what is now my favorite red sangria in the city (taking over for Bar Ferdinand, for those of you keeping score); it's got sweetness to it but finishes nice and dry, exactly what I like in a sangria.\n\nThe rest of the meal, unfortunately, was not as successful.\n\n- Carnitas Tacos: the tortillas were perfect, and the flavors were there... but the pork was dry, and that's just not ok when the dish is 90% pork.\n\n- Short Rib Tamale: I *love* tamales with a passion.  But this was not a tamale, this was a deconstructed tamale, and it didn't succeed for me because the deconstruction lost that essential masa-to-filling ratio which makes the tamale essentially a cornmeal dish.  The masa was lost in the sea of sauce and onions and short rib.  I want to be clear here, this dish was absolutely delicious, and the short rib was cooked to absolute perfection... but I wanted a tamale, and this really wasn't one.\n\n- Pollo Frito:  I also *love* fried chicken, and the menu made it pretty clear this one's made with lots of care.  But unfortunately it wasn't what I was looking for.  The chicken was tender enough, but the way it's fried was just not appealing to me, it needed more seasoning, a little too fluffy and flaky, plus it slid right off the meat with the first forkful and had to be eaten like a side.  I'm having trouble putting my finger on what didn't work for me about this dish... but on the whole it just wasn't that amazing fried chicken I was looking for.\n\n- Esquites:  Now *this* was fantastic.  Mexican street corn, with lots of flavor and melted cotija cheese.  Absolutely fantastic.\n\nAgain, I have to explain just to be clear and fair that the short rib tamale is totally delicious and we devoured it... just don't go into it expecting a tamale.  And the guac and esquites were both fantastic... but the other entrees left me wanting.  I'd have expected more quality at this price point, particularly when I've been spoiled by the delicious, perfect and affordable carnitas tacos at Cantina Dos Segundos!"

When the meal arrived, 1 was enough to feed 3 of us and needless to say, neither of us finished. Then as the waitress cleared our plates, she had the nerve to say \"Oh yeah, we give huge portions!\". I'm sorry, but that's just dirty business. I understand they are running a business, but in a party of 13, it was completely rude and unjust for them to give us false information in order to make more money. \n\nTo top it all off, the chicken we ordered was dry and hard as a rock when we bit into it. Swing and a miss, Xochitl."

Street corn was good, but would like to have it as corn on the cob instead of corn kernels. Yucca fries were very tasty as well. A negative for the restaurant is the noise volume.

Xochitl fits in that bucket perfectly.\n\nI liked the atmosphere of this place and I like having a slightly classier place to hang out in Headhouse Sq.  The drinks were good (although I felt the margarita to ice ratio was a bit off for the price... but maybe I was just drinking too quickly) and the food was tasty.  But the price was just a bit too high.   Now I know that people would choose Xochitl over one of the Italian Market tacquerias due to nicer presentation, nicer atmosphere, and (slightly) better quality.  But for $14 for three tacos, I just expected more.  I will say that the \"make your own guacamole\" is a cool idea, and we tried some carnitas taquitos that were super delicious.  \n\nSo to sum it up, I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here (unless the prices are dropped), but I did enjoy my meal and had a nice time at this establishment.  I'd maybe check it out again for their happy hour specials."

I hadn't really heard too much about this spot and didn't bother to look up their menu online or else I would have been prepared for the small menu choices. This is definitely not a traditional Mexican (in America) restaurant. No burritos. No enchiladas. Ay dios mio! Since most of the items were a little suspect to me I went with the fail safe of Arroz con pollo frito ($18). It was BORING and BLAND. There was absolutely no seasoning on the chicken and the rice was so wet it made the so called fried chicken soggy. \n\nI will say the highlight for me was the guacamole ($8). They bring out all the ingredients and prepare it for you by your table. That was pretty fun to watch and it was super delicious with the warm tortilla chips. The drinks (margaritas and sangrias) were good too. Some people ordered the churros and I would say don't waste your $8 on those. \n\nOnce the bill came we were shocked to see it had reached $253.

I walk by the sign on my commute home every day and it sounded awesome.  \n$2 Drafts\n$5 Margaritas\n$5 Appetizers\nI was desperate for some Mexican food last night and decided to go here.  The restaurant was pretty empty for a weekday night but I will give you the breakdown.    \nSituational:\nThe Service - The waiter was a little out of his depth and by that I mean, he may have been new or just covering for someone who was not there.  Anyway, my biggest gripe is that he didn't recommend the Molcajete dinner or even mention it as an option and it is not on the menu but a card that was hidden under a candle in the middle of the table.  It was a much better deal and would have been ideal.   \n\nThe Good:\nBuild You Own Guacamole - This is a pretty amazing and was executed to perfection.   It was delicious and I enjoyed it a lot.  \nThe Bar/Happy Hour - The happy hour specials are only for bar patrons, so this place is probably better as a happy hour spot than anything else. \nThe Drinks - The Tequila menu is excellent and the drinks are pretty good as well.  \n\nThe Bad:  \nThe Rice - I had the steak and it came with this rice that was just terrible tasting.  If you get the Steak I would recommend changing this accompaniment to something else.\nThe Price - All of the main dinner entrees are about 20% more than other comparable Mexican Restaurants in Philadelphia."

The margaritas were very good - both the standard house Xochitl margarita and the blood orange one. That's about where it stopped, though. They took forever to arrive at the table. The vegetable enchiladas were underwhelming. Not even warm enough! And very bland. The brisket tacos were confusing, as they were labeled \"very spicy\" yet tasted as bland as could be. The Mexican rice would have been at home in any elementary school lunch line. I've had better rice from frozen plastic bags at the supermarket. The service was slow, it took forever to get our dirty dishes cleared. The waitress was nice and polite, so I can't complain about that. It's not her fault the food sucked. Another couple near us actually left without paying because the food was so bad. Overall, I'd have to give this place a D+ for the food. I suppose I would give the margaritas an A-. I would really only consider coming here again for margaritas, but it's not worth it unless you happen to live in the area. If you know what real, good Mexican food tastes like, this place will disappoint you."

The tortilla soup was delicious, with fantastic presentation and varied texture. Sadly, they were out of blood oranges for my salad and had to substitute grapefruit, which really changed and dulled the flavor. I had the vegetarian mixiote de vegetales, and while the presentation was top notch, and the vegetables themselves were deliciously seasoned and crispy-fresh, in the end they were just veggies. Some protein would really add to the dish. I also had a lovely pineapple cake desert with a crisp cilantro-pineapple sorbet. \n\nA few more touches could really make this place stellar. I think the decor in the dining room could be a bit more plentiful (maybe 6 + plates clustered on a wall instead of a lonely two) a few more exciting vegetarian options, and MAN that bathroom is small. I'm just 5'2\" and my knees were almost hitting the wall! Our service was a little inconsistent, too.

That was a major disappointment because that is definitely a draw to any restaurant. We did get to customize our guac which is really a neat thing to do, especially with the tons of options they offered. Im a purist so we went simply with onions, tomato, cilantro, jalapeno and cotija cheese. Decent guac, but nothing really memorable.\n\nOur drinks werent really very good either. My margarita was pretty flavorless. My fiances drink was ok, but again nothing worth noting.\n\nNext course offered us a choice of huarache de hongos, ahi tuna ceviche or a salad. We went with the huarache de hongos and the ahi tuna salad, but by the looks of the plates, it looked like we got the salads on top of both of them. The huarache de honogos was a mushroom flatbread topped with seared wild mushrooms, artichoke hearts, and manchego and cotija cheese. what they didnt tell us in the description was that there was a mini salad on top of flatbread that covered the entire thing so you couldnt see anything underneath of it. It was far too much, and it really took flavor away from the flatbread. If I wanted to eat a salad, I would have ordered a salad. I really couldnt believe they did the same exact thing with the ceviche. The ceviche itself really wasnt very good, as it tasted more like tuna in tomato sauce with little no no heat and terrible texture, so manye that is why they layered the salad on top. It had no business being there, especially in that amount.\n\nLuckily the mains faired a bit better. I ordered the shrimp chile nogada, why it wasnt all in spanish is beyond me, but it was fairly tasty. I love stuffed poblano peppers in all forms, and this was pretty good, even though the shrimp was kind of lost. If you had told me it was just filled with cheese, I never would have known the difference. My fiances camarones con caldo wasnt nearly as good. The shrimp were pretty good, but the sauce was very sweet and really didnt pack enough flavor. The avocado salad was nice.\n\nDessert was the best part of the meal for us. WHile we dont usually like tres leches cakes, this particular version of a chocolate tres leches cake was actually very good. It was creamy and rich and delicious. The vanilla flan was however the star. It was cheesy and bursting with vanilla flavor. It had a really nice caramel sauce served with it too. \n\nI really wish I could have tried this place when Michael Solomonov still owned it. I can imagine how exponentially better it would have been. Ill stick to my other Mexican favorites. This one missed the mark for me."

I flagged down a waiter who was busily moving about with dishes bound for a table downstairs. He informed us that they didn't have a hostess at that hour, but would get us seated shortly.  And indeed he did.\n\nWe've been to Xochitl a couple times before.  We had previously returned because it had the best chicken torta in the city, but then that item fell off the menu, no where to be found.  The revamped menu was OK, but not good enough to go all the way out east just for it.  Since we were nearby that night and hungry, we dropped by to give it another chance.  I'm glad we did.\n\nWe had the make-your-own guac with Spanish onions, roasted tomatoes, cojito, truffle oil, and a pepper whose name I can't remember.  I thought this was so-so and was missing a little bit of something.  But, this wasn't the restaurant's fault since it was us who picked the ingredients.  Shame on us.\n\nWe split the Pollo Frito - a half chicken that was brined for 24 hours, steamed, fried, and drizzled with sweet chile sauce.  It was paired with corn bread and spinach in a chile cream.  The chicken was fried perfectly, with the sweet chile sauce serving as a good contrast to the spicier chile cream of the spinach.  Definitely a repeat to be had.\n\nWe also had the fish tacos - achiote lime marinated walu fish layered with mexican slaw and wrapped in house made tortillas.  I'm not normally a fan of fish tacos as the flavors are often more bland.  The flavors of these tacos weren't bland, but just more subtle.  Another repeat to be had.\n\nThe only big service miss was that our guac came out late because there was confusion in the kitchen regarding whether we already got it or not (we didn't). \n\nOverall, a nice comeback Xochitl."

The food was fine...the guacamole was nothing special but the queso fundido was freaking amazing...my husband got the short ribs, I, the salmon.  Our friends got something we never would get so I completely forget but they seemed pleased.  I honestly could have done without my entree as could my husband and just gotten another order of queso fundido.  It was your typical \"I'm trying to be really unique and interesting but really I've used too much sauce and spice for this to be that awesome\" fare.  Pretty pricey...service was good."

We ordered guacamole for the table that came in a heaping pile and was fresh and tasty. For appetizers, I got a dish that was essentially a small pizza that was topped with mushrooms and chicken. It was decent and filling, but very greasy. My friend was not pleased with her empanadas appetizer. For my entree, I got shrimp in a poblano pepper smothered in cheese. The taste of the cheese was overwhelming, and unfortunately the cheese wasn't anything special. My friends that got the short ribs were disappointed with the lack of flavor in their dishes too. We got a bottle of hot sauce, and it helped a lot. I'm not one to love spicy foods, but I need a little bit of flavor. My friend who got the steak and potatoes enjoyed her food (though what Mexican place serves steak and potatoes?)\n\nI'd maybe come back for tacos & drinks, but I wouldn't bother with the high prices of restaurant week."

The manager and waiter would check on other tables but not ours--even though they were continuously passing us. \n\nSo, we ordered the \"award-winning\" guacamole and two different ceviches. The guacamole was disappointing and the ceviches were not fresh. I took a small spoonful of ceviche and was overwhelmed by a fishy taste, so I decided to send it back.\n\nAfter flailing my arms for 15 minutes to get my waiter's attention, I asked if I could switch out the ceviche for something else. He took the ceviche away and informed me that I would have to pay the price for the new dish. I said that was fine and then said I needed time to decide on a new item, he never returned for the order until I had to flag him down again, and by that time I was unimpressed and fed up with the whole establishment that I just asked for the check so my boyfriend and I could leave. \n\nI ended up having to still pay for the one bite of bad ceviche that I had,the ceviche my boyfriend got and didn't like, the saddest guacamole I have ever eaten to date, and included tip even though I received poor service from the staff."

They allow you to customize the guacamole to your liking and, if you can't decide between the many options, the servers offer will their pairing suggestions. So fresh and homemade tasting, I'm not even a guac fan and I practically licked the bowl clean! The margaritas were similarly delicious... a perfect pairing. As for the entrees, I wasn't completely impressed. I ordered the steak tacos and also tasted the short rib tamales. Nothing was wrong, just expected a little more for what they were charging. I will say that the Mexican corn was great. When I've had it in the past, it's been served on the cobb, which is extremely messy and difficult to eat. Xochitl serves it cut up and in a bowl so you don't have to worry about a cheesy mess all over your face. I had an enjoyable evening, but will probably return just for happy hour."

It was good, the guacamole is customizable which is cool, although you have to pay for mix-ins after a certain point. The base guacamole they give you is only avocado, lime and evoo, so three is enough to get you red onions, cilantro and garlic to make it actual guac. \n\nFor appetizer I had the Huarache de Hongos which was something like a cotija cheese and mushroom flatbread. It was definitely tasty, and really large compared to the empanadas. \n\nFor my entree I got Camarones Con Caldo on recommendation by the waiter. It was tasty but not out of the ordinary. It was like 6 or 7 regular sized spicy shrimps. It said it came with \"avocado salad\" but it was really just cilantro salad with a few tiny pieces of avocado in it. It did come with fried plantains though, which will always get extra points for me. \n\nOne of my friends got the salmon, which was good but also not out of the ordinary. The other got the flat iron steak which was probably the best (if you like steak) of the three. It was thicker than most flat iron steaks and cooked perfectly (asked for medium rare). \n\nWe got the white sangria...which came with ice. It had tequila in it which kind of overpowered the wine, and when I said ice, they give you a LOT of ice so that by the time you've finished unless you're sucking it down really quickly it's pretty diluted. \n\nFor dessert I had the flan, which I didn't really care for at all (and I love flan normally). The flavors were just off and kind of strange. The chocolate cake was nothing like our waiter described, but it was awesome I should have gotten that. And then the churros were freshly fried and came with a good sauce."

My entree was actually delicious, I had the stuffed chicken but the second I put the last bite in my mouth I ran straight to the bathroom which is tiny and next door to the kitchen and got so sick. My boyfriend also got sick about an hour later. He had the surf and turf which was a small filet mignon with all the sinews still in it and a lobster tail with no flavor.

We had only even gone to get the well-advertised February Dinner and Cocktail Special. I guess they didn't get their memo: there were no specials offered. So, we settled for some regular menu items. After we ordered, she let us know that the meals would take a really long time to come out, so we'd probably want to order the Guacamole. This she said to every table. Having been underwhelmed by the serving size of the Guacamole on my previous visit, I declined. After 30 minutes, our entrees finally surfaced. They weren't bad, but they were nothing to write home about. And especially for the price, the portions left much to be desired.

I understand that sometimes patrons refuse to leave, which is out of the restaurant's control, but that's something they should account for when booking reservations. Also, the hostess had kind of a nasty attitude when we inquired politely about our table after 30 minutes of waiting. She offered to send down the manager, who was apologetic and gave us complimentary margaritas and guacamole, so at least he was nice and the gesture was appreciated. One star for the nice manager who gave us free stuff. \n\nHowever, waiting 40 minutes for our table was only the beginning of a long night of waiting. Service was extremely slow and each course took forever to arrive. The waitress was pleasant enough, but didn't stop by to say something like, \"I'm sorry for the wait, your food should be out shortly.\" The bussers did their job pretty well, though. \n\nThe food itself was mediocre. The guacamole was decent, but not amazing. It was comparable to the guacamole you can buy at Trader Joe's, which is good but also costs a fraction of the price. I was excited to try the ceviche appetizer, but it was unimaginative and even tasted kind of sour (in a bad way) and funky, which is not good when it comes to raw fish. This made me sad because I love both mackerel and ceviche. The braised short rib entree was good; it was probably the only thing that impressed me (this is where the other star comes from). My dining companions were not thrilled with their scallop or pork dishes, though. The desserts were not even worth mentioning, but I will anyway. The churros were dry and hard and tasted like 3-month-old stale donut sticks sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. The tres leches was bland with a weird frosting and a \"pear compote\" which was more like a few pieces of canned Del Monte diced pears. Overall, it was an underwhelming experience with slow service, a hostess with an attitude problem, and average food."

It was really neat to watch the waiter make our guacamole in front of our eyes.

Cilantro and some jalapeno are mashed into the guacamole; don't be afraid of the jalapeno, you won't feel the spiciness.\n\nSo this is one of those places where if you sit in the dining room, you won't be able to take advantage of the happy hour special.

        "text": "Though my meal was very good, I'm evaluating Xochitl against restaurants in the league in which it wants to play. And it missed the mark on several notes. I won't write it off, but the inconsistency I experienced, even in a single visit has me feeling let down by the experience overall.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were looking for a new-to-us restaurant to try, and we ventured down to Headhouse Square where there were several choices we were considering. Xochitl seemed cozy & inviting, but that was ripped from us almost immediately, as the too-cool-for-school host greeted us with a sneer when we said we didn't have reservations. Dude, it was 9:00pm on a Saturday night, you had plenty of tables open--and we wouldn't have minded a wait. Lose the 'tude.\n\nWe were encouraged to try the tasting menu (note fyi: others on the site have mentioned a $35 price tag. Either costs have gone up, or Saturday's menu is different, but the tasting menu was $45): a 5-course selection including guacamole for the table, an appetizer, ceviche, main course, and dessert. IMO, it's an excellent value, but my response to the food shifted fairly drastically from course to course.\n\nThe guacamole had all the right elements, but fell somewhat flat. It needed a kick, and since it's prepared tableside, I wish our preparer had either stuck around, or checked back in with us to see if the seasoning needed adjusting. \n\nMy appetizer was the Ensalada Xochitl. YUM! Avocado, papaya, watermelon and fennel salad with tequila vinaigrette... refreshing and absolutely delicious. Our server also brought out an amuse bouche: a single grilled scallop atop a slice of watermelon, also grilled. I expected the melon to be cold, and sweet. Grilling it brought out a sour taste, which wasn't a bad complement to the scallop; it was just a flavor that took me by surprise.\n\nMy ceviche was a trio served on tostadas: shrimp, octopus, and mackerel. The mackerel was very disappointing, but the other two were quite good. \n\nMy main course was phenomenal--Pescado al Pastor: a black bass served with a plaintain pancake and a rice that was citrus scented, and delicious. The plaintain felt like kind of an afterthought; it neither added nor detracted from the dish. However, I was very pleased with this dish, if I came back for this and the salad, I might be looking at Xochitl as a 4-star joint.\n\nDessert. Yummy. Churros for the bf, served with two dipping sauces: mexican chocolate and cajeta, and a carmelized bananas dish with vanilla/walnut ice cream for me. This was a nice finish to the meal, although I was surprised I still had room at this point.\n\nAside from the food, there were other details that were inconsistent as they pertain to service, presentation, and atmosphere. Service was generally good, but for its level, I would expect a little more. Our server was very attentive, guiding us through the menu and making an earnest attempt to tell us about each dish she set before us. However, she was so soft-spoken, I couldn't hear a word. A few times we asked her to repeat herself; I even cupped my ear to try to give her a polite, but explicit cue that I couldn't hear, but to no avail. We gave up. The dishes were beautifully presented--every single one of them. But, the plates have a busy pattern that competes with its presentation. These are small details, but with such artistry in the food, why not just set it off on a simple canvas? The atmosphere is so nicely appointed and inviting... but the attitude of the host, who is responsible for initially setting the tone, was obnoxious. Xochitl also doesn't seem to be very decisive about how it wants its guests to dress: the club vibe from the lounge suggests one thing; the low key, intimate bar setting another; and the dim lighting of the dining room yet another. My date and I, as well as the majority of diners while we were there, were dressed casually.\n\nI didn't check out the downstairs, but it sounded like a bustling lounge that would be fun to hang out in, and the bar area looks like a great spot to visit. I want to give this place another chance, but bottom line: I'm not sure I'll be rushing back so fast to do so."

Like the other reviews, I recommend starting with the \"build your own quacamole\" and a fresh squeezed lime/ house made simple syrup margarita. For entrees, the pollo frito was the star of the evening -- delightful. The chicken was brined, steamed and fried so the final result wasn't the least bit greasy, yet crispy, and flavorful. The creamed spinach side dish was also amazing. We even placed another order for the pollo frito as we decided to bring it to a guest who had to cancel last minute.The staff is very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about mexican cuisine. Last but not least, the ambiance is great. Overall, a wonderful dining experience!"

The guacamole made your way is a cute touch, and very fresh.  Margarita selection is delightful.  I had blood orange, which was delish.  The ambiance in this little restaurant \"feels\" Central American.  Very pleasant, not too loud.  Service was very quick and efficient.  I liked this place, but still seeking my favorite Mexican restaurant in Philly....."

It was great for salsa style dancing (mexican or peruvian style ;-)\nDo Not: get margaritas? My margarita aficionado for the evening was not all that impressed.\nDo: drink the tequila, with a chaser. I forget what it was called, but it was a spicy tomato juice. I swear with that stuff as the chaser I could have finished a whole bottle of tequila... not that I would.\nDo Not: let the man get you down (or the crowd). The night I went there seemed to be two distinct crowds. One group was the dancing type (my friends and I were part of that group) and the other group was determined to stare and glower at us (they were jealous). If you want to dance, dance.

For my main I got the chicken enchiladas and they were great. Really nice flavor and a good amount of spice. I didn't care for the rice that came with them, and I told the waiter who then comped one of our drinks. The service was great. My boyfriend had the steak and charizo tacos and he enjoyed them. For dessert we split the flan and tres leches cake and both were tasty. \nFor drinks, we tried the xochitl marg, the spicy pepino marg, the prickly pear marg, and a drink with pineapple and cinnamon. They were all really good. Not strong alcohol wise though. \nWe would definitely come back!"

They said we couldn't order happy hour drinks at the table so I went up to the bar to order the drinks for my party. (Why they make this arbitrary rule, no one knows.) Anyway I order the 3 drinks at the bar and the manager comes up to me and tells me he will give me these drinks on happy hour but any other drinks will need to be ordered from the table where there isn't happy hour. Mind you the drinks come from the same bar. This obviously rubs me the wrong way to begin with. \n\nNext, my mom and I order tacos. They were mediocre. This is a Mexican restaurant so we order a side of salsa each for our  bland tacos. The waitress says nothing about an additional charge at this point or that she recommend we get one since the sizes are large. She brings out 2 pretty large containers of salsa which we only use a scoop of each. Once the bill comes out we realize she charged us $4 for salsa. We point out the $4 charge to our waitress who then says \"you wanted it didn't you?\" Since she couldn't handle the situation she brings her manager out (same guy as before). He proceeds to argue over this salsa surcharge.... Naming other restaurants that charge for salsa and chips. I'm in shock at this point. When he finally realizes that we ordered side salsa and she charged us for the menu price of 2 salsa and chip containers he starts to back away from his argument. \n\nCharging for salsa is one thing but not being transparent, nickel and dimming your customers and poor customer service with poor performing food is another."

        "text": "There was a lot of amazing food at Xochitl.  I think it's sin is that I trusted them to lead me through a culinary experience... after all it was on their menu to try a five course meal.  But I am getting ahead of myself.\n\nWanted to try something new we hit the little strip near the Open Air Market in Old City. As is the norm when I visit there it was snowing. We showed up reservation-less at Xochitl and were \"greeted\" by an angry hipster who clearly didn't think we deserved to be there.  Ok - no reservation - but we were also the second to last table seated that night... and there were several open tables... including SEVERAL that would have been much nicer than the one we got... but I digress.\n\nThe menu looked good - if maybe lacking in description.  It was clear this was because the wait staff wanted to tell us about the preparations.  We ordered the 5 course deal - for me it was guacamole made at the table, A trio of tamales, a tuna ceviche, the Aztec skirt steak, and a dessert to be named later.\n\nNow - I'll point out before I continue - I'm a white boy... but I'm a white boy who lived in Texas for a few years.  I may not be able to pronounce this stuff - but I now what it all is... and I don't think I would have navigated this menu AT ALL if I hadn't known what it all was.  But I digress.\n\nGuac came out first.  Apparently \"made to order at the table\" means \"prepared at the table\" as I felt it needed more salt and probably peppers if my date was ok with the heat - but old boy folded up his dish tray before I got to find out how it was.  But it was while we were waiting for the guac that the first real taste of this chef came out - a complimentary taste of scallop on watermelon.  Very complex, very tasty. The cooked watermelon took on an almost sour quality that paired well with whatever they put on it.\n\nWhich brings me to my next gripe - the waitress tried to tell me how it was prepared - but I couldn't hear a thing.  There were two separate music tracks going on - one downstairs, one up, and between that, the crowd and the speed that the waitress tried to explain (bless her) I didn't get any of it.  I tried to follow but couldn't and after twice trying to figure out how something was made gave up and decided to just enjoy.\n\nUp next - the tamales - which weren't tamales as I'd ever had them - more slices of a small loaf of corn bread with filling laced in.  They were good - but I preferred the Xochitl salad my GF went with.  Again - complex and tasty - but not really what I was looking for when I ordered tamales.\n\nNext the Tuna ceviches.  VERY tasty... and probably my favorite part of the meal.  A complex platter of savory and sweet.  My GF had the tostadas - which I think I might have preferred except that I wasn't a hige fan of the mackerel on that platter.\n\nFinally the main course.  Skirt steak was excellently prepared with a few different sauces and served with blue corn tortillas to wrap things up in.  As I wandered around the plate I enjoyed every bit of it separate - but as I began to combine things it had a sort of muttled effect.  At this point I think I was just tired of trying to distinguish so many ingredients in such complex plates.  I was also stuffed beyond imagination before the main course showed up.  I tasted my GFs black bass - the fish was AMAZING... but when I mixed another bite of the plantains and sauce I liked it less.  Again - I think both dishes woud have been AMAZING if I had had them in second course.\n\nFinally dessert was churros and chocolate (defined as churros with litle dishes of sauces) and a crowsie of my GFs caramelized bananna with walnut ice cream.  Both very delishious.  After the spice in the meal I needed the ice cream - and the two dishes together were fabulous.\n\nSo in the end - I am being fairly harsh on this place.  I'd say that every plate was great on it's own - it was teh combination where things broke down.  There were also issues where some of the fried foods tasted like they had been left out a while before service... but I guess I expect that maybe showing up late to a dinner service.  But in the end - it felt like a $30 a plate service I paid $60 a plate for... so it's going to get compared to places I would pay that much at... and it simply doesn't match up.\n\nI think if I went back I would go with two courses and dessert and show up at the beginning of service.  I recommend you do the same.  I may give that a try - and if I do I'll update the 'ol Yelp review.\n\nFINAL NOTE: It felt like I should have been dressed better than I was... but everyone else was dressed casually too."

We went for restaurant week and despite what some here on the yelp say the service was not scaled back. \n\nThe hostess was very friendly, seated up promptly and took our jackets. I wasn't expecting a coat check. +1 for a great hostess and a coat check. It was cold as shit and I personally hate having to sit with my jacket pushed against my back. \n\nWe started with an awesome red sangria (it has tequila in it! w00t!) and they brought out some fresh baked warm and toasty bread (possibly the Xochitl take on pan de agua), with some regular butter and some sp!cy butter. At this point I was already head-over-heels.\n\nXochitl really went all out this year for restaurant week. Instead of the standard 3 courses for $35 Xochitl offers 4 courses for the same price. That earned them another +1. I started with the pollo con vegetales soup and it was a delight. My fianc\u00e9e had the corn soup with truffles and goat cheese. She won. That soup knocked my socks off and I want to go home and make it. \n\nNext up for me was the seafood ceviche. It was served tapas style on little fried corn cakes. There was one of each (Spanish mackerel, octopus, and shrimp) and they were tasty. I used to be the anti-ceviche guy, but after having great experiences at two places now, I am sold.  \n\nMain course is always my favorite course. I ordered the skirt steak medium and it came out medium. +1. It seems no one ever gets my steak right, but tonight Xochitl was running on all fours. The skirt was topped with a special salsa and had a side of pureed turnips. Everything on the plate complemented each other which of coarse is the way it's supposed to be. Often times when a sauce is added to a skirt, it's used to mask the quality of the beef. This was not the case. I tasted every flavor that this dish offered and there I decided that this place wasn't going to do me wrong.\n\nDessert: Churros w/ two pudding style dipping sauces. I was wow'd. I mean a churro isn't really anything special, and I am not really a dessert guy, but they were warm, tasty, and the little bit of chocolate dip was a great finish to a wonderful dining experience. \n\nXochitl earned itself a good 5 star rating from me. Ambiance was great, food was great, server was friendly, host was on point... It feels great to try out a new restaurant and be impressed. $35 for four courses makes it feel even better."

The hostess was very nice and genuinely apologetic, but clearly a little flustered by how busy they were - she shrugged and said that we could try to vie for a spot at the bar. Sadly, there were no spots to be had, so we ended up standing next to the bar for a good fifteen minutes until a table opened up. Unfortunately, the table was at the end of the bar, and we had camera flashes going off in our faces for quite a while because of a woman taking MySpace-style photos of herself and her friends. Obviously this wasn't Xochitl's fault, but it's difficult to separate it from the overall dining experience.\n\nI got a margarita, which was fabulous, and the guy I was with got an unusual (but tasty!) cocktail - I think it was the senor barriga. The queso fundido was delicious, and my entree was great (the mole de olla de cerdo - pork, pork, and more pork). \n\nWe ordered two desserts, and we received a complimentary third dessert because of our wait. Not quite free drinks, but still, it was a lovely gesture, and we ended up enjoying the free flan much more than the churros with warm goat's milk, which weren't nearly as luscious as they sounded.\n\nI think we'll return - the food was excellent, and the service was friendly, even if a little uneven."

I met up with my good friend Quinn for a Friday night dinner. The menu was exciting, three course plus house made guacamole.\n\nFor starters, the drink menu here is decent. There's a large list of house cocktails, a small wine list (36-42 per bottle) and a small, but decent beer list. Drafts are Negro Modello, Dos Eqius Amber and Lager, and Victory Prima Pils and they're all $5.\n\nThroughout the night, our service was just okay, but not what I'd expect of a restaurant this caliber. The one high point of the night though, is when a drink was spilled on our table, someone (the hostess, I think) came over within a minute to help clean up the small mess.\n\nAfter we ordered our drinks, someone came over and made our order of guacamole table-side. He used a fresh avocado and then asked what we wanted to be added in. We had him add everything, onions, cilantro, some spices, and a few others that I forget. It was good, but certainly not the best I've had.\n\nWe split the two appetizers The \"Cazuela de chorizo y papas\" (casserole of chorizo, potatoes, and kale\" sounded really excited but in reality was pretty bland. There's a lot of potential with these ingredients. The same can be said for our other app, the civiche.\n\nThe first main was pork tenderloin with Brussel sprouts and turnups. It was a little overdone for my taste, but Quinn really liked it. This dish was decent. Our other main was head on shrimp, and I liked this, but it still lacked a distinct flavor.\n\nDessert was my favorite part of the meal. I ordered churros and hot chocolate. The churcos were sweet and had a perfect texture. Dipping them in the chocolate was fantastic. Quinn ordered a coconut and quince pie. She liked it a lot, I thought it was okay, but I don't often go for coconut desserts.\n\nBottom Line: The whole night was good, but not remarkable. I'd rather go to a hole-in-the-wall Mexican place than a fancy one, and I don't even think Xochitl is doing the best Mexican. Still, if you find yourself here, you won't be disappointed."

The margaritas were made with fresh limes and chilled w/ crushed ice. I am not a great fan of saccharine sour mix that you would most likely get at a chilis or applebees so this was perfect for my taste buds. The queso fundido was different than anything i would get at a chain hispanic restaurant which are more cheese whiz like. I loved the chihuahua cheese and grilled peppers. The tortillas were piping hot and delicious. The platter could have maybe used some stronger flavors on the plate like some figs or roasted garlic (not both) to go with the mild flavor of the cheese. The bartender Nick was also very friendly and a good conversationalist. Overall - a great time with good drinks over a nice appetizer."

When he finally realizes that we ordered side salsa and she charged us for the menu price of 2 salsa and chip containers he starts to back away from his argument. \n\nCharging for salsa is one thing but not being transparent, nickel and dimming your customers and poor customer service with poor performing food is another."

Nice decor and an extremely nice and attentive server who tried to make conversation with us the whole night. The customized guacamole concept is nice. We had the chipotle chilis which gave a nice smoky flavor to it with roasted tomatoes, cilantro and onions and cheese and it was delicious and had a nice kick to it too. My brisket enchiladas were decent enough but a relatively large portion size. The random onions potato and sausage thing that came with it was absolutely delicious though! \n\nPrices are a bit steep for the quality of food you get although I guess it is a fancier place. I had the guava margarita and it didn't taste much like anything other than a regular margarita, which wasn't bad but not what I was expecting. \n\nOverall a good experience with the guacamole and random side dish as standouts. If you want mexican food and a nice night out this is a good option but if you just want good food you're probably better served elsewhere."

It's in such a beautiful little corner of Headhouse Square. \n\nI actually screwed up on the reservation and made it for the wrong day so we showed up on a Sunday without an actual reservation. However they were able to seat us at a small table in the bar area. It worked out for the best because we were able to get the happy hour specials. I had a couple margaritas and they were really fantastic. They were definitely fresh. \n\nFor an appetizer we had one of the guacamole specials that included pine nuts and cilantro. It was mouth watering. It they would have handed me a vat full of it and a spatula I would have polished it off. My only gripe about it at check time is that it cost $13, when regular tableside guac cost $8. Next time I think we'll just go with the traditional guacamole. \n\nFor dinner I had the Bistec Azteca, which was a skirt steak with avocado fries. The steak was tender and delicious, although not remarkable. The star of the show was the avocado fries. Seriously. Why have I never had this before? Why have I never made this before? The hot avocado inside the fried outside was creamy and absolutely phenomenal. Thinking of it right now is making me hungry. Truly the star of the night. \n\nMy husband had the pork tenderloin. Of the two meats I preferred his, the seasoning was strong, and I definitely recommend. \n\nFor dessert we had churros with chocolate dipping sauce. They were your traditional churros and brought us back to churros for breakfast in Mexico. \n\nXochitl is definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city."

I was SOLD when I saw that they have tamales (klinda hard to come across).\nMade a reservation for two using the open table app.\n\nThe place is a bit cramped and there is a downstairs seating area (though I didn't see it).\nWe were greeted and seated rapidly however it did take a bit of time for a server to come over and take even out drink orders.\n\nI started with the Sangria which was made with tequila.  When I make Sangria it is usually qith gin or triple sec but this was a nice change.  It was fruity and refreshing.  I went to the cervesa afterwards because I love to try new beers and they had a good selection of Mexican beer that I hadn't tried before.\n\nI believe you MUST have the guacamole when coming here.  There is a small card on the table (see pic) and you check off teh things you would like to be mixed into the guac.  So though it is not prepared table side they make it to your liking.\n\nAppetizer: shared the tuna cerviche.  This was a play on the typical cerviche I have had as well.  It was served with thin slices of tuna and seasoned with chunks of onions, tomatoes etc.  It was ok.\n\nEntree's:  Fish tacos and mushroom tamale--both were just ok\n\nThere is a bathroom nestled in the corner behind the bar.  This is directly across from the kitchen entrance.  There is literally no room between the bathroom door and the entrance and I was smacked with the kitchen door.  I was a little shocked and the girl who came out of the kitchen did not even apologize!\n\nOverall, I think I would prefer to try another Mexican place or visit one that I have enjoyed more in the past."

Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype.\n\nFirst impression was good.  The place was welcoming and had good ambiance.  We were seated quickly and the hostess was friendly.  Few minutes later hostess comes back as our waitress.  I noticed some cocktails were $9 and some were $24.  To me that either means some are sharable fishbowls or some are top shelf.  I asked the waitress what sizes the cocktails come in and she just stared at me.  So I clarified, asking in terms of ounces.  More awkward staring and she finally said she didn't know.  Ok.  No offer to walk 10 feet over to the bar and find out.  Cool.  I guess I'll be surprised when I order this Margarita... Got the perfect margarita and boyfriend got some pineapple thing.  Mine was strong but not great.  I wasn't a fan of his, but whatever.  Not my drink.  \n\nWe got the build your own guac and the red snapper ceviche as starters.  The guac was perfect.  Seriously great.  That's about it.  The ceviche was plated well and visually appealing, but that's it.  I took one bite and said \"nope\".  Boyfriend finished it because he was starving but didn't love it.  It was a bit overpriced, and tasted more like a seafood salad than a ceviche.  It really missed the light fresh flavors that are meant to come with citrus and onion and just felt heavy and overly fishy.  Not how I prefer ceviche, which is something we eat once every few weeks.  (I will point out that we didn't complain and it was gone when she collected the plates, so she likely had no idea we weren't satisfied and if you don't speak up, they can't fix it, so that's on us) \n\nI was going to order the fish tacos but learned they were out.  Was thinking about the lamb but they were out of that too.  After that I felt pressured to order so I just got a salad thinking it would be pretty hard to screw up.  Wrong again.  It looked like it would have been great if it had a different dressing and base.  The toppings (tomato, radish) were fresh and looked good but the spinach/lettuce was a bowl of wilted soggy slop.  I really wasn't a fan of the dressing; probably should have gotten it on the side.  Tried my boyfriends' spicy tacos.  Got no spice (and I'm a weenie when it comes to spices usually).  Ordered a different cocktail, something with jalepeno.  It was just ok.  Not bad but not great.  \n\nI felt like there was a lot of time where we were just sitting & waiting for her to come back.  They weren't terribly busy but I think she was the only server; didn't see anyone else. At nearly $100 for 2 of us I don't think we'll be back."

        "text": "If it weren't for restaurant week, I would have given Xochitl five stars. Alas, their restaurant week menu feels like a scam, and you don't get your money's worth. Portions are watered down half size versions of their full menu. You are better off ordering off their full menu and paying close to the same thing (sans desserts, which aren't that good anyway) and getting double the food. DON'T COME HERE FOR RESTAURANT WEEK.\n\nThat being said, their jalapeno corn puree is something I dream about. It is by far the best way I've ever had corn prepared in my life. I've been to Xochitl twice, and I tend to be a somewhat boring person in that if I find a dish I really like, I'll often go back and order the same thing. So basically, both times I've gone there, I've ordered the same thing. I guess that's why I was so incredibly disappointed by the Restaurant Week menu, as I've had the same thing off the regular menu and it was waaaaaaaay better.\n\nFor a starter, the ahi tuna ceviche was great. Perfect spice, although it could probably use a few more chips - they seemed like they were more for garnish than for actually scooping up the ceviche. Restaurant week version gave you a smaller portion with even fewer chips, and didn't seem nearly as spicy, unfortunately.\n\nEl Dorado was my main - salmon with that delicious corn puree I previously mentioned, with a tomatillo salad. If you order it regular, you get a huge portion of salmon which is stuffed with crab. The tomatillos in the salad are strangely good, the acid of the tomatillos pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the corn. The disappointing restaurant week version of the meal comes with a tiny piece of salmon, not stuffed, with the corn and a few leaves of lettuce thrown on top, with nary a tomatillo to be found. I guess you might begin to see why I was quite disappointed with Restaurant Week!\n\nAll in all, I think the food at Xochitl is great. Everyone seems friendly and the service is decent. I would just strongly advise to not order off the Restaurant Week menu, as it really appears to be not worth the money when you compare it to the dishes on the full menu, otherwise you may find yourself as disappointed as I was on my second visit."

My fianc\u00e9 ordered from the restaurant week menu and regretted it because he didn't like his appetizer or dessert so it wasn't really worth it. \n\nThe tables inside are super on top of each other.

Eventually I asked her for a regular menu not knowing if she was just an assistant that brings water, clears tables, etc. or our actual waitress. Eventually we realized she was our waitress. She was nice and got the job done but the service was nothing to rave about. \n\nWe filled out our card to customize our guacamole. It was very spicy. It was good but I've had better. A small portion for the price. Not enough chips...we had to ask for more. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the ceviche which oddly enough wasn't served with anything to dip except for two small plantain chips. He said it was fishy. \n\nI thought the restaurant week menu was supposed to be the same size portions as the regular menu but I got veggie enchiladas and he got chicken enchiladas and my dish was served with 3, his with 2. My tomatillo sauce was good but the whole dish was cold. I asked what vegetables were in my veggie enchiladas but she said she didn't know and would have to ask. I didn't feel like waiting so I told her not to worry about it. I should have waited because I never would have ordered them in a million years. It was the strangest grouping of veggies I've ever gotten in a veggie enchilada. Broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, zucchini. Ugh. Not good at all. Who puts potatoes in a veggie enchilada?!?\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 got the tres leches cake for dessert. Again...nasty. It was the strangest texture ever. It tasted like rice pudding. Horrible.

Then I fell out of the habit of dating. \n\nThen there was the overly long relationship with speed dial and Little Italy Pizza. \n\nAnyway, New Year ...\n\nLike many here I approached the new Xochitl with trepidation/shoulder chip. I just really liked what we had and wasn't ready to move on. So for those of you who like me, knew the old and are curious about the new (well, it's 6 months new), this review is for you.\n\nAtmosphere is still great.\n\nService improved vastly after the sh!tty dip earlier this year.\n\nMenu kept some of the greats from before but changed it up and got slightly less adventurous. At first blush it reads more basic (blah blah blah tacos, tamales) but the ingredients and execution keeps it all interesting.\n\nThey had the nerve to remove the queen bee item from the former menu, Tortilla Soup, BUT they talked me off the ledge when they revealed it was the night's special. I haven't tried their version, but based on how they handled the other dishes, I feel reasonably confident they'll do it well.\n\nThe red sangria got a makeover from brush-teeth drinking glass to a stem glass with a half straw with red grape halves. Still works though drinking it with the straw makes me feel so ... effete. Ole.\n\nThe guacamole (I got the regular - I can't abide by the mix-ins concept popularized by lame El Vez) was suprisingly excellent - complex flavors, good crunch, deceptively rich. The tortilla chips were very fine - thick cut.  But not stellar. I wanted them to be a little warm. Or a little lime. Or both.\n\nThe queso fundido (two versions, adobe peppers or chorizo - I did the peppers) was tasty but imperfect. It was a little greasy - sort of ridiculous complaint given molten cheese IS grease. It formed a nice cheesy crust which to me is grade A fat-girl eating. The tortillas tasted a little pre-fab, which brought the dish down a notch.\n\nThe fried chicken was a mixed bag. As someone else mentioned the menu takes pains to let you know how involved the preparation is. The final product is very good though maybe not a panty wetter. It's moist from the 40 days and nights of marinating but not necessarily flavorful. And the chili sauce lacing visual resembled the way a Bennigan's would drizzle icing on a danish. It's kind of pedestrian and a wood deflator. The accompanying corn bread was wonderful: some nice chewy corn, good rough texture while the overall effect remained moist. I wanted the bread to be warmer, but you can't have it all. The side greens with chorizo is a miss. Way too much chorizo and a little heavy on the vinegar. I live for greens but I'm not so sure about these.\n\nBut clearly I was happy with my meal & overall experience (loved the waitress - friendly, knowledgeable, not at all pushy, efficient) so I asked if they had dessert and ... they do. I got this roiling hot chocolate cake in a ramekin (not the molten style - I believe that concept has finally inched its way to restaurant heaven) but the real news here is the topping.

We came as a group of 5 and were seated at a nice, isolated table in the back of the bar. Our server pronounced all the drinks and specials as I would assume to be the correct way.  \n\nWe started with beers, the blood orange margarita (not my fav, bleh) and the Bochito margarita (hello new best friend). Though the vegetarian options were limited (one entree) the two vegetarians in the group split the order and it worked out. I can't recall exactly what my friends ordered so I'll tell you about what my veggie friend and I shared.\n\nFirst of all, gauc for the table. Just do it. 'Nuff said.\n\nFor starters: \n--Sopa Azteca - by far my favorite thing on the menu. So yummy and since we split the portion it was the perfect size. \n--Ensalada - also very good but I wanted to keep eating my sopa and not get rid of the taste in my mouth. In hindsight, I wish I had spent a little more time with the salad, I feel guilty I neglected it.\n\nEntree:\nThere was only one vegetarian entree so of course that is what we ordered. But we were not disappointed!!!! My mouth is watering thinking about the tamales. There were two different kinds - the chestnut and the huitlacoche, or 'corn fungus'. I didn't get the try the huitlacoche because we didn't realize both tamales were different until we had each devoured the one in front of us. Anyway, no complaints from the friend who did eat it.\n\nSweets:\nChurros with hot chocolate =] I don't need to elaborate.\n\nI cannot wait to come back!! Even if just for the drinks..there were so many more I wanted to try."

But unfortunately, the guacamole had its tush handed to it by the best fried tortilla chips I've stuffed my face with. Double layered and perfectly salty, these chips are fried to light gold perfection, and it's guaranteed you'll leave the basket empty...with nothing but grease remnants staining the red napkin to let you know who's been where.\n\nThe mushroom tamale dish was more like one long skinny tamale topped with dollops of soft Mexican white cheese.

Xochitl's menu is creative and deliberate, better than most places where the side dishes and appetizers are simply afterthoughts. \n\nDrinks: The Michelada is beer spiked with lime juice and chile powder. Definitely interesting - I think you'll love it or hate it. I loved it. Margarita's are decent but a tad pricey and they have an extensive tequila menu. \n\nAppetizers: Try the ceviches! The most traditional is the \"Vuelve a la Vida\" with fresh scallops, squid, pieces of fish marinated in lime juice. I thought their best one was scallops with watermelon - very thinly sliced and perfectly sweet together. Sopes and Tamales are miniature and cute, worth a try but not spectacular. \n\nEntrees: I went with 5 other people who all ordered different things. I thought all the entrees were good and filling. The shrimp dish is impressive - huge shrimp with heads left on in a very savory sauce. It was definitely the one that had the \"Wow\" factor. \n \n4.5 stars I would say. Only minus is the price and difficulty in getting a reservation."

We got margs and sangria at the bar for happy hour, and both were very much to our liking.\n\nThey have a customizable guacamole option, which we opted out of this time, but it looks really fun! We were fans of the tortilla soup and the ceviche tostadas we had to start. Our entrees were a little smaller than we had guessed, but they were quite good nonetheless. I enjoyed my shrimp tacos. They had a nice background spice that lasted throughout eating them. They were reminiscent of the shrimp tacos at El Vez (which is a good thing!).

From the moment we walked in, we just got a weird vibe - the hostess was kind of rude, the waitresses were confused as to who was serving our table (we gave our drink orders and literally 2 seconds later a different waitress was standing at our table asking what we would like to drink...confusing!).  \n\nThe restaurant in itself is cute, intimate (VERY small), and colorful.  We were seated at a back table and it was uncomfortably hot - but it wasn't hot outside, go figure.  The place was really loud, too.  \n\nWe all took advantage of the $32 guac & chips, appetizer, and entree special (El Sabor).  First of all, the guacamole is made tableside and is really, really good. I got the Ensalada app, which I thought was light, refreshing, and flavorful.  For dinner, I got the falda de res - so good. \nOther appetizers we got were:  chorizo (sausage) with kale - it was alright, and the queso fundido (don't do it), which was basically a pile of melted cheese, it was gross.  Other entrees - I don't even remember, which probably means that they weren't all that memorable (and I didn't order them).  I enjoyed my meal, but my friends were not impressed with theirs.  On the plus side - the drinks were delish!  I'm not sure that I want to go back....too pricey, not enough food, and cramped quarters!"

The service was sub-par but the food was good enough to warrant a second visit to give Xochitl another try.\n\nOur group was promptly seated by the host and quickly filled out the \"build your own guacamole\" card placed at our table. The host returned to our table a few minutes later and asked if our server had visited to take our drink order, she had not but it hadn't been that long so no big deal. He took our guacamole card and drink order, a few of us settled on El Pepinos (jalapeno infused tequila, simple syrup, lime juice and muddled basil) - yummy!\n\nAfter the host returned with our drinks he asked to take our order as our waitress had yet to check on us - we had been seated for about 15 minutes by this point. Again, not annoyed because at least someone was waiting on us, right?! As always, I asked for recommendations and let's just say his reaction to this question was a little awkward, his \"are you kidding me?!\" expression and lack of recommendations (\"everything is good\") was off-putting. Moving on...\n\nWe ordered the flatbread and empanadas for appetizers and the braised short ribs and steak for entrees. The flatbread was a little chewy, maybe because the \"crust\" was maza - which is fine, but I think it was made too far in advance as a function of restaurant week so it seized up and became hard to chew. The mushrooms and cilantro toppings were good though. Some of my friends loved the three cheese empanadas, while I thought they were a little greasy - but hey, it's fried dough stuffed with cheese so I think it's a given that the dish is going to be a little greasy. The sauce and corn salsa served with the empanadas were really good though. \n\nThe entrees were ok, not great, just OK. The flavor of both were great but the rice on the side of each plate was bland and the temperature of both dishes was luke warm at best. The desserts are not even worthy of the time it'd take me to type, but let me say this: the tres leche cake was such an odd consistentcy I am convinced it's not a cake but rather overcooked rice mushed into a cake form...yep.\n\nMy favorite go-to Mexican places will remain El Rey and Los Cabellitos...All that being said, I will give Xochitl another try because it was restaurant week and other places have been redeemed after an OK initial experience."

My guest and I arrived early and sat down for some happy hour discount margaritas that kicked butt. The bartender had been given some of the roasted grasshoppers that would be in the grasshopper taco entree and he passed these along to us. They were great, with a dusting of chipotle powder that made them taste like slightly spicy popcorn. I'd eat these any day over the crap some bars put out as a snack. \n\nWe had made reservations for 5pm the first day this menu was being offered, which just happened to correspond with St. Patrick's day, so the crowd was light. We ordered the special menu with the beverage accompaniment. \n\nFor appetizers we had the grasshopper tacos and the zucchini blossoms with air-cured beef. I know - shame on me for not getting the breaded veal brains, but my stomach was a bit off from a cold earlier in the week and I was concerned something that unique to my palate might result in a scene. \n\nThe tacos were delish, and the grasshoppers really didn't add more than a crunchiness to the taco. The air cured beef was also nice, resembling a light speck in taste. The accompanying beverage, was rum infused with honey and anise, and was wayyyyyy to sweet for me. I passed this to my guest, who enjoys sweeter drinks and gave it thumbs up. \n\nSecond course brought venison meatballs with huitlacoche sauce and tostadas with monkfish tinga. The meatballs were quite heavy, and I wished for more of the huitlacoche in the sauce as the taste was very faint. The tostadas were nicely light with good portions of monkfish. The beverage was tequila with fermented pineapple and piloncillo. Nice and not too sweet. \n\nFor the third course, we had the frog legs with butter and garlic and braised wild boar. Both dishes were perfectly prepared and tastes as expected. The frogs legs were light and sweet, and the boar rich and woodsy. Mezcal with prickly pear juice was the accompanying drink and my favorite of the lot. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the tropical fruit flan and the chocolate cake with amaranth and walnuts. The flan was the winner here, with rich taste and a surprising lightness, and both my guest and I like chocolate, so it was a surprise to both of us we liked this over the chocolate cake. The cake was good, but the flan was great. The drink was agave, mango, and coconut and again was too sweet for me. My guest liked it, though noted the agave gave it a substantial viscosity. \n\nOverall - the food was very good and the experience of trying some of these fun, off the normal menu dishes was great. I wouldn't hesitate to go back to try the regular menu."

Maybe it was all the new people I met, or all the faces I hadn't seen in a while, or exchanging a game of footsie with my friend - whatever it was, Xochitl really came alive.\n\nThe experience began by sitting at the bar (often a wise decision) under the care of Eric. He's a pro and just before you've cleared your last sip, he's at the ready with a new drink in hand or a quick recommendation. Eric is fast and efficient without being unnecessarily chummy but don't let it fool you, you'll be exchanging high fives after your 3rd or 8th drink. He also happens to be one of the most respected bartenders in Philly. \n\nNew chef Lucio Palazzo has maintained many of the old beloved dishes while adding some excellent new choices to create an accessibly smart menu. \n\nSome things you should check out:\n-La Chilindrina (blanco tequila, blood orange, lime, canela, chile)\n-Chespirito (poblano-infused blanco tequila, green chartreuse, St. Germain)\n-Cazuela de chorizo y papas (caserole of chorizo, potatoes, and kale)\n-Queso fundido\n\nRegretfully, I did more drinking than I did eating, but the little I did have definitely piqued my interest for some more.

I always chill at the bar, as Xochitl has some of the most hospitable and knowledgeable (not to mention heavy-handed) tenders in the city.  \n\nThough some truly great tequilas will set you back a bit its more than worth it.  Personally, I'm partial to the Casa Noble Anejo, a tree-bark brown delight that my friends and I describe as \"the one that smells like Grandma and tastes like Grandpa.\"  A warm butterscotch nose precedes the cherry tobacco flavors, finished with lively spearmint.  Its on this one that I really learned to appreciate sipping tequila rather than the old standby: lick, slam suck.  No limes and salt, please, just a snifter-shaped glass and a side of sangrita (the amazing spicy tomato and citrus aperitif served alongside most tequilas enjoyed neat).\n\nIts impossible to be steered wrong on the menu--everything is heavenly--but the true delight is always going to be the tequilas, whether standing by themselves, in one of the creative house cocktails or in the margarittas made with freshly squeezed limes.\n\nAs an added bonus, Xochitl is quite often a bustling hub of food industry peeps, especially on Sundays.  You're never going to find a more lively, and engaging crowd.  Staff from Zahav--those lucky bastards--are encouraged to enjoy their shift drink at Xochitl (and vice versa) but chances are you'll find restaurant people from all over the city.

The service from our hostess, to the bartenders and our waitress, was outstanding. Friendly, thoughtful, and just on \"it.\" We ordered the make your own guac (red onions, roasted garlic, jalepenos, black truffle and cilantro), the huaracho (sp?) with chorizo, the El Dorado (pan seared salmon, stuffed with lump crab, over a jalepeno cream corn and a small arugula salad) and the spicy brisket enchiladas. Everything was delicious. My salmon was slightly overdone (reason for 4 stars) but still extremely tasty. The ambience was perfect. My only big complaint was with the couple next to us talking about fecal matter next to us during dinner...but that's not on the restaurant. Defintely want to try the rest of the menu and make this place a part of our rotation."

The food itself was just okay, although we did like the make-your-own guacamole option.  If you do decide to add truffle, be aware that it will overpower the rest of the flavors!  They were also out of the marinated fish tacos tonight, and while the spicy brisket tacos were decently spicy, they were also quite small and a bit bland.  The braised boneless short rib was tender and flavorful, and came topped with a savory blend of mushrooms, corn, and onion, all served over rice.  I would recommend this, as well as the baby back ribs, although I am sure that you can get comparable quality, or better, at Percy's.  The perk here is that they were spicy.  The shrimp chile nogada was solid with a good balance of shrimp, rice, queso, and surprising addition of pomegranate seeds, but not very spicy.  The version at El Rey is definitely spicier.   The short rib tamales were probably the least favorite, as they were small, dry, and bland, despite the generous side of chili gravy.  Service was decent, but overall, the food was pricey (~$25-30/entree and $16 for tacos) for the small portions and not as flavorful as Veracruzana.  The location is great, though, and it is a fun spot for a larger group."

The restaurant wasn't very full but it was a Monday night so I imagine it's just not very busy because of that but at least we were seated pretty promptly. \n\nWe were greeted and had our drink orders placed promptly. Since the restaurant was running a \"meatless Mondays\" special, all non-pork/chicken/beef items were 15% off. I decided to have the shrimp tacos, an order of the fried yucca and a margarita. The table also decided on guacamole to share. The guacamole is \"made to order\" by using the card on the table to pick your ingredients. There are definitely some non-traditional ingredients on their like strawberries, pomegranates, and some other things. We decided to stay in the traditional lane of ingredients and we enjoyed appetizer and our waiter brought a second round of chips without being prompted which was nice.\n\nMy favorite bite of the night was the yucca fries. They were perfectly prepared and served piping hot. I'm kind of a yucca fry snob so this was really exciting for me. The shrimp tacos were okay. The toppings looked fresh and colorful and the shrimp were large but the sauce on the taco didn't quite do it for me. Overall, it was a very wet taco and the flavors of what was in it just didn't have enough dynamics in flavor and texture. Was it tasty? Sure. Would I order it again? Unfortunately, no.\n\nOverall, I would say that if you eat at this restaurant knowing it's a fusion Mexican restaurant, it's perfectly fine. If you go in expecting more traditional flavors then you might be disappointed. I was in between three and four stars for my rating but decided on four since the waiter, Ian, was really attentive and kind and brought us a flan at the end of the meal. Also, the bartender came and asked if we wanted to see anything on TV and changed the channels so we could watch the Sixers game. In addition, the restaurant had a nice romantic mood (though some might find it dark). All pluses that bumped up their overall rating. Personally, I prefer a traditional Mexican meal over fusion but I think the food was tasty regardless."

However, once we got there we realized that whatever sparked our interest on the menu wouldn't add up to $35/person so we skipped it and ordered ala carte.  For starters the guacamole made tableside was well worth the $8 - what a treat!  Too bad it was in a lava bowl or we would have licked it clean.  Dinner was good (he had the pork and I had the Enfrijoladas) but not amazing - the Enfrijoladas were lacking ... something.  If this was the kind of place that had hot sauce on the table I definitely would have indulged.  Ended up having my share of the pork.  Service was great, extremely attentive but not pushy."

I chose to sizipp on some Don Julio up, and they delivered it with some tomato/Tabasco palette cleanser thing that was essentially a spicy virgin bloody Mary. Wonderful tequila and a nice touch.\n\nA drink is one thing, but the real deal is obviously the food. We started with the Vuelva a la Vida ceviche (scallop, squid, oyster, shrimp). It was pretty darn good, presented nicely with cilantro, onion, tomato, chile, and a tomato type sauce. Next up, I had the mixed grill, which was good, but nothing earth-shattering -- as my wife put it, \"glorified fajitas\". Again, not to say that it wasn't good, but really nothing great special for the price (most expensive on the menu). My wife had the enfrijoladas, which were disappointing tortilla wrapped veggies, with barely any veggies inside. Finished everything with the churros which as others mentioned, are radical.\n\nWe were both kind of underwhelmed, but I'd go back to visit Don Julio again."

All the courses were super  bland. The tortilla soup tasted like dish water and my chicken course as well as all of our entrees were so piled high with cilantro to compensate for the lack of flavoring  we barley finished our meals. If cilantro is the chefs idea of \"authentic\" mexican flavoring I would probably go back to the basics of plain old salt and pepper!. The desserts were equally disappointing. The server even told us to stay away from the flan!!  Service was good but Ive had much much better. We all left highly disappointed and I do not recommend this place during Restaurant Week."

The cazuela was delicious as well--the kale complemented the chorizo very nicely. \n\nEntrees: I got the costillas de puerco, baby back ribs in a mole sauce served with pickled veggies and refried beans. She got the arroz con pollo frito, which was two pieces of chicken battered in a tortilla chip crust served over rice and veggies with two sauces. Like KFC with less of a hit on your self esteem after finishing it. Both dishes were awesome. Healthy portions which is always nice. \n\nCocktail menu had a nice selection of unique tequila niceties.

I made a reservation on opentable and was excited because it was a 1000 point time, which is awesome! When we arrived our waiter seated us and handed us menus and explained the create your own guacamole thing they have. I told him we had a livingsocial voucher, he stopped in his tracks and ran off to go find the prix fixe menus. He didn't return. He was replaced with another waiter (possibly the manager?) who explained that our opentable reservation had to be canceled because we couldn't have a voucher and receive points for our reservation. It doesn't say that anywhere on the voucher or on opentable that I can find, but ok. \n\nWe each ordered a margarita one perfect and one rosa for $13 each. They were both really tasty, but after you got through all the ice, it was about 2 oz of liquid. Definitely not worth the $13. The guacamole was good and so was the mushroom flatbread. The ceviche was nothing special. It was bland aside from the peppers and needed more citrus. The entrees we got were the fried chicken and the short rib. The chicken and the cornbread it came with were really good, but the salad that came with it was so spicy that neither of us could eat it. I love spicy food, but this was just not worth fighting through the pain. The short rib was a little dry, but the sides that came with it (rice and a pepper and onion stir fry) and the sauce it was in was very good. The deserts were not good. We got the flan and the chocolate cake. Both were a weird texture, the flan was more thick and gelatinous than I've ever had flan and the chocolate cake was a wet mush that looked like ground beef with whipped cream on top. \n\nWhen we received our check, our waiter informed us of what the price of the meal would have been without the voucher and what the actual price was. I buy groupons and vouchers often and I'm always sure to tip on the actual amount, not what I paid for the voucher, so I was put off by having it pointed out as if to say this is what you should tip me on. If I need to know what the actual cost of the dinner was, I will ask you. \n\nI won't coming back here. The service was rude and the prices were way to high for what this restaurant is. If I want pricey Mexican I'll go to El Vez and get a decently portioned margarita for $13."

I have been here before for happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed the offerings then. Tonight's food surpassed my previous experience. \n\nThe guacamole was truly the star of the dinner. They allow you to customize your guacamole so we added red onion, roasted tomatoes, and chipotle. The ratio of guacamole to chips was perfect--neither was left in excess. I mentioned to my husband that if I could replace another course with an additional guacamole course I would do it. \n\nI ordered the posole soup for the second course and the spice level was just right, with tender pieces of meat. My husband had the ceviche and enjoyed it as well.\n\nFor the third course I ordered the seafood enchiladas and they came with a side salad. It was light and creamy and delicious. My husband said he would order it again despite not being an enchilada fan generally. He said the difference was the cream-based sauce as opposed to the usual salsa verde sauce. \n\nFinally, we ordered one of each of the two dessert options. The flan was light and had a lovely texture and mouth feel. The tres leches cake was rich and sweet. The latter filled us right up, but they were both perfect with the coffee served in a French press. The coffee was extra, but it was a lovely complement. \n\nThank you for the wonderful night, Xochitle!"

Everything was great except the lack of flavor in almost everything I tasted. \nThe signature guacamole in theory was awesome. It features unique ingredients like pineapple, pomegranate seeds, etc. Yet managed to be completely void of flavor. My boyfriend thought it was hummus. I don't understand how this had no taste unless they don't use fresh ingredients. I don't understand. \nMy favorite thing I tried was queso fundido with chorizo. That was on point and I loved how it was served with tortillas. \nFor dinner I got a chicken tinga burrito which again had very little flavor. It was just completely uninspired. In my estimation mexican food should be super flavorful but this was not the case at all. \nWe tried the churros for dessert and they were the only churros I've ever tried that didn't have cinnamon or sugar on them. Just greasy dough. Which isn't terrible but wasn't what I was expecting. \nI would come here again and just get drinks because their drinks were great. I sampled the blood orange margaritas and Mexican hot chocolate both of which were great. While the food here doesn't do it for me there's enough redeeming qualities to possibly bring me back for a drink."

The margaritas are the best and I do believe they are a bit larger than they used to be. But several staff changes (including the chef) over the past year lead me to this review update. \n\nI'm going to shoot straight: this new version of Xochitl is overpriced. Not for the drinks, which I feel are worth their tag, but for the food, which is sadly not as good as it was in the past. Wanting to share a few small plates for dinner on Saturday night, we ordered a red snapper ceviche for $14. The fish was more like sashimi with some red onion and orange pieces thrown in. There was absolutely no citrus taste to the fish itself, which is a staple in ceviche. It really lacked any kind of taste other than the snapper, which could have used a little salt as well. \n\nTwo types of tacos were better in show. The steak tacos were juicy and very flavorful, and the chicken tacos with a nice, healthy slice of avocado were great... with the exception of a small bone in one of mine. The accompanying sides of black beans were slightly warmer than room temp and not so great. \n\nThese three plates plus two margaritas each came close to $100, including a generous tip (we received a couple new drinks on the house in exchange for our thoughts on them so we wanted to make sure our server Michelle was covered). Happy hour will probably be the way to go for me in the future, because I cannot live without those amazing margs. Sadly, the late night happy hour I used to love on Thursday nights is no longer, but I'll happily pull up a seat from 5-7 on weekdays."

Full disclosure: My second visit was comped because my boyfriend and I were invited to come in and sample the menu. But our first visit was on us, and we arrived on the very first Sunday they started offering the brunch menu.\n\nStarting with the drinks, the coffee has an ever so slight cinnamon taste that really goes well with the bold flavors of the food. Mimosas are served cold and taste fresh-squeezed. Bloody Marias are a bold take on traditional BMs, served with tequila and a chili-salt rim. Waters are filled regularly without having to make requests. \n\nXochitl's ceviche remains one of my favorite preparations in the city. So light, so flavorful, no matter what variation they are serving it is always delicious. Skip the usual guacamole and share this light starter instead.\n\nOn both visits the boy and I ordered the same exact thing. For him, huevos con chorizo: Two sunny-side eggs baked in a dish with kale, potatoes and loads of chorizo. Just as good as it sounds. For me, huevos revueltos: Eggs scrambled with thick-cut, almost pancetta-like bacon pieces and spicy peppers, topped with queso fresco and spicy salsa and served with corn tortillas. Every bit as good with egg whites substituted for whole eggs, which I requested on my second visit. \n\nWe also tried the cornmeal and black bean pancakes, topped with fresh whipped cream, seasonal berries and the most delicious syrup I've ever had the pleasure of eating.

The Perfect Margarita that the waiter suggested was strong and tasty.

My water glass was never empty.  He even spent a little time chatting with us about our evening, seeming to be genuinely interested in how we were spending the rest of it.  Quite pleasant and he made us feel comfortable and at home among the crowd.\n\nWe will definitely be back, this time with friends!"

We had all taken trains into the city and we're having a fun day out. The waitresses served myself and the other male but for some reason refused to serve the female. When I said that my friend would like a drink the waitresses asked us where we came from. I told her we had just come from spruce street harbor park. The waitress and her attitude were condescending and not at all appropriate and she should be fired. My friend was extremely upset and outraged and walked away from the outdoor table we were seated at. Thankfully a manager or someone claiming to be management came and I explained the situation and told him I was willing to pay for the amazing tacos but they would have to take the alcohol off the bill because our night was now ruined. My friend was extremely upset and it troubled her for the remainder of the night. The waitress had no right to be that condesending to my friend. We were not rude, obnoxious or belligerent. We did indeed start being rude once the waitress made the comment asking us where we came from and would not serve my friend. I ate the remaining tacos while my friend felt embarrassed and cried. I paid for the tacos and left a zero tip. In all honesty now reflecting on the situation and how upset it made my friend for the remainder of the night I would like my full money back. I did not know when I paid for the tacos how much this situation would ruin the night. I felt we were incorrectly treated like children. I am a CPA, the other male a Ph.d and the female has a masters in economics and financial planning. We are all in our Thirities. It was truly amazing how much we were disrespected.\n\nThanks You."

Three words= Crackling, pork, rinds!! Sounds horrific, but let me tell you- if you ever thought about, intrigued to try them, THIS is the place to do it. They are accompanied with a radish, mint salsa verde and it's complete unhealth yumminess on your lips, but totally worth it! Wash it down with a margarita or shake it up with some tequila flights!! The guacamole was also delicious and compliments any drink on the menu.\n\nI can't speak to the rest of the menu, but the tasty tidbits that we did have were muy delicioso:)"

Xochitl has made me a believer again.  My friend and I arrived slightly early for our 7 p.m. resie but we were escorted to a table immediately.  Our water glasses were filled and bread was dropped off with two buttery spreads.\n\nOur server, whose name escapes me, was wonderful throughout the experience.  When she asked to take our drink order and I handed over the recipe for a \"Skinnygirl Margarita,\" she didn't bat an eye although she did let me know that their regular margaritas are made only with tequila, fresh lime juice and a little bit of simple syrup.  No sour mix, no triple sec, no hidden agendas; just honest ingredients, served over ice, with a rim of salt.  I ended up taking her word for it.  (For the record, one Skinnygirl plus two positively delicious Xochitl margs equals three sheets to the wind, minus any trace of a stomachache, which I almost always get when I drink margaritas anywhere else.  Hallelujah!)  \n\nThe food was glorious.  For our first course, we both chose the tortilla soup.  Large bowls containing cubes of cheese, slices of avocado, tortilla strips and dried peppers were presented to both of us.  The broth was poured on top, tableside.  I really enjoyed this dish, although my friend and I agreed that the dried peppers had a curious taste.  She didn't like them, I was intrigued by them.  Next, we both ordered the octopus, mackerel and shrimp ceviche trio.  Each was served atop a little fried tortilla round.  I have been daydreaming about the octopus ceviche since I awoke this morning.  It was easily the most tender, well flavored octopus I have had (sorry, Mr. Garces).\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I chose the squid hot pot, which was another win.  When the lid was removed from the pot, tender rings of squid in a spicy tomato sauce appeared before us.  I have to say, the dramatic presentations really made the dining experience special.  The woman seated next to me ordered a stuffed pepper that was so beautiful it could have easily been pictured in a food magazine.  Meanwhile, at our table, my friend had food envy as she was experiencing mixed feelings about her skirt steak (which I thought was good, although it was served lukewarm).  \n\nFor dessert, my friend had the churros, which came with three dipping sauces.  One of my favorite things in life is the right to choose several condiments to go with a meal and this presentation was right up my alley.  Fortunately, I had my own dessert to tackle; an appropriately sized mini chocolate souffl\u00e9 with a mini scoop of cajeta ice cream alongside.  Perfection.\n\nOur experience last night wasn't just great by Restaurant Week standards; it was great by any night's standards.  What a truly fantastic meal.  When our bill was dropped, along with a plate of mini biscotti (delish, by the way), we were also each given a $10 card to use any time before November 31.  My dining companion and I are already discussing what we will order on our return visit!"

We waited well over an hour for entr\u00e9es which arrived cold, greasy, and the tacos fell apart -- they were dry and  soggy at the same time. There were apologies from the waitress and from the chef who was also delivering the food to the tables. Clearly understaffed, and I feel badly for them but still, it was terrible! I'm hoping for them this was just an off night, but I will not be returning."

Friendly, helpful service, and the cookies that came with the bill were an unexpected treat.  I love when I think I'm finished eating and out comes more food!  The $10 coupon for a return visit is a smart business plan... it encourages ppl to come back, and they'll certainly spend more than $10 when they do.\n\nDefinitely worth my $35 and Wed. night!"

Beers aren't plentiful, but they have enough quality non-macros to be passable. \n\nMy experience with the staff has always been exceptional. As I said, the bar tenders are friendly and interesting.

Xochital was very accommodating and I was able to be seated with no wait time. \n\nI was seated in their downstairs area, which reminded me of a speakeasy and was very intimate. I ordered the guacamole, which was hands down the best Guacamole I've had in Philly!  When you order the Guacamole, you have the chance to customize the ingredients to your liking, which was a HUGE plus for me!  Along with the Guacamole, I had their spicy margarita and shrimp tacos. The spicy margarita is a must for those who like their marg with smokey hints. And the shrimp tacos topped off the meal! Overall, this was definitely one of my best experiences with Mexican cuisine in Philadelphia. I'm still dreaming of the Guac and will definitely visit again soon!"

The portions seem small for the price, but the drinks are very good.  \n\nI give it three stars because it's not a place I'd avoid, but certainly not one I'd choose to return.

They had 4 special margaritas (pumpkin, ginger, prickly pear and pineapple/basil) I stuck with the basil ones the whole night and my boyfriend tried each of the other specials (his favorite was ginger). I could drink that pineapple basil one like it was water all day every day yum!\nWe started with the chorizo queso which was PHENOMENAL. 10/10 would order again. Came out super hot, perfectly meaty pull-able cheese. We struggled for a bit whether or not we were going to grab dinner from here or just stick with the app and drinks. So glad we stayed because it gave me a chance to try the ever so popular birra tacos and him to try all the different special margs. I ordered the enchiladas suizas which were also great. But definitely will order the birra tacos next time and he can order something else. \nI was incredibly impressed overall, the bar was clean, music wasn't too loud, AND they had the eagles game on. \nWhen we finally decided to leave and call it a night we agreed we'd be back weekly.

We were in this place for over 2 hours! And we weren't the only ones that felt the drag. The table next to us joked about the staff taking siestas between serving their courses.\n\nBut the staff was friendly enough. The constant apologies let us know that they were well aware of everything taking way longer than it should. But usually, at a well-managed establishment, once you hit the hour and half to two hour mark, someone stops by the table and offers to take a drink or appetizer off of your tab.\n\nYeah, this didn't happen.\n\nAnd now we get to the food...\n\nFIRST COURSE\nMy date's tortilla soup appetizer was actually kind of delicious. My salad appetizer...not so much.\n\nSECOND COURSE\nMy date's camarones (shrimp) dish was okay. My sopacitos was pretty good.\n\nTHIRD COURSE\nMy date's steak & chorizo tacos were super-dry, but the crispy onions gave them an interesting, flavorful crunch. My seafood enchiladas were pretty decent.\n \nSo, the food was okay -- nothing to write home about, but nothing terrible...until the desserts came out...\n\nFOURTH COURSE\nMy date's flan was okay, but a bit too creamy for flan, like the custard hadn't properly set. But my chocolate tres leches cake was an ABOMINATION! It literally tasted like ground dog biscuits soaked in chocolate milk! Not even kidding! Who let this DISGUSTING dessert out of the kitchen?!?! When I sent it back, our server wasn't surprised in the least bit, mentioning something about \"the texture.\" Yes, I've had tres leches cake before and know that it's basically milk-soaked cake, but the crumb of this cake wasn't even like cake (see \"ground dog biscuits\" comment above)! So yeah, the texture, the flavor, and everything else -- everything about this dessert was completely off! Guys, do yourselves a solid and take this off the menu tonight!\n\nAnd here's the kicker...when the server returned with the second flan to replace the tres leches abomination, it was totally different in texture from the first one that my date received. In fact, my flan was the exact opposite of hers: dense, chunky, and obviously somewhat overcooked. So much for consistency!\n\nI might have given this place 3 stars if I wasn't in there from 8:30 to 11:00 trying to get a meal, but so much for that, too.

It sounds like way too much but holy crap is was amazing. If our meal ended right here, I would give this place 4 stars for sure. Sadly, it did not. \n\nThe short rib tamale was delicious but barely resembled a tamale. The pork carnitas tacos were a bit dry and pale in comparison to my favorite ones at Cantina and the Pollo Fritta was just awful. I swear I can still feel that flavorless dry fried chicken sitting in my stomach 16 hours later.

I realize he was just trying to make it to our liking, but I'd rather have someone confident of the way its supposed to be made. We ordered a queso dip, pretty good. The ceviche is excellent! I remember last time I was there (a year ago) that there was more variety of ceviche. But the mackerel one we had was great. As were the two Sangria's I had. \n\nBut entrees were just so-so. The brisket was excellent as was the celery root puree. But it was spicy-- in a more burning way, than a flavorful way. There wasn't much variety on the entree menu. My boyfriend ordered the head-on shrimp, which when removed were just small cocktail shrimp. It also consisted of the same ingredients in his appetizer. Partly his fault, but not much variety of flavors in their dishes.
