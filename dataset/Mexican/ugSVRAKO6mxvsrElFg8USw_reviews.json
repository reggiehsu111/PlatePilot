I felt like my mama had made me a great big wonderful dinner. \nAnd we got to try cactus! The only other time the three of us that had cactus was when we had cactus martinis in the Grand Canyon.

We were looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant with good food... which from our experience comes from the small \"hole in the wall\" places. We were surprised that the yelp reviews  were so consistently high for Maribel's. We had narrowed our options down to Maribel's and one other restaurant but the Yelp ratings convinced us to go with Maribel's. I am sooo beyond happy we did because let's  just say that this is BEST Mexican food we have  ever had in the U.S... and I have had my fair share of Mexican food all over the place including in NY. \nLike the other review said- Do NOT judge this place just by its surroundings. If you do, you are only depriving yourself. It's a very clean and cute place inside. Everyone is super friendly and attentive. We ordered the guacamole which was delicious as were the chips. I ordered the Chicken Tinga Tostadas which were absolutely delicious. They were packed with sooo much flavor and had a nice kick to it (spice wise). My BF ordered the pork and chicken tacos and he absolutely loved them. My only \"complaint\" which really isn't legit is that I wish the portion of guacamole was a little larger. \nJust as an FYI for future diners- It is a BYOB restaurant- they gave plastic disposable cups (which was totally fine for us). There is no parking lot, but we had no issue finding street parking. As I said, I'm not from the area so to me the neighborhood seemed a little rough but I had no issues nor did I feel scared or uncomfortable walking around. \nThis is definitely a hidden gem and I will most definitely be making a trip back to Philly to eat here again!"

Initially I was a little skeptical because it was about 8pm, there was only 1 other person in there eating, and they told me my order of 3 orders of tacos and guac was going to take 25 minutes (it did not look like they were busy at all, so I was definitely surprised by the wait time)\n\nWell as it turns out...it was well worth the wait! This place was awesome. We got an order of Tacos al Pastor, Shrimp tacos, chorizo tacos and Guacamole w/ chips. Yes, might be a hole in the wall, but wow, the flavor in those tacos was outstanding. Overall, I would definitely come back. See below for the individual food reviews below:\n\nShrimp tacos 5/5: These were my favorite item of the order. The shrimp were charred perfectly on the grill. They came with some sort of awesome sauce that really gave a nice POP of flavor to it and even came with a slice of avocado on top. \n\nAl Pastor Tacos 4/5: Again, a great char on the pork. It was topped with onion and cilantro and just tasted awesome. The only feedback I have is that I wish it had some more pineapple on it. The piece it had was SO small and barely even noticed it.\n\nChorizo Tacos 3/5: Not as flavorful as the other tacos, but still pretty good. There was a good amount of meat on each taco so that was a plus\n\nGuac 4/5: This was pretty good. It definitely taste fresh (it was green, which is always better than brown!) and had a ton of lime and cilantro in it. \n\nPrice 3/5: Our 3 sets of tacos (3 tacos per order) and Guac + chips came to about $35, which is about average. I pretty much expect to pay $3 per taco nowadays.\n\nSauces 3/5 : They gave a green sauce + red sauce + limes with each order of tacos. The green sauce was my favorite of the two, because it was spicy but not too spicy. Hard to wrong with limes ago."

It's hard to find good Mexican food in Philly, but I was pleasantly surprised at this place. \n\nThe focus is on Mexico City style food. The menu is quite limited, but we were really happy with what we got. As others have mentioned, the star of the show are the quesadillas. It's not like what you think of when you think of a quesadilla. I would never normally go out and order that because it's something you can make easily in five minutes. However, this one was different. It is a fried crispy dough with filling in the far inside (we got cheese and mushroom) and topped with queso fresco and lettuce. It's all about the texture of the dough and it's not something I could easily make at home. The portion is also incredibly generous. You get two per order. They're probably terrible for you since they seem to be fried, but hey we all got to live a little. \n\nThe chicken tostadas were also tasty. The chicken was tender and well marinaded. The enchiladas were just okay, so I will order something else next time instead of them. Free fresh chips and salsa were brought to the table. They kindly offered to refill our salsa later so we could enjoy it with our dishes. It was nice and smokey with a little heat to it. \n\nService is friendly. I love the open kitchen. To enjoy your meal in comfort, I wouldn't go on a day with a strong temperature extreme. We went on a cold evening and it was really chilly inside. It appears they only have one little old heating/air unit."

So disappointed! Will not return!"

        "text": "Maribel has changed their name, but the delicious flavor and friendly service have stayed the same. I find myself returning here often for their Mexico City style quesadillas. If you have never had this, or even if you have, it's a must order! It's a homemade crispy masa dough that is fried and stuffed with Oaxaca cheese, a protein of your choice or mushrooms, lettuce, cream, and a little queso fresco on top. Then I add some of their homemade green and red salsa for a little heat. The ingredients come together in perfect harmony, but the crispy texture of the shell is what really makes it. \n\nWhen I first started ordering them, I got mushrooms because I would share a chicken dish with my husband too, so I wanted to change things up. Recently, I've been going because of my quesadilla craving and ordering them on my own. The first time I did this, I ordered chicken. It was pretty tasty grilled chicken, but I preferred the mushrooms. The second time I ordered it as tinga de pollo and ended up with the delicious well seasoned shredded chicken that is in their tostadas that I love so much. So please make sure you specify which one you're after when you order! \n\nI also found out that they can make this dish grilled as well. I am always tempted to try it, but the super crispy fried corn dough is always calling my name. If someone gets around to trying it, please let me know. I am just too addicted to the original at the moment!"

The service was great and the food even better! \n\nI had the enchiladas en salsa roja and it was very spicy, but delicious. When I ordered it the server said, \"are you sure? It's very hot\", so I was a little nervous but it was great. Came with a side of rice and beans too. Delicious!\n\nCash only but has an ATM inside with a $2 fee."

She went with her default of tacos a la carte, and I tried the carnitas burrito. The tacos were piled high with meat, but the burrito was lacking. The flavors were great, but the size and content of the burrito was a bit of a letdown. This place is definitely not the worst option, but there are plenty of better ones nearby."

Keep in mind that this restaurant is not related to Mi Pueblito truck that makes awesome birria tacos.\n\nI was greeted by super friendly lady, very welcoming. \n\nBirria tacos: the broth was salty, not too much flavor. I would rather wait an hour outside for the truck.\n\nAl pastor: small pieces of pork, missing the pineapple pieces, not too much flavor. It's a little bit salty for my taste."

I first have to say that I lucked up and got a parking spot right in front of the place because trust me parking around this area is tight and there are tow signs literally every where so know before you go.\n\nThe restaurant is very small. You can eat in but there are only five or six tables. The gentleman who took my order was very nice.\n\nOn to the tacos. I was hoping for greatness but I just got okay. Like with Chiquita's Pizzeria and Mexican Grill, Mexico Lindo also puts sauteed onions in with the pork. I simply don't understand why you need cooked onions when you are going to garnish it with raw onions. Maybe it's a Mexican South Philly thing. In any event I took them out. There was plenty of pineapple included which I loved. There was no grilled jalapeno or radish on the side and the limes had definitely seen better days. The salsas were thin and watery but the green one had good flavor. The taste of the Pastor was acceptable but clearly my search must go on. Other than that, I would try other menu items."

        "text": "Most authentic tacos I've had in Philadelphia! Steps away from Bok Bar so it's great for some post beer eats. Other than that, it is quite far away. Owner and waitresses mostly spoke Spanish so ordering was a bit difficult, though their menu is very self explanatory. My friend had the vegetarian burrito ($9) and I got chicken and pork tacos ($6). Meat was tender, well seasoned, and the portion size was perfect. \n\nThey are CASH ONLY. There is an ATM but at the moment, neither me nor my friend had cash/debit card and we found this out after we had devoured the food (oops). The owner was way more understanding than expected and I promised to pay him with cash the next morning. We somewhat shoke on that contract and left. Without paying. Yup. They were super chill and trusting like that. Can't get any more mom and pop shop feel than that \n\nAnyways, irrelevant to the review but FYI I did bike back a good 30 mins the next day from West Philly and delivered my dues in cash. The owner was surprised I had actually kept up my promise since he looked shocked and thanked me profusely for paying.\n\nThanks for a great home cooked meal, Maribel! (Now Mexico Lindo)"

I wanted to go and give it my fair try and chance for a good review! And they certainly didn't disappoint!\n\nAmbience- wise, it is adorable in there! And the bathroom is very clean! The staff was super friendly! But the place was empty. I went at 7 PM on a Thursday night. One or two Hispanic man came in, and so did a family of seven, but then they left when they saw that the place was on the lighter side that night.\n\nMy date and I wanted to stay and enjoy ourselves! And we certainly did! We brought in wine, and they gave us wine glasses. I ordered the chicken and steak mixed fajitas, and my date ordered Enchiladas. \n\nThe portion sizes were great, and the temperature was even better! The chicken was a little bit salty but tasted delicious mixed with the sweet peppers and onions that were cooked to perfection. Next time, I will ask for more tortillas! \nMy date liked the enchiladas! Only comment was that the chicken might be on the dry side. Salsa Verde was a sauce of choice! They also serve as complementary chips and salsa! One was spicier than the other so it complemented my date and my taste buds very well!\n\nOverall, I will definitely go back here for Mexican food! Next I will try the tacos, but I'm sure they will be superb! \n\n$24 for a lovely date night!\n\n\nThanks M\u00e9xico Lindo!"
