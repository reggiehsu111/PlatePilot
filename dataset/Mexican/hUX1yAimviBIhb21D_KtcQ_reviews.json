After a few drinks, I ordered the pulled pork tacos and my friend had a burrito. Not bad, not stellar. Just a standard very place to drink and eat Mexican food. It's got a very college feel even in the middle of the day, so keep that in mind if that's not your thing."

The special place Cactus holds in my heart is for one thing: Margarita Mondays.\n\nI walked in to Cactus this Monday with a friend from work, and the bartender had a pitcher of 'ritas going before we even sat down. Point to Cactus: The staff is on top of stuff for their regular customers.\n\nThe service can be a little slow at times, but once we get a table full of margarita pitchers life is beautiful. The 'ritas themselves aren't the most consistent (this week's were a little heavy on the juice) but for $10 I'm not complaining. And, to reply to one of the posts, they definitely don't skimp on the tequila. In fact, the bartender measures out the liquor for ever pitcher. Margaritas are pretty sweet so you can't taste it too much, and I'm sure it isn't quite as much as you'd get in a non-special, but believe me it's there.\n\nMy most serious gripe, actually, is the music. Don't know who puts the mixes on, but I protest. They actually played 'Closing Time' the other night - at 10:00, when people were still coming in. Way to send the wrong message.\n\nIt's not the best place around by any stretch, but if you ever need to unwind after a long Monday, you'll find me at Cactus."

All of the waitstaff were standing around the back of the restaurant looking at us awkwardly.  Eventually the bartender greeted us from behind the bar and pointed to the table where we will be seated.  I ordered \"The Cactus\" margarita, and it was salt lime juice and water.  Not a drop of tequila in it.  I'll give it to them that the salsa was good because of the added chipotle.  However, they have the audacity to charge $4 for an extra basket of stale chips.  Our food came out reasonably quick. My fianc\u00e9 ordered the chicken fajitas and I ordered the 5-Alarm burrito.  Mine was dry as a bone, bland, and not spicey at all.  I'm reasonably sure that they got a frozen burrito from wava and heated it under a panini press.  My fianc\u00e9e chicken was also dry and just over all bland.  Then came the waiting. We asked our waitress for the check and then she disappeared for 20 minutes.  I asked her again as she passed by our table, and still had to wait another 10 minutes.\n\nIt's a different story if they were the only show in town, but this is Main Street manayunk.  There is no reason for places like this to be taking up space if this is the quality and service they are offering."

The restaurant itself is very difficult when it comes to customizing orders (for example they have shredded chicken for burritos but can't put the shredded chicken in a quesadilla). I don't think they realize it's literally the same thing just in a different form. \n\nThe wait staff was over bearing in my opinion. Our waitress kept butting into Over conversation when she came by with remarks like \"did I just hear you say you don't like corn?\" Im all about being friendly but \"was I talking to you?\" Made us help her clean the table bc she had another party coming in very soon.

I know it was a \"deal\" but it was so bad that I couldn't even finish it. It's pretty hard to mess up a regular margarita but out of the four of us NONE of us liked our margaritas.

While I did enjoy the music I was first informed they were out of mint so I could not order a mojito, mind you this was around  6:30pm on a Friday night. What kind of Mexican establishment doesn't stay stocked with fresh mint, especially on one of the biggest drinking days of the week. I sadly had to settle for another cocktail. I then proceeded to order the chicken tacos which were a huge disappointment from looking at other dishes served. It was literally dry chicken, rice and cheese.

I went there with a few friends for a quick bite, and they screwed up 4 out of 5 orders. Not to mention having to ask for the complementary chips, silverware, and side dishes about 10 times. Also, they brought all of our food out at separate times. The first person got his dish 15 minutes before the second. It was just mind boggling that this place is owned by The Bayou, which is one of my favorite stops in Manayunk. Bottom line is, if your going to spend your money for someone else to make you food, spend it elsewhere."

Some other girls at another table had the same problem. I thought perhaps it was a new chef or something but now seeing all these bad reviews, I'm not so sure. \n\nSecondly, they have this advertised deal on the board and the waiter told us all about 25\u00a2 wings... The wings were ok, nothing special. But, here is the problem and we learned a lesson as we don't really look at bills for accuracy all the time. We had already had our card swiped and then I looked at the bill and thought it was pretty high for what we got. I saw that they had charged us 8.95 for the wings! I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt that it was a simple mistake but something tells me this probably happens a lot. I'm glad I noticed. \n\nIt was nice to be able to sit out on the sidewalk and they will probably still thrive with all the drunk idiots that frequent this area at night."

Now, not all of us are 21, and none of us even were planning on drinking at all. Maybe this is standard for manyunk or something since it's a bit of a party area, but i've never had this happen to me anywhere. It was awkward and seemed like they didn't want us there( the place was basically empty at this time, btw). This kind of made me want to leave but I was hungry and like I said the place wasn't busy. Now, i'm not normally that crazy about Mexican, mainly because i'm a somewhat picky eater, but i'm trying to be more adventurous. We explained that we just wanted something to eat and they dropped it and seated us. We were given chips & salsa to start which were pretty good. They have different specials on different days of the week and the day we went was something like $6 quesadillas. So, I figured I'd try that. The quesadilla was probably the best I ever had! It was great and really flavorful. Our waitress was fine, not memorably great or bad. Not sure if I would come back here just to eat because of the awkward seating thing, but like I said the food was very good."

Although at $3.50 a pop (it was 1/2 price sangria day) it worked for me. They had bottles of Negre Modelo (one of my fave beers with Mexican food) which was awesome. \n\nMy husband had the pulled pork enchiladas which were yummy. Not awesome, but definitely good, especially with the beer. I had the chicken salad which was ok. The flavors were overpowered by the onion and I couldn't really get a sense of the chicken salad. Chips were good, salsa was kind of bland. Great addition to the neighborhood and great place to grab a drink (skip the sangria). Ok for food."

My only minor gripe was the way the lettuce, sour cream, etc came out all on one plate. It made putting the fajita together a little tougher if there was something on there you didn't want.\n\nBut the real gem, crazy as it seems, are the firecrackers. See, I love poppers. They're spicy, fried and filled with cheese which basically makes them meet three of my four major food groups (the other being chocolate, of course). But the firecrackers aren't the wimpy frozen things you get at any pizza place in town. Oh no, these are huge singe-your-mouth peppers filled with a wonderfully melty gooey blend of cheeses and fried to crisp perfection. They're messy, certainly unhealthy and burn even my mouth a bit, but they are by far the best cheese-filled pepper concoction I've found.\n\nFirecrackers = worth a whole new star.\n\n(Was tempted to write about the firecrackers without giving an extra star, though, just to reflect the irritation I feel with their frequent and lousy guest bartenders.

The chorizo was dry, the eggs tasted like a mix, and the cheese wasn't even melted.

For food, I ordered the Chorizo Pub Burger, which was outstanding. The chorizo patty was nice and crispy on the outside, with a nice juicy center. Our server was also very sweet and attentive. My only issue with this place was the bartender that was working. The ratio of margarita mix to tequila was very inconsistent, with a taste equivalent to overly sweetened lemonade with barely any alcohol. When we kindly requested the bartender add an additional shot (we even stated we were willing to pay extra if we had to), he gave us a sour attitude about it and proceeded to talk about us to his coworker. To me, that just shows poor customer service skills. Word of advice: if you're going to complain about customers, do it out of earshot next time. If there's a different bartender next time around, I might feel inclined to return because the food was decent."

The waiter said he had to make a pot which I should have taken as a bad sign. I guess its my fault for still ordering it and at a Mexican restaurant. Once I finally got it it pretty much tasted like tar even with excessive amounts of splenda and cream. So on to breakfast. I ordered the breakfast burrito which the waiter said was the best thing on the menu. It tasted like rotten eggs. There was no salsa or any other condiments to cover up the awful taste It's basically fake mexican and you should just drive a bit further to Northern Liberties and go to Dos Segundos if you want good mexican cuisine!"

The service, food, and management leave a lot to be desired.\n\nIn over two hours of sitting at our table, I was able to obtain exactly two beers. It took over ten minutes for our server to tell me that they were out of the first beer I ordered. After waiting over fifteen minutes for him to return with the second bottled beer I ordered, he asked me if I wanted another of my first beer because he forgot I had already asked for something different. After that, I waited another fifteen minutes for it, ten of which the beer was sitting on the end of the bar perhaps fifteen feet away. I probably would have tried five or six of their premium beers. Everyone else at the table had similar problems, and we never seemed to get any water.\n\nI am rarely displeased with Mexican food, but the quesadillas were the worst I've ever had. The garlic mashed potatoes and citrus chicken tasted the same somehow. The staff bringing things out from the kitchen had no idea which table's food they were carrying. We were constantly asked if we ordered whatever they happened to be carrying, and an enchilada meant for someone in my party ended up going to someone at the table next to us (who immediately started eating it). After waiting for another enchilada to be made, it came out covered in sour cream, when my friend had specifically asked for none. Even though he hates sour cream, he ate around it rather than waiting for a third attempt.\n\nWhen the bill came, I found that I was charged for the beer they were out of as well as the two I actually had. When I brought it to the server's attention he seemed to know exactly what I was going to say, which was at the least very sketchy. It took quite a long time to get it removed from the check, which our server told us the manager had to approve. The manager was sitting behind the bar on his phone, drinking a beer. He never came over to address any of the issues we had. Somehow a casual dinner ended up taking nearly two and a half hours, and the next time I'm in Manayunk I'll be headed elsewhere."

Thankfully (and why I am giving five stars), they basically strayed open for us. We asked when we came in, how long they'd be open. They said another 30 minutes or so, but when 30 minutes came, we started to get ready to go and the main bar tender told us we could stick around and order more drinks if we didn't mind them packing up some of the stuff around. We were really grateful since nothing else that was still open appealed to us. We ended up staying until 2:00 when, by law, they had to stop serving.\n\nWe chatted a bunch with the bar tender and he was great.

And there was only a pinch of pico de gallo served with them. One of my friends ordered the nachos and cheese. There was almost more cheese on the plate than chips. That was $6. The service was not good. Before we were able to order out drinks, the hostess had to come check all of our IDs. The waitress was not able to do this.

I couldn't taste any alcohol whatsoever, and barely got a buzz off an entire pitcher. I would say if they made their drinks stronger the atmosphere is nice and it would be a great place to come on a Saturday night with friends, but I can go elsewhere for a stronger drink!\n\nI ordered the cheese enchiladas, they come with rice and beans. For $13 I expected fresh and quality food. Instead I got what looked like it came straight from the mircowave to my table. A greasy-oily slop of cheese over some stale tasting sauce and hard tortilla underneath it. The beans were crisp and splitting open (definitely mircowaved) and the taste overall was stale, mircowaved and greasy. The point of mexican food is the freshness and this was definitely not fresh. I sent it back after two bites and did not order anything else. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a veggie burrito and it was dripping with water from the old mushrooms that were inside. But I have to say, the presentation of the burrito looked nice it was just the taste of it that really did not settle. He was so hungry he ate it anyways.\n\nI would say for the people who are running this place, make sure your kitchen is not reheating old and stale food because customers can tell the difference. The quality of the food and your business would strengthen so much if you had fresh ingredients and not just slop on a plate."

Having worked in restaurants for years, I actually couldn't believe a chef would allow a dish to come out of the kitchen looking like this. The fish was fried to a crisp - so crispy I couldn't even chew it, and coated in cheddar cheese with no other toppings. No pico, no cabbage, just awful. I sent it back and made dinner at home.

        "text": "The cactus! My boyfriend an I have been coming for for about 5 years now and absolutely love this place. \n\nAs far as their food goes-  they have great food specials, from 35 cent wings to half off appetizers. I have to say, their wings are some of the best I've ever had. It's very unexpected, coming from a Mexican restaurant. However, they use a sweet and spicy mesquite barbecue sauce that is second to none. Very good, and their wings are also large, juicy, and not at all overcooked. Also, their nachos are excellent. This is coming from a girl who orders nachos basically everywhere that serves them. I would have to say the \"cactus nachos with chicken added\" are the best in Philadelphia. Their cheese sauce is a blend of cheeses and Mexican corn- very delicious. As for the rest of their food, I have had their chicken fajitas which were also very good. I usually just come for the wings and nachos because they are so great. \n\nIn terms of their drinks, I'm a big margarita girl. When I first started going here they had the best margaritas. When one of the main bartenders left, the margaritas seemed to go down hill and the recipe changed. However, that same bartender returned a few months ago and I could see she fixed the recipe back to what it was before. I saw a previous review that described their margaritas as tasting like sprite or soda water.  To be honest, 6 months ago I would have agreed. However, once she returned to cactus the margaritas taste much much better, like they used to be. \n\nAs for their service, the service is quick. I'm often surprised by how quickly I receive my food and drinks. The owner is especially helpful. He is always running food and drink orders or bartending when large crowds come in. With that said, he always comes around and asks about our experience and truly cares about whether we've had an enjoyable time. Over the years, we've gotten to know many of the bartenders and always have a good experience when we get to see them."

While the place itself might be narrow, it's not a huge deal.  There are usually plenty of places to sit.  The bartenders do a great job as well!  And most of all, we LOVE THEIR MARGARITAS!!!  I hated 'ritas until I had one here.  We usually get a pitcher because nobody wants just one glass. \n\nTrue, I've a stale tortilla once or twice (hence the loss of a star) but the salsa is good and the food is pretty consistent."

Can't beat it, and you don't have to wait for your food! My real issue is the wait staff, unfortunately. LOUD and shouting to each other about stuff we don't want to all know: how drunk you got recently, how much you dread turning 30, how you only plan to work there another year and then get a \"big girl\" job, how you don't consider bloody mary's to be an alcoholic beverage...  The place was nearly empty both times I was there for brunch and witnessed this, so it's loud enough that you can barely carry on a normal conversation at your table. It's not like you WANT to listen to these girls talk, but you HAVE to. It's a shame. Good music is playing. But you can barely hear it over the bartender and server's banter."

Sounds great! I'm diabetic so I inquired if they add simple syrup to it and if they did could they make it without. Our waitress said she'd go ask. She comes back to tell us the bartender can substitute it with Sprite or Club Soda. I said, no thanks, just make it with the ingredients listed -- tequila, triple sec, and fresh lime juice. She looked at me like I had 7 heads. Being with a group of 4, I relented because, it's Easter and it was probably her first day as a waitress. Well, needless to say, what came to the table was so disgusting I couldn't drink it. The others at the table agreed but drank what we called lemonade since there also was no tequila in it. Rough. The food was ok. Portions for the fajitas and fajitas salad were weak. Beef and chicken enchiladas were ok. Overall, never again. I'll  stay with Loco Pez, Hefe, Sancho Pistola, Adobe Cafe, anywhere that serves quality food and drinks, and even Chipotle before I go back to Cactus."

Their wings (only had them as their special) are actually pretty darn tasty. One of the better wing deals/taste in this area in my opinion.\n\nAll is all, just go to enjoy a pitcher of margaritas, sit at the bar and watch the Phils.

When talking about Mexican options in Manayunk, I usually describe it as the following - if you want GOOD Mexican, go to Taqueria Feliz. If you want BAR Mexican, go to Cactus. Bar Mexican I think is a pretty good description.\n\nThe times I've been here, it's never been outwardly horrible, but never really good either. Went here last night with some friends. The place was not even half full and we were sat in the back of the first floor. Which that's not a big deal at all, but it was no excuse for our server to be MIA through much of our meal. We were right next to the computer station and even when we were trying to get her attention for the check when she was standing RIGHT THERE, she would ignore us and run off. \n\nThe margaritas are a ripoff. We all realized we were ordering the same margarita type so we were like let's just get a pitcher. We asked how many drinks you got out of a pitcher and she told us 4-5. How many did we actually get? 3. We got 3 margaritas for the 3 of us. $28 pitcher. I'm sure you can do the math and realize that is a few bucks more per margarita than if we had just ordered them individually. \n\nThe food is alright. I mean, you by no means go here for a killer meal. You go here if you want cheap decent Mexican-like food. Their specials are pretty good - we all did the $6 quesadilla. I had the steak and it was good. Not amazing, but good. \n\nThey do have a lengthy tequila menu so if tequila is your thing, this may be a good stop. But don't waste your $$ on the pitchers of margaritas. I mean, I don't mind paying top dollar for a GOOD margarita but like other reviews have stated, their margs are all mix.\n\nWill I be back? Sure, if I'm with people that want to go. But I don't go out of my way to eat here."

Michael (daytime manager and bartender extraordinaire!) and Tony hooked me up last minute with the best deal in town and no one could tell the party wasn't planned weeks in advance!  We had about 40 people in the upstairs area of the bar with a private bartender and an open bar which included a selection of craft beers.  They put out appetizers including their famous wings and had a DJ spinning great music, you would think I paid a fortune for such a great atmosphere, but it was actually cheaper per person than the deal stupid Flat Rock was offering!  The service was exceptional and everyone had a great time.  \n\nIn my other experiences at Cactus, the food is great.  The Cactus Nachos with pulled pork are so delicious and a total guilty pleasure.  On the lighter side, I almost always order the fajita salad with chicken.  The sangria is also wonderful and they have a great selection of Tequila for every price range.  \n\nIf you are looking for great tex-mex food and a laid back and friendly atmosphere, visit Cactus, you won't be disappointed!"

Unfortunately as far as being a Mexican food restaurant/bar, they failed for me. Starting with their chips and salsa(no bueno), I really value servers input on food especially if they have drinks available to pair. The Margarita was very sweet with very little alcohol(not a big drinker btw), when I asked what was good at this Mexican restaurant I was told, \"our pulled pork.\" Umm...so I rolled with the punches and followed my servers recommendation and ordered a pulled pork burrito with an additional $2 for extras(what I thought was guacamole, lettuce, etc) it was just a burrito with below average pulled pork. It was also covered in cheese(which who doesn't love cheese) but the cheese wasn't very appetizing. I also enjoy nice presentation and as you can see, my burrito wasn't even centered on the plate. This place is on a very busy street so I really hope I was just there on a bad night. Cheers"

I also am a frequent patron at the Bayou next door and have participated in Manayunk sport and social for several seasons.\n\nAll that being said, I was appalled at the service I received at Cactus last night! Sorry for the length of this post, but I really want to paint you the whole picture. \n\nThe manager, Tony, was our server . After waiting at the front door for about 5 minutes ( I get it , he was checking to see if people at the bar were waiting for a table, fine ) Tony comes over and without using any words points to my boyfriend and points to a table that was available ... 15 minutes after being seated Tony comes around and asks if we are ready to order drinks. By this point we were ready to order our drinks and food ! Tony scoffs at both me and my boyfriends drink orders when I ordered a blue moon and he ordered a cocktail. He suggests that my boyfriend gets a different cocktail with better alcohol in it for a dollar more. It was under the margaritas so I thought that sounded good too (foolish of me) . When I told Tony I would take that too he asked if i \"could handle it\" and then told us he likes to call them \" roofy-ritas\"!!!!\n\nAnd that they are how he \" got his wife\" (real cute....) \n\nI should have changed my mind right then and there but I try not to take things too seriously so I shrugged that COMPLETELY INAPPROPRIATE NICKNAME FOR A DRINK off and went against my better judgement and got it anyway...\n\nThe drink was disgusting. \n\nI ordered 2 waters with our drinks...never got them. Tony said he would bring over our salsa and chips... he never did. \n\nI will say my fish tacos were pretty good but my boyfriends meal came out wrong, very disappointing.\n\nTony came over to ask me if I needed a water to help wash down my \"roofy-rita\" and I said yes I would actually like water ( considering I ordered it in the first place) ... once again he never brought it.\n\nAt the end of the meal my boyfriend gave Tony his card to pay the bill. Over 10 minutes later Tony comes back to our table looking at us wondering if we needed anything else. We pointed out that we had already given him the card to pay the bill and Tonys face immediately turned to panic as I watched him wandering around the bar looking for the card and the bill! \n\nLike I said I try not to take things too seriously , but I have been bothered by the language the manager , the level of service, and complete lack of any sign of professionalism at this establishment , since leaving dinner last night."

To start, the chips and salsa were actually okay, the salsa had a slightly smokey flavor and they came as soon as we sat down. However, that's where it ends. We ordered the cactus margaritas and it was nothing like a margarita, more like lime soda and vodka. Still it cost $22. We also ordered nachos which were okay but more like something a home cook would make. Finally, we ordered fish tacos and a lime steak quesadilla. The tacos came out with un-melted shredded cheese (like you buy in a bag from the grocery store) and overly deep fried tilapia. It came with rice which was unseasoned expect for some cumin. The quesadilla was mostly sour cream, unfortunately you could feel it squeezing out when you took a bite so it wasn't very appetizing.

But the last 2 times I was there the bar manager , I don't know his name and don't care to know it was very unwelcoming. I am an African American man and I have never come across such blatant racism in my life. The first time I encountered his behavior was the visit before this one. My friends and I entered and he stated their where no sitting accommodations when 3 empty seats where at the bar. We took the seats at the bar and he seemed to get upset. My guess is because it was wing night and he assumed my friends and I were not purchasing drinks and he didn't want us taking up space in the restaurant for a small order. Contrary to his beliefs we ordered a pitcher of margaritas \" which as stated in other reviews were weak and unoriginal and I agree\" as well as wings, nachos  and 2 drinks which totaled 60 bucks and tipped our bartender 15% all while the manager surveyed us from the corner of his eye all night. The feeling was so uncomfortable that I told my friends I would never go back again. Somehow, my friends persuaded me to go back hoping that the manager was not on duty that night. Unfortunately, he was yesterday and he had the same racist disposition as he had before. As soon as we entered the establishment his face turned beet red and he harshly said some one will seat you in a minute. When we were seated he tells our waitress to remind us that if we only want .35 wings we have to pay a $2.00 upcharge for water. The tension was so thick I could feel it and while we were placing our orders he was staring at us the whole time. The straw that broke the camels back is when my friend ordered a long island ice tea. The waitress put the order in with him and his exact words were \"tell her this is not on special\". Our whole table heard him say it and my friends response to the waitress was, there's no need to convey that message. I had finally had it. I waited till he completed the drink order told my friends to get up from the table and leave because I could not spend my hard earned money at an establishment that didn't appreciate my patronage. I walked over and kindly told our waitress in front of him to cancel our entire order. I explained to them both that this was the second time I had been there and felt as if my money yes\" BLACK\" money was not welcomed in this establishment and how uncomfortable the bar manager made us feel. I asked him why he felt the need to emphasize that my friends drink was not on special. His reply was \"I tell everyone what the specials are\" and had the audacity to ask another couple to cosign his blatant racism which they declined to get involved. Needless to say they can pour those drinks out and I will never spend another dime at Cactus ever again and I suggest any one of color to do the same. Its despicable that in this day and time I felt like I was at a sit-in at a Woolworth counter in the 1960's trying to get good service. Although, I tried not to let his ignorance ruin my night, sadly it did!!!!!"

The total bill came to $25.  \n\nThe not-so-good:  Since our group was so large we sat in the dimly lit back of the restaurant - half booth half chairs.  The air duct over the booth seating was dripping with condensation and half our party got a little wet (it was a small price to pay for being in a nicely air-conditioned space on a hot July evening).  The chips were a little stale, but I'm being bratty by complaining because they were FREE.  The margaritas were heavy on the mix, light on tequila but for $10 a pitcher I'm compelled to lower my standards.\n\nOn a separate occasion I came with a smaller group & sat outside for their happy hour.  Again, specials were great & the staff were very accomodating.  The only problem I had was with the tiny tables - our group of 3 ordered the nachos & portabello quesadillas to split.  Our 4-top table couldn't accomodate 3 small appetizer plates & 2 entree sized plates & it was a little tricky trying to find a spot to rest your drink.\n\nExpect what you pay for - and you'll have an enjoyable time @ HH with Cactus."

It was some excellent Tex-Mex, loaded with chili flavor but never too hot for comfort. My Malbec was tasty and my lady's margaritas were very fruity, just to her taste.

I have never been to an establishment where you pay a premium for buying in bulk.\n\nWe also ordered the nachos with guacamole and chicken (each of which commanded an additional $2 charge).  When the nachos arrived, it was obvious they didn't include additional chips for the added portions and the chip to topping ratio was amiss.  Needless to say, we tried to make the best of it but were left with no chips and unconsumed food.  We asked for additional chips but were told we couldn't have any.

He recommended that we order some of the wings, which were .25 on Wednesdays, and different than your usual buffalo wings. They are a smokey mix of a chipotle bbq sauce and wing sauce. I was really glad he did, as they were awesome, fried to crispy perfection. \n\nThey also have a pretty impressive beer selection.

Once we ordered (another ~ 10 minutes), we didn't see our waiter again until the bill.  Apps took quite a bit of time to get to the table, my margarita sat at the bar for a good 10 minutes before it reached the table, our dinners came out while we were still eating the app, and they gave me pork instead of beef in my enchiladas.\n\nSo how good is the food?  Well, there salsa might be the best I've ever had.  I love their margaritas, and both the pork and beef enchiladas were solid - yes, they corrected my order without an issue.

Because this is a popular college destination, you can usually count on a bouncer barring access on those nights. That being said, Cactus is really popular and is usually packed to the gills with that crowd on the weekends.\n\nOnce you're inside, the decor is fairly spartan, although the walls are bright shade of golden yellow, which evokes the southwestern/Mexican theme. My friends and I got a pitcher of sangria, which was a little watered down to my taste, but it was really cheap on special, so that was a win. \n\nI also ordered the beef enchiladas, which were all right--they came absolutely covered in cheese, which overpowered the simple beef flavors within (I say simple because it was just mildly spiced ground beef inside). Rice and black beans (not refried) come on the side. This kind of food is great for a late Saturday evening snack (or really late dinner) if you're out on the town.\n\nThe salsa for the chips basket is indeed delicious and has just the right burn. I gobbled that up fairly quickly. Just to clear up the question of the \"free\" chips and salsa: first round is always on the house. If you ask for another basket, you pay $4 for the pleasure of getting unlimited refills of the basket for the rest of the night.\n\nThe service was really good, though, and the waiter didn't even bat an eye at the wildly inappropriate conversation that was going on under his nose, so kudos to him!"

They must have read my review because now they have plenty of servers and a bartender who has plenty of time to make you a drink and have a friendly chat!\n\nThe seem to also have expanded their brew menu by adding some Philadelphia Brewing Company(!!!!) and other microbrews.

Perfect excuse to have a second dinner elsewhere after coming here.\n\nThe prices are decent and chips and salsa are good. That is about it.

After sitting here at a table for 20 minutes, I'm writing this review before I get up and leave.\n\nWe saw the GM/owner standing in the doorway, asked if they had a bar, and when he said yes, asked of we could have a table outside and sat down.  With 8 tables outside, there are 3 girls at one table, already with drinks, the other tables all set but empty.  We sat, he went inside (I thought to get menus for us)\n\nAfter about 5 minutes, my girlfriend got up to go inside and had to ask the same guy for menus.  No excuse for not knowing we were sitting there now!\n\nAfter 5 more minutes, same older man in a polo shirt came out and sat 2 women next to us.  With in 2 minutes a waitress came out to take their drink order.  Asked if they had any questions on menu, and then took their food order!  She looked at me (as she had to squeeze past to get by as we were closest to the sidewalk) and said \"I'll be right with you\".  After a few minutes she came back out and went to the first table of girls to take another drink order, looked at use and went back inside.  After 5 minutes, with not even a glass of water, and the table after us placing their drink and food order, I decided to poke my head in the door to see if they were just really slammed...they're not. There's maybe 8 people total inside.  i'm going to put my phone down for 10 min before I start writing this review incase they come out with an excuse for the lack of service, or just wont come over with my phone out.\n\nIts now been 25+ minutes total.  No waitress, no drinks, no chance in hell I'm going to sit here like a fool and wait to be disappointed even more.  I don't care if they have kobe beef tacos with free tequila shots, I'm going next door where I know I can get good food and equally as good service.\n\nI highly recommend avoiding this place.

I used to watch this show a lot with Cynthia (my ex-wife) but she was always more of a CSI: NY fan. \n\nI know that's not what caused us to split, something so trivial. But it just became a thing where I'd come home from the office (I'm an actuary). I mean, I love my line of work. Risk valuation is a constant challenge. And I just got some new responsibilities training kids just out of college starting out as actuaries. But I let the stress get to me, I guess. But we have some deadlines we have to meet for our client before they can start constructing that parking garage in Conshohocken and the risk modelling can get a bit difficult. \n\nI really needed to learn to not take my job home with me. I wish I had a better work/life balance. I mean, what's more important -- being there for Bradley and Bryan (our twin sons) for their dance recital or staying home to crunch Excel spreadsheets? I just really messed a lot of things up and I know that no but it's too late. 14-years of marriage gone. \n\nAnyways, the brunch at Cactus is TREMENDOUS. It's a simple little buffet -- nothing too fancy, but all of it so tasty! The western hash browns were cooked just right, scrambled egg bin was done to perfection and they even had some soft-shelled taquitos. I had a Bloody Mary and it was too spicy, but to be fair I made it myself at the Bloody Mary bar so it was my fault, like everything has been for 14 years."

After trying the Cactus in Manayunk I believe we found a place that could easily be considered the equal of places such as that. They started us off with an order of chips and salsa as good as any I've had, and we ordered a corona tower that held about 8 beers for only $25(great deal). For an appetizer we ordered the Santa Fe Eggrolls and \"Fire Cracker\" jalape\u00f1o poppers. Both were delectable, and while I'm usually skeptical about ordering poppers because you never seem to get enough for the price, they were at least 3X the size of what you would normally expect and easily enough for the four of us. I ordered steak fajitas for my entree and they were very satisfying for the price. Overall the service was great and it was an overall pleasant experience. They have outdoor seating right on Main Street and we will definitely be back Sunday for their all you can eat brunch buffet and $2.50 mimosas and bloody Mary's."

My boyfriend and I came on a Thursday night and ordered a pitcher of margaritas and we both got the chicken tacos. The pitcher of classic margs was actually an overflowing pitcher filled with ice and a splash of margarita mix from the grocery store and maybe one shot of tequila in the whole pitcher. They were the worst margs I've ever tasted. The chicken in the tacos was literally rubber and my boyfriends tacos came out with the toppings he asked them to leave off. He would have sent them back but no one checked on us or asked how everything was.  Do not waste your time or money at this awful \"mexican\" place. Go to taqueria Feliz or la roca if you're on Main Street."

Both of us ended up having the Pasion de Fresca (strawberry) margaritas and they were amazing.  We both agreed we would make this the first stop on a weekend night before heading out.  We got the small plate of classic nachos and they were the perfect amount for the two of us to share and the free chips and salsa were great.  Some other reviewers mentioned that theirs had been stale, but that certainly wasn't the case for us and we loved the guacamole.  It's a little small inside (at least on the first floor) and we were seated at a table by the door, so it did get chilly once more people started coming in and out, but I wouldn't count that against the place.

I felt like I was fresh out of college.  We grabbed a round of drinks which were moderately priced and ordered Cactus nachos. There was some kind of creamy corn sauce on the chips. The first couple of bites tasted great but my stomach felt like lead after 3 chips. These nachos are loaded and the \"small\" portion is huge. It also looked like there was an entire pint of sour cream dumped on top of the nachos. Four friends couldn't finish half of the dish.\n\nCactus nachos weren't bad, but I'd never make the trek out to Manayunk just to eat there. I'm spoiled with Loco Pez, Dos Segundos, and Sancho Pistola's all within walking distance."

        "text": "Let me preface this that the if I could give 5 stars for the wings and salsa..I would. \n\nCactus is usually my go-to for cheap wings on Thursday's, but lately I've become more and more disappointed and it stems from the absolutely poor service.\n\n1. Do not order a soda unless you ask beforehand if there are free refills. I found this out the hard way because despite not being charged for refills on the various occasions (10+ times I've been there) I was charged. I asked the waitress about this and she said \"it depends on who is working as to who charges you\"... which is my opinion is ridiculous. Also- I can't even remember the last time I was ever charged for a refill at any restaurant I've been to.\n\n2. The drinks are very watered down. I ordered a pitcher of margaritas with my friends and it was 10% alcohol / 90% juice. I wouldn't waste your money on those.\n\n3. The manager is very rude almost every time I'm there. \n\n4. The service is slow and almost non existent. (This is not all of the time.. There have been times my waitresses has been awesome) In particular, last night our waitress took 20 minutes to bring us our drinks and chips and salsa. She never asked us for refills on anything. In addition, she also forgot to bring my friend her food.. I can't imagine tacos take an hour to make. \n\nIt's unfortunate because sometimes I go to cactus and everything is great, but lately I've been walking out disappointed. I will likely go back intermittently because you can't beat 10 wings for 3.50, but I would never go there for any other food. If you want good Mexican, you should walk down to La Taqueria Feliz.. much better food and service."

The only employee visible was the bartender who let us seat ourselves but quickly approached us with chips and salsa.  She was pleasant and helpful throughout our service. She was very attentive considering she had to wait on 3 tables, make the drinks, and run up and down stairs to retrieve the food.  Her service was 5 stars.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of Sangria, chicken enchiladas and a loaded 5-alarm burrito.  Sangria was definitely premixed, but delicious. It had plenty of alcohol for my liking.  My girlfriend's enchiladas were flavorful and chicken was moist. My burrito was well seasoned throughout and very fresh. In my opinion,  the enchilada sauce is not authentic, but it didn't detract too much from the rest of the meal.  Food was 4 stars.\n\nThe decor and feel of the place is very much main street Manayunk.  Clean and modern eatery during the day, but obvious night life place for social drinks.  Simple wall decor with multiple chalkboards displaying the drink specials caters more to the drinking crowd. Decor was 4 stars.\n\nOverall we were pleased with this experience and would recommend it to others.  I'm disappointed that previous reviews say poor things about the Margaritas, but we did avoid them for that reason. Perhaps we will try them ourselves on a future visit."

It was not my first time at Cactus and I didn't remember loving it but wanted to give it another chance.  We ordered from the very limited menu some nachos and some tacos to share.  I felt prices were way too high for the volume of food we got.  Our order took FOREVER and everyone around us seemed to get their food way ahead of us.  We saw a waiter carry our food and then he was staring at it really closely.  He showed another waiter and then headed back downstairs.  This was concerning.  When the nachos finally arrived they seemed much smaller than expected, as though someone had scraped off all the side nachos.  We got vegetarian nachos and yet there was chicken sprinkled all throughout.  Obviously they had realized that we didn't order the chicken and tried just scraping it off and hoping we wouldn't notice.  Fortunately I eat meat so it was okay, but what if I had been really allergic to chicken or a vegetarian?\n\nThe food was okay but not great and given the prices I really don't see any need to go back to Cactus again.

The hot sauce helped.\n- Queso dip was ordered by a friend and I didn't try - but they left 75% of it behind.\n- Seasoned fries: These were NOT seasoned.

She brought back two glasses when there were three of us at the table. At this point we are all just confused at the service. \n\nFinally - the tacos arrive. They looked underwhelming but I was so hungry I took a bite right away. It tasted bland so I opened it to put hot sauce on it.

It was very smooth and sweet, which are terrible adjectives salsa at a Mexican place. My friend and I got the veggie [mushroom] burrito. It was ok. Not the worst, but definitely not the best. It had some flavors coming through from the mushroom, rice, and beans, but was lacking seasoning and a bit of salt. It was also a bit dry on the inside."

The taco shells look like the type you buy from the supermarket, they put too much cheese on their nachos (which, seriously, for me is basically impossible).  HOWEVER, they give you free chips and salsa, which is always a plus, the service is friendly, and they have cheap margs.  It's worth a shot for people on a budget or people who want to get marg-wasted.  But, if you care about the quality of your food, you should go to tacqueria feliz a few blocks down the street."

Fortunately for me, Cactus was totally a hit!\n\nGranted, I hadn't eaten all day, and by six ish this girl was STARVING. Our original restaurant plan ended up being closed on Mondays (why do people do that?), and I remembered a friend telling me about the Monday specials at Cactus. Turned out to be 9 dollar fajitas, any style, and 10 dollar (!) house margarita pitchers. \n\nThe margs ended up being delicious, and surprisingly strong and labor intensive for 10 dollars. We sat the bar; I like to do this in order to stare down my bartender to ensure maximum tequila pours. JK. Kind of. The whole menu looked delicious, if you know what you're getting yourself into. Guys, this is total Tex Mex; not authentic by any stretch. To save myself time and deliberation, we both just got the pulled pork fajitas after the bartender assured us anything with pulled pork was their specialty. And the meat was really good, guys. Tasty and tender. Nothing ground breaking about the fajitas, but everything tasted pretty fresh. Ingredients that were supposed to be cold were cold and ingredients that were supposed to be hot were hot. Service at the bar, even by a bartender in training, was excellent as well. BF and I stuffed ourselves and got a little tipsy (maybe mostly me) for under 40 bucks. steal in manayunk!\n\nAs with any other nearby location, go to Manayunk on OFF nights. Mondays & Tuesdays. Go early or late, depending on when the place is least crowded. Sitting at the bar generally ensures better service, bartenders in Manayunk have the slowest turnovers and are generally better than the waitstaff. Not the rule, just a suggestion."

Unfortunately tonight was not what were used to when we came to pick up a takeout order. Servers and bartenders were pulling down masks while leaning in to talk to patrons and making drinks without masks on. \n\nFood was not nearly as good as usual. The fajitas were the smallest portion I've ever seen. The steak burrito was all fat. The wings were so overdone the bones were cracked and splintered. \n\nI understand COVID has upended many things, but this was beyond anything reasonable."

I went during the Manayunk Art Festival so I feel like the business of the day was difficult as it is. We weren't able to grab a table outside but they were still able to seat us inside immediately, despite having a larger group of people. \n\nWe decided to order guacamole and a pitcher of sangria for the table. They didn't have enough sangria for a pitcher, so we ended up not being able to get some. That was kind of disappointing that they couldn't make more. I ended up ordering a berry margarita and it was just okay. It seemed like it came from a mix because there were clumps of mix throughout but despite that, the flavor was good. As for the guacamole, it left much to be desired. It tasted like they just mashed up some avocados with some other veggies and that was it. It had no spices or other flavors in it. We ended up asking for salt and pepper and I took the lime from my margarita and put the juice in it. After that, it was decent, but I wouldn't get it again. \n\nThe other food we ordered was just okay. Two of my friends got quesadillas and they looked pretty good. They didn't have any complaints about them. My boyfriend and I ordered the pulled pork tacos to share and honestly they were pretty tasty. The pulled pork was flavorful and went well in the taco. I would get it again if I came back. \n\nAs for the service, it was eh. I felt bad for the waitress, however because of how busy it was and she had to keep coming upstairs for us as we were the only table up there. She did a good job though for what she had to deal with so I didn't mind that it was slow. \n\nI don't know if I would go out of my way to return to Cactus, but I might return again in the future to give them another chance!"

The spice level was high but my girlfriend and I both did not care for it and the waiter was nice enough to take it off the check.\n\nChips and Salsa - First round is for free! If it is free it is for me! Or is it? The reason I pose this question is because the chips were not hot and the sauce by God man you MUST have good salsa if you are going to call yourself a Mexican restaurant! If you are looking for sauce with a good kick go to Taqueria Felix.\n\nSanta Fe Eggrools - This was the winner of the day. Chicken, corn, and black beans stuffed in a very soft pastry like egg roll cut up into about 6 small pieces with some ranch dipping side in the middle. This appetizer goes for $9.95 at full price. Didn't seem like a steal of deal but food was improving after the first two fails.\n\nSteak Fajitas - The steak was much better then expected. I have had the Fajitas several times at the Cactus's competitor Taqueria Felix and I can say hands down the Fajitas at this place are the better deal. \n\nI would not run back to this place but would certainly entertain the idea of coming back for a happy hour.

There was no order around the place so I just went up to the table and asked if I could order. It was roughly 7:20ish. He goes IM NOT TAKIN ANYMORE ORDERS UNTIL 10/11. \n\nI was like uh...what about margaritas. Here's the thing. We saw the sign. Says margaritas. (We being the boyfriend and I) we are like hell yeah. Just got our tacos from taqueria feliz (they dropped the ball a little but even in them dropping the ball their service is phenomenal) we were hype to see such easy access to margaritas. \n\nSo I ask about the margaritas. He says oh yeah I can do that. I ask if he does non frozen. He looks and says I only have mango (not the answer to my question but cool since that's what the bf and I want) so he goes makes them. They're huge. I'm hype. (Although he did put the straw in with his bare hands. Oh yeah no mask no gloves nothing) The outdoor menus says taco Tuesdays $5 margaritas. \n\nMakes them. Hands them over. $40. I literally felt my heart skip a beat. WHAT?! He says 32oz $40. I said but the sign it says $5 for Tuesday's. He goes that's in house only. \n\nSIR WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU HAD IN HOUSE SERVICE?! \n\n\nSo I'm looking because the sign that says frozen margaritas which is on the other wall doesn't have any price. Just \"FROZEN MARGARITAS ORIGINAL/MANGO/CHERRY\" \n\nNo price. \n\nHe goes if you don't want them I'll take them back. I hesitated and the only got one. Highway robbery. Period. \n\nIt's wildly unacceptable to have that up there....KNOW YOU HAVE SPECIALS EVERY DAY....and then say oh but those are in house. As if there's not a pandemic. Other places still have their daily deals. I didn't think anything of it that they had their daily deals as well. \n\n\n\nMan....so now I'm drinking a watered down margarita because (it was with chopped ice) and out $20 instead of $10. \n\nI hope no one else is swindled by them. Hence my yelp review. \n\nI would have done better going and getting a cider from my local sandwich shop.\n\n\nEdit: this has no alcohol in it. Makes sense why I wasn't carded."

        "text": "3/2/2021 ~ Recently took a trip to Main St in Manayunk and ended up at Cactus: Restaurant & Bar. In my younger days I used to frequent Main Street for many a happy hour and cheap, but delectable eats. That being said it's been some time since I've done so and yesterday brought back a feeling of nostalgia. After a circuit workout with a friend we decided that we deserved a treat for our hard work and stopped in for some food and drinks. We were greeted by the bartender/server and were told to sit anywhere we liked (seating was limited due to covid restrictions). It wasn't very busy as there were only a couple tables, but the server/bartender did a good job of working the restaurant to make sure everyone was tended to. Once informed that Tuesday was $2 taco night it was an easy decision, tacos it was. I tried each of the tacos (beef, chicken, and pork) and they were pretty basic tacos with meat, lettuce, and cheese with sour scream and hot sauce on the side. I'm not going to lie, the tacos were a little dry and nothing exceptional to write home about but for $2 who can complain. Wings were also had and thoroughly devoured. The wings come in orders of 10 and are fried hard just like I like, they come with ranch on the side as well. For drinks I had a mango-jalape\u00f1o margarita, which was very nicely done, that had a decent spice to balance the sweet mango flavor. I also enjoyed the Cactus margarita which was just a plain margarita but it again was nicely done. The ambiance does leave a little to be desired, but I kind of like the understated nature of the d\u00e9cor as it fits the \"theme\" of the restaurant//bar. I would definitely tell people to check this place out, but fair warning it's nothing fancy. It's a no frills restaurant/bar with cheap eats, solid drinks, and interesting playlist that caters to a younger crowd."
