It's greasy unhealthy American-Chinese food thats cheap and has way too much salt. You know they don't serve general tso's in China right? But for what it is it's a cheap and solid dinner. The General Tso's Dinner box is is a typical combo of egg roll rice and the chicken. It's pretty good but I'd only say it's an average 3 stars, nothing sticks out. The real reason I order from Golden Chopsticks quite often is their fried meat dumplings. These are the thick heavy doughy dumplings, not the thin potstickers you might be used to and you get 8 with an order for less than 6 bucks. It's a lot of food and make sure you sleep with water next to your bed because it's very salty, in a good way. So again for what they are aiming for, they do a pretty decent job. Don't skip on the dumplings!"

Lo mein here has become consistently greasy & has a lovely burnt flavor. It's so oily that I leave the last few mouthfuls so I don't have a heart attack on the spot. The food here overall is overpriced and crappy. The one thing I order [shrimp w/broccoli] is really hard to F up, but eating with other folks has shown me how hit or miss GC is. For some reason it always takes 10 light years to get the food when I order in store for sit-down service. That gives me homicidal thoughts that I can't shake for days.\n\nThis place isn't even trying anymore. They know they don't have to because an entire neighborhood that's flush with cash thinks GC is the only viable option for Chinese. See all the reviews post 2008? They ain't lyin.

But other foods (fries and miso soup) are perfect cheap lunch go tos. Their miso soup gets an A+. The broth is delicious and theres an almost absurd amount of tofu and seaweed. Perfection.

This place is mainly take out so eating there isn't really an experience. A lot of time if it is the employees on lunch break or groups of students, you can them talking.

When you walk in you immediately see that the place is busy with college students and other working people. So I wait in line just like the rest of the people waiting to order. So I get to the front and excepted a rude impatient female or male just like any other takeout place. But notice when I was talking that they was actually friendly and listening to my order. She repeated my order in a nicely calm person just to make sure that she had everything I said. For the people wondering what did I ordered. I got the general chicken lunch platter with wonton soup and egg roll and 4 chicken wings.  While I was waiting, on my right I seen that they won an award for best general chicken in Philadelphia. I forgot what year but it wasn't old. Being a \"food critic\" I wanted to see if it was really award type general chicken. So I went back to the front and waited. They call my number and I got my food then went to have a seat at one of the booths. When I sat down, I smelled the sauce and it smelled wonderful. When picked up the chicken, the sauce was coming down and I knew it was gonna be good. So tasted it and the chicken was steaming hot, fresh, big, moist, tender, and REAL. I can taste the hard work they put into it. I can see why they won an award, and the most important thing about it is that they are consistent. I can see why they're busy every single day. Not because most of their demographic is college students, it's because of consistently and freshness of it. My overall rating is 5/5 stars."

They clearly thought there were more than two people dining because we got 4 fortune cookies.

The people at the counter are very gruff and business-like, but I think they secretly enjoy their clientele -- they always remember our usual order when my boyfriend and I go in. \n\nAs for the food, I love it. It just tastes... cleaner, less greasy, than other places. I can't really explain it, it's just less shady. The chicken looks like chicken. The veggies look like real, crisp, good veggies. And when you order a dish, they always PACK the extras on. You'll never have enough rice to eat all of the veggies and meat you get [and they have pretty nice take-out containers, too]. \n\nAs for delivery, they usually send a little guy on a motorbike. Just watch when using a credit card -- they often make the guy bring \"the machine\", which swipes your card and prints out a little receipt, but has been known to ghetto it up and not work on occasion. Sometimes they forget to tell the guy to bring the machine, too, so I've had to give the guy my cell phone to call the place before. So that's a little weird.

There was only one time when I actually enjoyed my food, but usually the chicken I order comes half-cold (like, half of the piece of chicken is freezing and the other half is blazing... very strange) and very rubbery, yet dry... kind of like it's not really chicken. The vegetarian spring rolls I have ordered have been decent-tasting, but very greasy. I've ordered Lo Mein a couple times, and it's all stuck together and half-cold.

Out of the three I take Golden Chopstick.  I've eaten both in the restaurant (only to check out where I was ordering from), and then mostly takeout.  The restaurant is clean, service is quick and the food is hot and tasty.  Plus, they never adhere to the \"$10 min\" delivery rule which is great for a single meal.  Groundbreaking, no.

What a stupid idea. Anyway, I have only gotten china-food while living here from Mandarin Garden, which was the least terrible choice from what I had tried. I saw that Golden Chopsticks had a lot of mixed ratings, and hoped to catch them on a good day. \n\nI did not.\n\nThe Food:\n\n- Crab Rangoon: It was so overcooked it wasn't funny. I was afraid of breaking a tooth when I chomped into it. It also had that fishy smell that I HATE and makes it hard for me to order crab rangoon from anywhere else for a long time. I didn't finish it, bros. \n\n- Pork Fried Rice: Pork had a burnt taste and the rice was way way overdone. Also was made completely wrong, as I ordered it with no onion and carrot and it had copious amounts of both. Gross. How do you eff up rice, brohammers?\n\nThe Service:\n\n- Going to have to shed some blame on myself here. I had a feeling that, as most Chinese places in the city are staffed by people who speak very poor English, ordering via grubhub would be a bad idea. It was, and I won't do it again. Sorry, chinabroheim. \n\n- When the delivery guy got here, he was rude and short with me. He was knocking on my neighbors door, and called me gibbering about me not being home and wasting his time. Chill out, broseph! The delivery took way too long for Chinese food that simple. \n\nThe Rating:\n\nI give it two stars because I think I may have eaten more of the fried rice if it was made the way I wanted it to be made. I just hate onions. On the whole, though,I really do not recommend this place. Bad food, poor service. Yuck.  Why is it so freaking hard to find Chinese food that is consistently good in Fairmount!?

Giving outrageously low ratings to someone running a business because you have a self-entitled , First World Problem issue?  If you are charging less then $10 on a credit card you are actually costing them money each time they serve you. You are not a good customer. Pretty clear in their menu and adverts.

        "text": "I wish I could give this place less than one star. Lemmie set the scene for you: it's Wednesday evening and my girlfriend and I have a midterm the next day. We look at each other and figure fine we'll get Chinese food so you know more time to study. We pull up Golden Chopstick and peep the review. Well it's meh reviews but we've been procrastinating all week so decide ok. All of the sudden one of the pictures has a staple in the food; this is red flag number 1. But you know we're poor dental students so we give it a pass. So we order the food and not only does it take an hour and 20 minutes to get to us, but they forgot her rice too. Red flag number 2. We got general tso's chicken and a veggie lo mein, you know a casual order. So I hit em up like fam, where is my girl's rice? Who the hell eats just the chicken. (My apologies if you eat just the chicken). They credit us for the rice and I'm like fine. So we eat the food and we're like ok it's what we expected. Fast forward to 2 hours later.... my guy when I tell you that there is no pain like the wrenching of your stomach and fever that comes along with it you gotta believe me. My girl dips into the bathroom faster than OJ on a publicity opportunity and locks up in there for the next 1.5 hours. My homie our toilet hasn't smelled the same since. I can't even put my cheeks down knowing what kind of fire and fury has gone into it. I'm chilling consoling my girl then all of the sudden it hits me harder than my african Mom after seeing me sit on the couch with shoes on... we need a new toilet. I had the veggie lo mein only with no meat and somehow still managed to get food poisoning just not as sever as my girl. So we lost 4 hours dying in the bathroom and probably failed our midterm. I would avoid this place at all costs fam, they need to have a health inspector come through and re-evaluate their cleanliness. \n\nTLDR: eats Chinese food, bland and not flavorful, gets food poisoning, fails exam. Avoid this place."

Unfortunately, there wasn't as much heat as I hoped.  The service was friendly.  But since I ordered with a group, our food took much longer to be served.  The food portions were generous considering the price.  And not surprising, the quality of food was sacrificed.\n\nIf you're in the mood for Chinese, not looking to spend much, and aren't ordering in a group, Golden Chopstick should work out."

The restaurant itself is not in the greatest condition, so I recommend takeout or delivery. They have a very user friendly website for ordering, which I appreciate for ease, especially right now.\n\nYes, this place isn't fancy, but the food is consistently good, they have great prices, and they are reliable in the sense that my orders are always correct and made on time.\n\nI recommend the wonton soup, chicken and broccoli, any of the lo mein, and the fried chicken wings. My boyfriend loves these even though they are most definitely not Chinese food :)\n\nI will keep supporting this business knowing they are working hard to make good, affordable food, especially during this time!"

This is some of the best Chinese takeout food I've ever had in the city.\n\nLet's start with the vegetable dumplings. Usually at a Chinese restaurant, vegetable dumplings are all dumpling and shreds of  cabbage stuffed inside. You can actually see and taste the vegetables in these dumplings.\n\nMain courses also deliver. I ask for a special order... Chicken with string beans in white sauce. Outstanding! A small portion is actually two meals for me.  And vegetable lo mein is great... Not too oily.\n\nI cannot speak for the ambience. I've never eaten in, I get the impression this is just a takeout and delivery place for the most part."

But they should get someone else to handle Public relations. While theyre at it, they should hire someone to help oversee health and safety.  This A hole replies by apologizing for it not being up to my standards and and that it's just basically my own opinion. He ends by saying that reviews like mine make a difference on small businesses. And I agree, good and bad reviews SHOULD HAVE AN IMPACT. You really should VALUE your customers' opinions. You basically put it back on me and I've seen you do it with other negative reviews. How about instead of wasting everyone's time with your insincere comments, you spend the time cleaning up your place? Dude, your bathroom is still the bathroom straight out of trainspotting. I'm sure you still cook vegetables that have gone bad. Do you still have the fish tank that's half full and looks like the bottom of a swamp? Are your register clerks still rude as hell? Is your kitchen still gross with bugs on the backsplash? As I mentioned before, yes you should care about how these reviews affect your business. You should care about the community that you serve!

They have more restrictions like the atm minimum, the main space has gone downhill, they mainly deal with take out, and the young people they have dealing with the customers are just plain rude. All the while I'll see the the owner's son showing up to work in a nice Mercedes SUV. Clean the f-ing bathroom!? There bathroom is filthy. They have cockroach traps out in plain site in the bathroom. And they have an aquarium right inside the entry that has could give James Cameron's underwater explorations a run for his money. Not surprisingly they were closed down last year for health code violations. It wasn't long that they were back at it again. I'd stay away from this place if you want to maintain your health. It was alright while it lasted but the owner and his family needs to put some time and money back into this place and have some effing respect for their community and customers!"
