Indeed, there are restaurants that I go often, that they remember my orders, and that I tips decently (20%) - and I still see frown faces.\n\nSo, this is a nice change in this restaurant - which the waitress was friendly and with a smile when taking order.  And also inquiring whether I want water or tea.\n\nThe beef noodle is good - with quite a bit of beef, brisket and meatball.  The beef is tender, and the meatball is al dente.  The broth and noodle are decent though not wow.\n\nThey do takeout, and like most if not all Chinatown noodle shop- they will separate the soup and noodle if requested (keeping the noodle al dente)\n\nOverall, it is a 3.5 but given that they were willing to accept $11 for a $11.34 bill - as they didn't realize that I have change.  That gives them a 4 star.\n\nOne thing that they may want to consider is to provide ice water versus lukewarm water."

We got 2 soups, one with the Hakka noodles and the other with the rice noodles. The soups were a bit bland, the Hakka noodles weren't too good and most importantly the meat was chewy and tiny portions of meat for the price. My mom makes really good beef noodle soup, this was nowhere near it and the atmosphere was dead. Past it again last Friday, pretty much a dead spot when places nearby at happening. Sorry to say it but Hakka beef house was disappointing at best."

Overall I was very happy with the meal. \n\nWhen I got into the restaurant I got this sweetish tea which was strong in a glass cup. Then I got the beef noodle soup. The portion size was medium large for 8 dollars. I thought that the soup was very well balanced, because it was flavorful without being too salty. The bok choy seemed to also have a good fresh flavor, not too raw-tasting too. The soy egg inside was good and you could tell they braised the egg in sauce for a long time. The noodles were chewy in a good way and the service was fast.\n\nOverall I would come again to try the other menu items. For some reason its very empty and quiet here. I came on a Thursday night and there was no one else there the whole time. Maybe because they just opened."

My experience was limited to the three beef (Flank, Beef balls, and beef) dish with noodles.  I would say it was solidly good.  Not the very best I've ever tried, but good+.  The young woman who waited on me was great.  Her enthusiasm and pride for the food there was so obvious.  She explained what was in my bowl.  Brought me some hot oil, and was extremely attentive, bringing me more napkins when she saw I needed them.  A solid addition the Philly's asian noodle scene!!"

It's a clean and flavorful soup that warms you up. I finished the whole bowl including the broth, something that I rarely do when eating noodle soups. Both the noodles and beef were tender and had nice consistency and texture. The portion size left me quite satisfied and was overall a wholesome meal. I will definitely be coming back again!"

The person I came with immediately felt if it was a bad idea to remain but having had my eye on this place for a while, I chose to remain. Now, this place has pretty good reviews so I was especially interested in their Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. I got their tendon/tripe/omasum noodle soup and was not very impressed with the flavors. The soup was light but bland. Therefore, the tendon, tripe, and omasum was pretty bland as well. I would have preferred at least some soy sauce or sriracha on the side but they only had chili oil and vinegar. What saved the dish was the noodles. They were bouncy and chewy with the perfect amount of thickness. If you like something that's not too oily, light, and more subtly flavored, this would be the place for you. However, I prefer Spice C. \n\nThe person I went with got a rice dish and the meat was flavored pretty well. Maybe I should've gotten beef instead of the tendon/tripe/omasum but that's only if I come back next time."

This cuisine which is popular in parts of Southern China and especially in countries like Malaysia is widely known for its beef and noodle dishes.  This is an unassuming little space that the owners intend to improve upon in the coming weeks.  But they have already started to serve up the Hakkan food and I can tell you based on what I ate, it is tasty.  All the Hakka noodles are made in-house and they were perfectly cooked in my dish with a minced beef, bok choi, and bean curd.  The minced beef was extremely tender and flavorful. This is a dish where you mix everything together in the bowl, add some of their delicious housemade chili sauce and your mouth is full of different tastes with each bite.  A nice ten-herb soup began the meal.\n\nChinatown in Philly keeps evolving and it's nice now to welcome a Hakkan restaurant to its numbers.  And don't forget to try the Spicy Minced Beef w/ Hakka Noodles!"

To be fair, I was in the mood for a rice dish but ordered their Hakka Noodle with Beef on the recommendation of my friend who had been here several times. \n\nI actually thought their beef was quite tough unlike the other reviews here, but maybe I came on an \"off\" day as my friend also mentioned it usually was quite tender. The noodles were good but the broth was the clear standout winner. I've never had light broth so packed with flavor before, and it wasn't overly salty so quite drinkable. \n\nI ended up ordering the pig ear as well since I was still hungry after the noodles. It was covered with soy sauce, but I would much rather see that on the side! \n\nThere is stiff competition in the neighborhood for hand drawn noodle, so unfortunately I cannot declare Hakka as the top. However, the place is clean and modest, so you can't really go wrong."

Perfect portion size, well worth the money, tasty broth without being overpowering, well cooked beef. \nNice staff\nQuick service\nSimple atmosphere inside\n\nCons:\nGot the crispy beef buns as an appetizer and the cucumber was the same size as the beef, which just seemed like the wrong ratio. That and the bun (which I assume was supposed to be a soft consistency?) was I think overcooked and actually cracker like around the folded edge. \n\nIf there weren't another 1923812 places in China town I want to try I would definitely be back to try the other dishes!

They're fairly new and off the main path so I try to support them as much as possible; which is easy because I could eat here weekly.\n\nI've never strayed away from the Hakka noodle but am tempted to because the rest of their menu looks quite good. I've gotten both beef and brisket and prefer the beef because it's a little firmer and less fatty. The noodles are perfectly chewy and bouncy. The broth is rich but not fatty or slick with oil. It's pretty mild in taste so I'll add chili oil if I want a kick.\n\nWe love the fried beef baos and spicy garlic cucumber with fungus. The cucumber and fungus (if you're familiar with wood-ear mushrooms in other Chinese cuisine or dim sum that's what they mean by fungus) is so so good. It's deceptively simple but a great balance of flavors along with a refreshing contrast to the hearty soup.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and there is a good amount of seating (about 4-5 tables) and I've never had to wait. I love Hakka Beef House and hope they prosper!"

Better than spice C and nanzhou in my opinion.\n\nI got the beef tripe/tendon/omasun hakka noodle except I traded out the omasun for brisket. Next time I'm going to trade out the tripe for beef because damn that beef is BOMB. I got a piece of it in my noodle soup and it's just flavored so well. A hint of spice, perfectly tender, melts in your mouth, juicy from the broth. And the broth - it looks clear and unflavorful but it really delivers in flavor. It's a lighter broth but still very satisfying and it doesn't leave you feeling very heavy. I think it's quite healthy too. The noodles were something else - I loved the texture of them. I'm used to eating shaved noodles but I think Hakka noodles top them...and not only was the chewiness of the noodles spot on, the flavor was amazing too! Seldom do I notice the noodles themselves bursting with flavor but this restaurant really pulled it off well...the only thing I have to complain about is the tripe. Was not a fan of it - the texture was a bit off to me, almost a bit plastic-y in bite and chew, not like the tripe I'm used to eating in pho. The tendon was also a bit hard and not as melty and soft as I would like it so I would probably try a different noodle next time. \n\nOverall, really good place to go to. Portion size was very decent (left feeling absolutely stuffed) and the tea they serve is delicious (I asked what kind of tea it was and they said green but I don't believe them because I hate green tea and this stuff was heavenly. I think it was jasmine green tea maybe.) Can't wait to bring my parents here. Def would recommend visiting."

If you like Non-spicy savory noodle soups, Hakka Beef House is for you.\n\nThe triple meat (i.e. beef, brisket, and beef meatball) noodle soup was very delicious and came in a generous portion. The beef triple soup (without noodle) was nice. I think their soup base is not as MSG-heavy as a few other noodle/ramen places nearby, which is good.\n\nThe only thing we didn't like was the oil seasoning vegetables on the appetizer menu. The server said the dish was a boiled vegetables in a light sauce, but it turned out greasy in a bad way. Also, It came in a very small portion size (slightly more than the amount of vegetables in the noodle soup) while priced at $5.\n\nBottom line, Hakka Beef House has good noodles (or rice noodles) with decent authentic beef dishes (tripe, tendon, braised beef) as noodle toppings. Service is average in Chinatown.They just need to pay more attention to other non-staple dishes."

However if you're not feeling adventurous,  you should probably skip this because it does have beef stomach and pigs ear. Everything in platter was braised giving it beautiful flavors even without the sauce they provided.  \n\nThe noodles in the dishes were chewy and bouncy.

The hakka noodle soup I got looked as if I was served only half of the bowl.  It could have used more than 1 bokchoy and the small portion of beef and noodles.  My husband ordered Braised chopped pork dried noodle.  Flavor was decent but the portion again was tiny.  Also the egg served in the dish was still cold. We were not at all satisfied with our meal and came home and comforted ourselves with left over pizza from the night before."
