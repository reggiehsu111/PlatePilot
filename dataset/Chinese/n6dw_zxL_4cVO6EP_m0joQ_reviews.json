The proprietors are super, super, nice, and if you'd like some weird paperbacks, dvds, or costume jewelry with your food, theyve got you covered there too. Vegan tofu soup is 2.98/pint, 4.25/pt for veg lomein, 5 bucks for a pint of buddhas delight, and the other 10 veg options are 7.75. The quality is consistent and delicious, the sauces are tasty and the portions are good."
