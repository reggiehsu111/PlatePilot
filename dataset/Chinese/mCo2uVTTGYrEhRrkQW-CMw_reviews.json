Pretty good value, but not quite as good a value as Ting Wong, M Kee, Nan Zhou. \n\nSalt and pepper chicken wings- Very good, not quite as fried/crispy as other places' salt baked wings, but still good.\n\nScallion pancake- Very good. Fluffier than most places I usually have it. They serve it with a sweeter sauce. I think it tastes better with soy based sauces.\n\nTaiwanese beef noodle soup- Delicious. Very flavorful broth. Noodles are really good. My only complaint is that they should cut up the beef into smaller pieces. The beef portion in the soup is generous, but I'm trying to eat soup, not a steak.\n\nBeef chow fun- Pretty good, a little glutinous for my taste. I like the noodles a bit wetter in sauce. Beef portion is solid.\n\nService is fine and friendly. Their English isn't great, but it's fine. I did have to explain several times that I wanted the rest of my food wrapped up to go. This was a bit icky, but when they put my leftovers in, they included my chicken wing bones. I shouldn't have to specify that I dont want chewed chicken bones to go."

There was not enough sauce on top of it for a Taiwanese meat ball.\n\nThe chow fun was good. No complaints there.\n\nThe smoothie was terrible. Either the mango that they used was not ripe or they used mango juice instead of real fruit. 0/10, would not recommend."

Based on some of the reviews on here, I suggested we try Empress Garden for a late lunch. We were glad we did! We ordered the \"Family Dinner for 2\" with Hot and Sour soup; Sweet and Sour Chicken and Veggie Lo Mein. I am not a huge fan of Hot and Sour soup but my boyfriend is and he is very picky about it, but he loved it here! Even finished my bowl as well. The sweet and sour chicken was soooo good. Best I have ever had. It came with the sauce already on it and it was still nice and crispy. The lo mein was also above par and although we were too stuffed to finish it, the waitress gladly packed it up to go and we had a little snack for back at our hotel. If I am ever in Philly again, I will definitely be back to visit this restaurant."

My first reaction was, \"whoa, did I just find a stand-out Chinese restaurant that doesn't flood their dishes with sauce?\" For weeks, it was Chinese bliss. Every time I ate there I felt like I was being transported from Americanized sauce-drenched Chinese food to a place far, far, away, where sauce was hard to come by, and food only survived by the cooking virtues of its skilled chef. I was even getting ready to write a glowing review to that effect.\n\nIt all changed a few weeks ago, however. Not sure if the chef is on vacation, gone for good, or they received an extra large shipment of sauce. But all the positives I mentioned above reversed. My dishes were more akin to soups, even though they clearly were not in the soup section. I went back three more times, hoping against hope that the sauce flood would recede, but there was no such luck. I'm back on the hunt for *dry* Chinese dishes, but will keep hoping that the Empress goes back to being less saucy."

In fact I have recently given up vegetarianism for their beef noodle soup. I don't know how that happened but it did. This restaurant is run by the daughter of the owner of a chain of the same restaurants in Taiwan. All of the Taiwanese dishes are flavorful and truly unique to Taiwanese style of cooking. Highly recommend the scallion pancake, beef noodle soup, 3-cup/ flavor chicken, pot-stickers, Shanhaigh Won Ton Soup, and Taiwanese pork meat ball, and oyster pancake."

        "text": "A microcosm of Chinatown itself, Empress Garden is a staple for quick, quality Chinese food. Being that standard American only reaching so far within his comfort zone, I always go for the General Tso's, which is really great at Empress. The combination dinners on the back page offer this dish and many more with your choice of soup and rice for a very reasonable price (a little under $11). The Chicken and Broccoli and Sweet & Sour Chicken both look really good. As far as Wonton soup is concerned, it's the best I've ever had. \n\nDown 10th street just past the Friendship Arch sits Empress Garden, in all its simple glory, its dirty windows and plastic table covers - a recent addition that I think they should do away with. I'm sure it makes cleanup easier, but those thick plastic covers are a nuisance, in the way every time you cross your legs, sticky to the touch. Just take it from me, Empress, it's better without. \n\nThat note aside, Chinese food - as well all know - can be hit or miss. It's like Mexican restaurants that way: you'll eat it no matter what, but sometimes you raise an eyebrow as you do so. Also, it's a BYOB, which is a nice touch if you want to grab a bottle of wine or a couple beers beforehand. If you find yourself in Chinatown, find your way to Empress Garden, one of the gems of the area and maybe, just maybe, the best General Tso's I've ever tried."

Went today for lunch to get my favorite dish- Taiwanese beef noodle soup. This soup is the best; it certainly holds up against the stuff I've had in Taiwan. The noodles were a little thinner than I remember them, but they're fresh, and that really makes all the difference. For those who don't know Taiwanese beef noodle soup, the broth is supposed to be mildly spicy and salty, with a modest amount of chili oil and a hint of star-anise. The beef and tendons are pressure cooked to a nice tenderness, and absorb the broth well. The slight crunch of bean sprouts and sour of mustard greens fill out the texture and taste of the soup. My favorite."

The trio came with marinated tofu, pig ears and seaweed. the highlights were definitely the tofu and seaweed. the tofu had a fantastic savory marinade and was nice and firm. the seaweed was cut into ribbons and had an almost pasta like texture with a great salty briny flavor. I like pig ears but these were boring, and had nothing in the way of seasoning at all. I love the way Nan Zhou does pig ears, sliced super thin, marinated in sesame oil and chili, and served with pickled carrot and daikon. the peking noodles were a total home run however. a big bowl of noodles with a ground meat (pork I'm guessing) chili and tofu sauce. the noodles had a decent texture but were a little soft for my liking, however the meat sauce blew me away. it was filled with diced chilis which packed just enough heat to wake up your tastebuds but not destroy which is a good thing because there were so many of them that if they had been hot this dish would have been a nuclear bomb in your mouth. They were just right and cooked so they were still nice and crunchy and the flavor came through brilliantly in the sauce, which had a rich sweet gingery zing. This dish felt like a chinese version of spaghetti with meat sauce. Total comfort food. There was a good amount of sauce left over when I was finished with my noodles and I did not stop till my bowl was clean. The restaurant itself was nice and clean with friendly and fairly attentive staff, and even the americanized dishes looked well prepared and were not over priced. I will be returning soon, seriously I am thinking about those peking noodles right now."

Next thing we know a party of 10 walk in & guess what they get..... lunch special menus.  We were not given that menu or option to view it when we were seated.  Had I paid less for my mediocre food & service I might have not been so upset.  When we asked the waitress about why we were not given lunch menus she said \" you need to ask for it\".  Since when is it my job & not the waiters job to ask them about specials.  Any other place will inform you about special either for lunch or of that day.  I will not be going back here & I don't nor will I recommend it to anyone."

They are DELICIOUS... We also have ordered the Meatball and Peking Noodle with Meat Sauce... I have to say the noodle is as good as the beef soup noodle.\n\nBut the meatball is not as good as we expected it to be (actually, it is not really a meatball, it is some minced meat in some sticky bun). And one more flaw, we asked for the wifi password, but the staff said she didn't know. Emm, you work here and you don't know the password?!!\n\nBut for sure we will come back to try again :D"

Considering that it had been a month and a half since I last went there, it was a nice little extra. \n\nThe sweet and sour soup is absolutely delicious, very spicy, but the broth captures all the spices together. Mixed vegetables and rice were alright, but really how much of a twist can you take on that? They were fresh and the rice was fluffy, so there wasn't much to complain about.

I WISH they used shaved noodles to maximize the authenticity of being back in Asia; however, they do an excellent job. Additionally, things like the scallion pancakes and oyster pancakes were ABSOLUTELY some of the BEST I've ever had in Chinatown, hands-down.

First of all the service is excellent and most of the time quick. As for the food, everything is great! The scallion pancakes are a must for an appetizer. The way they make them is so crispy and pretty lite. Their smoothies are delicious and nutritious. From observation, the way they make their mango smoothie is they cut mangoes, add ice, and blend them together. The texture is thick and the taste is sweet. As for the entrees, Empress Garden never disappoints. The Indonesian rice or lo mien is recommended. The flavor is spicy and rich. In addition, the beef soup is tasteful. Even the Americanized Chinese dishes like General Tso's chicken are delightful. One of the best General Tso's chicken is my opinion. Another plus is that the portion size is reasonable for the price.

This place has been well established in Chinatown, with a great friendly owner. \n\nMust try:\n\n- Scallion Pancakes\nWarning: their sauce is a sweet vinegar base, not your typical soy sauce base. If you enjoy a zing and tangy flavor, this is up your alley) \n\n- Oyster Pancakes (topped with hoisin sauce) \nWarning: if you don't like the texture of oyster, don't get this. Why? Hm, what's a better way of saying this... the texture is \"slimy\". Yet, smooth and jello-like. Don't expect a typical pan-fried, crunchy, doughy scallion-like pancake. But if you enjoy oysters, this is to die for. \n \n- Taiwanese Beef Noodle: great for the price, large portion, and taste. A traditional favorite in Taiwan. \n\n- Braised Pork: pork belly. melt in your mouth. sweet soy sauce base. #whatishealthy?"

As expected, the dishes at Empress Garden are nowhere close to as good as the best spots in Taipei, but they at least have the right flavor profile.\n\nOyster pancake\nOut of all the dishes, this one was the best. The flavors, textures, and colors were on point. My one complaint is a big one: there weren't any whole oysters in the pancake.\n\nBeef noodle soup\nAlthough better than your standard Chinese beef noodle soup, the broth lacked depth. The beef was so tough I couldn't bring myself to eat it. The pickles were excellent. There were no tendons.\n\nWonton soup\nThe plump wontons were filled with pork, shrimp, and mushrooms. The wontons were served in a clear broth with seaweed and Chinese vegetables. Overall the dish was good, but the cook was a little heavy handed with the sesame oil. \n\nSpecial tofu and meatballs\nThis was on the Chinese side of the posted recommendations. The dish consists of tofu stuffed with meatballs and stewed. It looked and tasted very homemade in a bad way. The tofu had broken apart and the dish was overall bland.\n\nAlthough none of the dishes I had were perfect, I still have high hopes for my next visit. I plan on trying the pork chop rice and stewed trotters next!"

The Salt and Pepper chicken wings are awesome too. Nice and crispy, not greasy at all, and are tossed in a vinaigrette with cilantro and pepper slices. We also had the fried pork chop with rice. The pork chop was super crispy, cooked perfectly and had a beautiful subtle spice too it and it was absolutely not greasy at all. The Peking Noodles with meat sauce was very good too. I have to say, this is the hottest food (temperature wise) I have ever had at a restaurant. As soon as the food is cooked it's in front of you in seconds. I really like that!

The dishes here are a little salty for my own preference, but still very yummy.\n\nTip #1: price = portion size. \n\nI thought I might have need an extra appetizer, turns out I took half my meal home with me. I ordered the peking noodle with meat sauce for $6.75. It tastes a lot than it sounds. The portion size was bigger than my face. \n\nTip #2: Their Taiwanese meatball isn't the type of meatball you're use to. \n\nIt's actually a very tradition taiwanese dish, I was surprised to find it on the menu, I haven't been to many restaurants that sell it. Its sort of like a Chinese pork bun, except the outer layer is made up of tapioca flour and starch. It has interesting texture if you want to try it out. I for one thought it was pretty good.\n\nThe prices are actually a lot lower than I expected for a family style restaurant. Each large entree is around $10, at most $15. Noodles and rice dishes don't exceed $10. \n\nTo the point: I will definitely come here again!"

        "text": "This is a small restaurant. When we visited, we were the only fork-using, Caucasian people in the place. Judging by the other diners, I'm guessing this is fairly authentic cuisine that may appeal more to those who are familiar with it. We got the scallion pancakes which were very good. I'd go back just to order those. My brother had the crispy duck which he and my sister enjoyed. However, my sister ordered the three cup chicken that everyone here seems to like. We each tried one bite and then didn't eat any more of it. The taste was similar to turkey and gravy for me, and I liked the flavor. The problem is that it's basically just a bowl of meat and... other parts of the chicken. In order to get a bite of chicken, you have to separate it from the heavy layers of fat and the (cut) bones that are attached. If you don't succeed, you basically end up with a sharp bone in your cheek or a mouth full of fat. I'm a fan of lean, boneless meat myself so this was not appetizing for me. I had the sweet and sour pork. The coating was crisp and not too bready, but the pork inside was a little too chewy. I probably should have ordered the S&S chicken instead. I also like pineapple with my sweet and sour, but my plate came with a grand total of ONE pineapple chunk. The women working there were nice. The place seemed clean, but it isn't somewhere I'd take a date (vinyl tablecloths for one thing)."

Small details, but some places in Chinatown can be a dodgy about these things. The service was quick, pleasant and helpful, the waitress serving us gave me her recommendation on which smoothie was the best. The mango smoothie definitely was a highlight of the meal, the lo mein I ordered was satisfactory but I was most impressed with the smoothie and frozen watermelon ice. $3 each, which I think was quite reasonable. The smoothie was served in a cute glass, and it was really quite good, and I'm a bit picky about smoothies. (It wasn't one of those depressing smoothies filled with ice and disappointments)\n\nYes, there are places in Chinatown you could get food a bit cheaper (but really, not by much, it's quite reasonable), but I was quite pleased with the meal and the feel of the place. It's the kind of place you can take people to enjoy a more non-chain-restaurant feel of Philly without sacrificing cleanliness or nice/comfortable ambiance.

The broths in their soups is phenomenal. The shrimp with vegetables is perfection. The soup has shrimp of a good size, cooked right, and an assortment of veggies that are delightful. The beef broth is really great too. My only problem is an inability to finish it all. The guy and I have made it a habit to eat here before shows at the Troc, so I can never take a doggy bag. \n\nFood comes out to the table as it is prepared. Prices are completely reasonable. And credit cards are accepted."

I had asked them if they had \"Dan Bing\" and they looked at me like I wanted an enchilada. Back me up here, my fellow Taiwanese! But, they do have some dishes from Taiwan on the menu. With that settled, let's get to the good (and bad) stuff.\n\nDefinitely Order:\n+ Peking Noodle (Ja Jiang Mien) - This is the reason I love coming here. This is the Chinese version of Spaghetti alla Bolognese. Salty, sweet, spicy, crunchy bean sauce over thick Chinese noodles. The noodles are on the softer side (old school Asians don't believe in al dente) and mix very well with the sauce. \n+ Scallion Pancake - The best scallion pancake in the city. It's not thick like other places, and it's thin enough where it's not a cracker, either. The best part is the dipping sauce. Instead of the standard black vinegar mixture, the sauce is clear! I think it tastes better than its dark counterpart. \n+ Ma Po Tofu - I love ma po tofu. When I can't have my mom's, I come here for it.  \n\nMaybe Order:\n+ Taiwan Beef Noodle Soup - The noodle soup tastes pretty authentic, although it is on the blander side. \n+ Pai Goo Fan -  Fried pork chops w/ pickled veggies over rice. I like this one, but the pork chops need to be crispier.\n\nDon't Order:\n+ Soup Dumplings - Tastes like the frozen kind. There are other spots in town if you're craving these little exploding dumpling balls. \n+ Chinese-American Dishes - General Tso's chicken, beef and broccoli, orange chicken, and shrimp in lobster sauce? Umm... no. \n\nI just noticed that all of the dishes listed under \"Maybe\" are the Taiwanese dishes, weird. \n\nThe service, food, and prices at Empress Garden are great. Now if I can only find a place that makes Dan Bing...."

I'll refrain from further detail, but it was not a good scene. I contacted grubhub for nothing more than a refund, and they contacted the manager. The manager told them that without a copy of a hospital bill they would not honor any type of refund request. I tried calling the restaurant multiple times and the manager refused to speak with me. I will never order from them again and I recommend that you don't either if you'd like to stay in good health.

As is the Taiwanese meatball. This is really unusual, and unlike any other meatball or  dumpling. For $3.50 you get a ball made with a rice flour outer layer stuffed with mushrooms and pork. This is definitely one of the least attractive plates ever. \n\nAlso, try their Zha jiang mian. The dish is listed as Peking Noodles with Meat Sauce under the \"Northern China Style Noodle\" section of the menu. I found the Chinese version to be less salty and lighter, the Korean versions I have tried have more of a dark, hoisin  flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that the squishy noodles were home-made. They don't cheap out on the meat sauce, there is tons of the good stuff, but it manages to never overpower those noodles."

Beef noodle is of pretty good quality. The soup and the beef are tasty, but the noodle is not so good: it breaks easily and tastes too soft. The dumplings, well I can have dumplings of that quality at any food truck around Philly. \nMaybe there are other things I can order that taste better.

The chicken was INSANELY flavorful and was probably our favorite thing. There are small bones so be careful, but the meat is so soft and full of savory, garlicky goodness it was hard to put down.

The original owner (the \"Empress\"), was a sterling hostess and stunning beauty who ran her house efficiently and with admirable warmth.  The food had a Taiwanese and Indonesian orientation, but also had the standard American/Chinese dishes for those who preferred them.  Their fruit drinks were freshly squeezed, and it had a strong following. \n\nI returned after an absence of a few years, and my first run with the new operation.  While the menu was basically the same as before, the actual plates coming from the kitchen seemed to have lost a bit of their edge.  We ordered Scallion Pancakes, Curry Chicken with Onions, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, Orange Beef and Saut\u00e9ed String Beans.  A lot for the three of us to consume, but we were looking forward to bring the balance home.  \n\nWhile the Scallion Pancakes were good, they are certainly returned to the norm, and were not as exceptional as remembered.  The Chicken dish had the right taste and fresh chicken, but the Onions were harder than desired, and thus tended to dominate the dish.  The S & P Pork Chops had been a wonderful platter in the past, but this day the breading and meat was over-deep fried, making it tougher in the bite, and less enjoyable in the chew.  Disappointing.  The Orange Beef was the best thing on our table, with a nice spicy, not overly gloopy, sauce.  It was fun to eat even with the orange peel in its soft non-burnt condition.  Finally, the Veggies were fine with a light Garlic finish.  \n\nThe meal was satisfactory, but not what I hoped for based on recollection.  Empress Garden was now just another Chinatown restaurant with a fair kitchen and price, but nothing to make it outstanding."

The tea was cold, my shrimp with walnuts was heavily breaded and partially cold, the rice was lukewarm with burned portions possibly from the bottom of the pot. My husband had pork with black bean sauce which was fine and warm. \nDuring the meal the staff stood just out of the main dining area and talked loudly the entire time we were eating. It was distracting, unpleasant and less than helpful. The restaurant was empty so it's not like they were overloaded with customers. Not sure where 4 stars came from but it does not reflect on our experience. It's been a long time since we've had such a poor meal."

The online ordering system itself is seamless, and supposedly your food gets delivered from some service called Dining In Philadelphia or delivery.com. Now I've never ordered food from this restaurant and this delivery service and its vague names seemed a little sketchy, but we were hungry.  We ordered ma po tofu and chicken for delivery at 6:45pm. At 8:00pm, I called the number in the email confirmation to check on the order. The number led to a voicemail system for the administrative office of the delivery service (under yet another vague name). Hmmm. So I called the restaurant and reached a lady who yelled, \"You pick up!!\" a bunch of times as I tried to inquire about our food order. Then she hung up on me. Then I called some other number in the confirmation email and reached an actually very nice lady who kept me on hold for a while as she tried to call the restaurant (probably got yelled at), and then finally returned to my call and cancelled the order. Fine. It was about 8:30 at this point. We made quesadillas and went to sleep. 9:30pm.... Phone rings repeatedly. It's the delivery guy! He's outside! Almost 3 hours after we ordered! I tell him we ordered hours ago and had since cancelled the order. He is dismayed and says no one told him. A few minutes later he calls back and says he talked to someone and we can have the food anyway. I said thanks but we ate already."

So we thought, let's give it a shot. The place looks unappealing from outside but if you're looking for good authentic Chinese food, this is the place to be. It's clean and small, so large party is not recommended. \n\nWe are not sure what to order since we don't speak nor read Chinese at all. We also don't want to eat just an ordinary American Chinese food. The waitress: Ida is Indonesian. lucky me, so she recommend me the good authentic food over there. She's also great with my American friend and speak English very well. \n\nMy favorite so far is shredded beef with tofu and bamboo shoot, the fried noodle (there're many kinds of them, ask them to recommend you, all of them that i tried were good), the noodle like Dave H recommended (note: it's C62 in the menu not C71, although C71 is also good). We took home the Taiwanese beef noodle soup and wasn't too impressed, so we may have to eat there. The chicken in the hot pot is also delicious. \n\nIf you want authentic Chinese food, ask them to recommend you, don't go by the menu because the English menu is pretty much American standard Chinese food. \n\nThe price is also very good as it ranges from $6.95 to $8.95. I haven't tried their fish but I will next time I go there with more friends (not just the two of us). \n\nOoh and the fruit juice is to die for. It's very good,fresh and big tall glass only cost $2.95."

Waaaaay toooooo salty! Not spicy at all. It was inedible. It was \"house recommended\" but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. \n\nFish ball soup - 3\nSmall boiled white fish balls. Compared to the other food I had here, this is edible. \n\nMa Po Tofu - 2\nThis dish was supposed to be \"house recommended\" and this restaurant's \"special\" dish as it is written up on their chalkboard but there was barely any taste to it. It wasn't spicy at all. \n\nBeef & Beans - 1 \nAwfully salty! It tastes like they soak them in salt and served it like that. \n\n3 Bui Gai (Chicken) - 1 \nThis is also \"house recommended,\" this restaurant's \"special\" dish, and a traditional Taiwanese dish. This is a Taiwanese cuisine restaurant so we expected it to be good. Not only did it not meet our expectation, it tasted awful! It was plain SALTY! So bad! It's like they didn't mix it well, one chicken was super sweet, the other was ridiculously salty. \n\nGon Chow Au Hor (Dry fried stirred flat noodles) - 2\nIt was bland. Didn't taste like anything but since we had so much salty food, this was saving my life. \n\nI feel bad but I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.

The staff that work there are average and the food is average. The portions are a good size both times I've been here.  We ordered the sweet and sour chicken and as an appetizer the scallion pancakes.\n\nThe scallion pancakes came out first so that was good, it comes with a sauce which compliments the dish. The sweet and sour chicken was average, nothing to rave out. They deep fry the chicken and the sauce is a little bit to thick for my own choosing but to each it's own.  They give you free tea and water which is cool. \n\nThe staff could've been a bit more attentive. They also seem disorganized a little bit. We had three different people come to our table to give us food or clean up our dishes. The gentlemen that works there I feel was the most professional out of the three. The prices for food is ok and I would come back here again in the future.\n\nThe dining area is a bit small but it works so not a deal breaker. There's only one bathroom I believe so that could be an issue for some. They greeted us upon walking in and we were seated immediately. Overall I gave it 3.0 stars out of 5.0. I think the service needs to improve for sure."

I'm Taiwanese and grew up eating my mom's Taiwanese cooking, and this place was kind of disappointing. I guess it's semi-authentic, but that doesn't mean it's GOOD. I don't really get these glowing reviews. \n\nThe beef noodle soup was fine but average. Nowhere near the best I've had. The pork chops over rice (pai gu fan) were also fine I suppose. The food in general was just okay. \n\nAlso, my dining companion swears he saw bugs. Plural. Like, on the table AND on the floor. I don't mind a little dirtiness in a Chinese restaurant, but multiple roach-like bugs in the dining area are unacceptable. \n\nIf you're looking for decent Taiwanese food around Philly, Han Dynasty is actually Taiwanese-owned and offers a selection of authentic Taiwanese dishes out at their suburban locations."

So I get to the restaurant, its small like most other chinatown restaurants in philly, but luckily I didnt have to wait to get seated.  I ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, (they have another item on the menu that is beef noodle soup with vegetables, which is not what i got ).  The bowl that it came in was decently sized, not too big, not too small.  The broth was smooth and not too salty.  I would have liked more star of anis flavor, but this satisfied my craving nonetheless.  The sour lettuce, was a bit much for me, maybe put in half the amount that was given to me.  There was also specks of other vegetables like ginger, onion, etc.  The noodles themselves were very good, chewy, soft, probably home made although i cant confirm that after only one visit.  \n\nOverall i would definitely return to this small joint, and order the same thing.  This is one of the better beef noodle soups Ive had and I'm lucky yelp pointed me in the right direction."

Great portion, doesn't go overboard on the star anise.  Actually, the Beef Noodle Soup here is better than most I have tried in NYC's Chinatown. \n- Porkchops over rice (Paigu fan) - these porkchops are perfectly seasoned with that five spice powder and the juicy suckers are fried in a super crispy batter and fried to perfection. \n- Jia Jian Mien (the homestyle noodles with the black bean sauce) - what I love about these noodles here is that there are plenty of bits of meat and it is saucy.  I hate it when you go to places and there is not enough meat.  And it's got some sprouts in there to give it that nice wet crunch.\n- Mah Wan (massive Taiwanese vegetable dumpling?) I don't know what it is in english, but it is made of that glutinous rice and inside it is filled with assorted Taiwanese veggies and it has that pink/red sauce on it.  When I was growing up, I always called it a jellyfish, but it really has nothing to do with a jellyfish, it just kind of looks like one. The one here is GREAT.  No tuff spots in the dough.  The sauce is the perfect consistency and has great flavor and tang. Not overly sweet like some places.\n- Scallion pancakes:  the ones here are crisp and thin and comes with the seasoned dipping sauce.  Delicious!\n\nService is super friendly.

This is one of the few Taiwanese restaurants in Chinatown.  It has a very clean feel and one of the walls is a huge glass window that looks out onto 10th street, so there's plenty of natural light and sunshine.\n\nI tried the Taiwanese beef noodle soup.  Just under 7 bucks, steaming hot, a very generous amount of beef, and very flavorful.  (Maybe a little too flavorful actually, I found the broth a teeny bit on the salty side)  I wouldn't have minded a little more of the veggies but still a great portion size for the price; I had leftovers for later.  My friend tried the Indonesian curry and really enjoyed it.  The curry itself was a little on the watery side, but we weren't sure if that's the nature of Indonesian curry itself or how it was prepared here.  \n\nBest to avoid ordering from the lunch special menu even though those items, like General Tsao's, may sound more familiar to those who don't know a whole lot about Taiwanese cuisine, b/c those are distinctly Americanized dishes. In fact, my friend was originally going to order the Hunan chicken lunch special and the waitress actually asked if she was sure, adding that those are Americanized dishes.  \n\nObviously if you know Chinese, now's the time to bust it out with the waitresses but they speak English really well too, at least from the exchange I heard between the waitress and an English-speaking patron.  \n\nI already have my eye on the pork chops with rice (sounds fatty but heavenly) for my next trip here, and sometime I'll try the oyster pancake appetizer too.\n\nThe only drawback, which is a minor one, is that there's only a single restroom and it looks like a broom closet converted to a bathroom b/c it's so narrow. Really, I don't know how people with a slightly larger body habitus would squeeze into this, and the sink is tiny.

We had a conversation on what was tasty and she ultimately recommended a Taiwanese noodle dish (C71 on the menu) to me, which I ordered to go. I mentioned that I've never been in her restaurant before, so when she said it was 24 years old, I was floored!\n\nMy dish of \"spicy\" (they weren't really spicy), dry Taiwanese noodles set me back $6.75, but kept me fed for hours. It was a generous portion of shredded string beans, salty soybeans, tofu, pepper flakes, pork (meat), bean sprouts, and white noodles. Did I mention it came out right away? Worth a try, stop in!"

As soon as Empress Garden came into mind I put my mind to ordering the Taiwanese beef noodle soup. The beef broth with the pickled veggies is so delicious with soft noodles. I also love the zajiangmian (Peiking noodles with meat sauce) which comes with crunchy string beans and tofu and ground meat. It's a bit spicy too :)\nWe also got the string beans which is perfectly crunchy - not soggy or burnt.\nThe service is always good and ever since they changed owners they have remodeled the place so it's more spacious than before.\nI've also had their pork chops which are yummy. Their duck is decent too.\nAlso, come for their other taiwanese specialties such as the oyster pancake, yum!"

In addition, we ordered Jia Jia Mian (Peking Noodle with Meat Sauce), Braised Pork Feet over Rice and some Hunan Chicken. Each dish was yummy, dish sizes and prices are great. Plus, the kitchen works very fast.\n\nIn general, I have the feeling that this restaurant's dishes are a mixture of westernized Chinese and authentic Chinese cuisine which is not bad at all! :) Just don't be surprised of the food preparation/layout, as we were. Definitely worth a stop."

Someone else at the  table had an allergy of a garnish of a soup dish, he asked the wait staff if they could make the dish without the garnish.they said yes, and the dish came out with the garnish on it. The restaurant itsself was small and dirty. I ate nothing, and went to mcdonalds across the street for my edible food. NEVER AGAIN!!"

This was the first time I've eaten Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but it gave me the same feeling as a good bowl of pho. \n\nI've passed by Empress Garden so many times while in Chinatown, but I finally decided to try it one cold night. Inside, it looks and is small, and what you see in the window is basically it. \n\nThe Taiwanese beef noodle soup broth's was cloudy, the noodles were soft, and the beef was tender. The pickled collard greens was a surprising topping that added an interesting flavor to the savory soup. \n\nThe spice must have been an oil because only the first few bites from the top were spicy, so I added some of the chili oil from the table. This was a whole other flavor which if you decide to try out Empress Garden, definitely try the chili oil."

They do have some more traditional Chinese entrees, as well, but I'd recommend trying some of the less common items if you go.  I've been several times, and have sampled the fried pork chop (really good), the meatball (a gelatinous rice ball with meat inside, and a tomato sauce on top) and a few of their soups and noodle dishes, which were all very good.  It's a nice place to go with an adventurous foodie group to try some new dishes that may be less common that what you'd find in Chinatown."

        "text": "We visited Empress Garden on spring Saturday afternoon around 18.00 Hrs. The place was clean and had a moderate crowd. We were quickly seated and our server brought out tea and iced water almost immediately. Our server then disappeared for 15-20 minutes before taking our order. We then waited ten minutes for our soups to arrive. I found the hot and sour soup to only match its name in one adjective: the temperature was hot. The soup had a very thick consistency and very oily. The soup was rather bland with no flavor. My dining companions agreed that their wonton soup also was oily and bland and one remarked he thought the meat in his was \"off\" which he did report to the server. We only consumed about half of our soups before pushing them away.\n\n   Our server removed the half consumed soup and listened to the report of bd meat in the wonton. Fifteen minutes later she brought out our main courses. I ordered the General Tso's chicken with a vegetable roll, our server said the substitution was no problem, as I have a seafood allergy. My companions also ordered a General Tso's and sweet and sour chicken, all with shrimp rolls. \n\n   I found my General Tso's also to be rather bland: the sauce was sweet but no \"kick\" or orange flavor to it. My companions stated the sweet and sour chicken was okay but nothing rave about. They also agreed that the General Tso's was bland and uninteresting. The final straw was when one of the companions consumed their shrimp roll only to find out it was my vegetable roll. I'm glad I didn't immediately bite in to my egg roll as I did not have my Epipen with me and spending a Saturday night in the emergency room is not fun.\n\n   We chose the Empress Garden based upon Yelp reviews so maybe we got an off night or the place is not consistent. Either way we won't be going back."

        "text": "I was in the mood for fried rice. There are many options in the area but I decided on Empress Garden based on reviewer comments and pictures.  \n\nThe store front was very hole-in-the-wall which is fine with me because I tend to have better experiences with small places as opposed to hyped-up elaborate establishments.\n\nI walked in and was greeted by an employee who offered me a table but I said I would like to make a to-go order and he quickly gave me a menu and asked if I had any questions.  I placed my to-go order of pork fried rice extra spicy with extra veggies.  The price was surprisingly low so I made sure to clarify that I was charged correctly for the full order and not half or lunch portion and he confirmed that the full order is correctly around $7.\n\nI helped myself to a seat as I waited.  The dining area is small, perhaps 10 to 12 tables and there were no other customers present but I was there in the middle afternoon on Tuesday.\n\nMy to-go order was ready in 5 minutes.  The rice was packed in a typical styrofoam food box put into a plastic shopping bag along with chopsticks and a plastic fork and spoon.  It did not include soy sauce, hot mustard, etc so keep that in mind if you like to put soy sauce on your food.\n\nThe fried rice was pretty good.  It was a bit dry but I contribute that to the fact that I took it to-go and reheated it.  There were hardly any veggies despite me asking for extra veggies but the meal was still good.  The flavor was good and the spice level was noticeable but not what I would consider hot.  I prefer the larger chunks of pork in fried rice but this one had those smaller bits of chewy pork that are perhaps the size of peas.  There was a generous portion of pork which was very satisfying.\n\nOverall, I rate this place as pretty good.  I am satisfied with my fried rice meal.  The menu had other dishes that looked very good so I would be happy to eat here again if I had the opportunity."

Being Taiwanese, I feel that real Taiwanese offerings are pretty scarce in Philadelphia (hint hint, someone open up a new Taiwanese joint already sheesh!). Sometimes I crave the food that you can just pick up from some random street cart in Taipei. Anyway, so I scoured the internet for Taiwanese places in Philadelphia, and if anyone has another suggestion for one, please let me know. That's how I stumbled across Empress Garden a couple years ago. I've been going fairly regularly since.\n\nThey've recently remodeled, and the restaurant actually looks much nicer (although I was sad when they were closed for remodeling). There are a few staples I always get:\n\n- Scallion pancakes - Even though the ones here aren't really super authentic, they're just really good! They're deep fried, and that fish and vinegar sauce it comes with is really good. I usually get two orders, and if I'm sharing with friends I secretly hog it. \n\n- 3 Cups Chicken - This dish should have the bone in (for flavor), basil, ginger, and that sweet sticky soy sauce. This is really quite addicting. The flavors are perfect in combination.\n\n- Fried pork chop - The ones here are very juicy and have a crispy outside. \n\n- Jah Jang Mein - It's Taiwanese style, so for the Koreans out there, don't expect zucchini and black tarry sauce. It's savory, meaty, flavorful, and really hits the spot. I'm not sure if the noodles are house made, but they definitely have that chewy spring to them (for those who know what I'm talking about, very \"Q\").\n\n- Beef noodle soup - This also has that authentic Taiwanese developed flavor. Again, the noodles are so good here.\n\nThey also do offer a lot of Taiwanese street foods including oyster pancake, Taiwanese meatball with glutinous rice wrap (\"bah wan\"), and other tasty offerings.\n\nFinally, if you don't speak Chinese, can't read it, or don't have a Chinese friend to bring with you to the restaurant, choose something off the above list. There are 2 menus here, the English menu and the Chinese menu (which has more of the authentic tasty food). I would hate for you to come here and end up with General Tso's chicken."

I didn't know why this dish was called that and so I looked it up and apparently it's because you make it with 1 cup of rice wine, 1 cup of sesame oil and 1 cup of soy sauce. Out of the three dishes we had, this one was the most difficult to eat because of all the chicken bones.\n\nThis is one of my all time favorite dishes, eggplant with ground pork in garlic sauce.  Even when I got the to go bag, I could smell the eggplant dish beckoning me to the back seat. My boyfriend wasn't too pleased that I had killed the new car smell with Chinese food. Oh well!"

My parents grew up in Taiwan and even they commented on how impressed they were with every dish.\nWe ordered the Taiwanese beef noodle soup, oyster pancake, triple stir fried, salt and pepper pork chop, and beef chow fun. Highly recommend the beef noodle soup- so many tender chunks of meat, substantial noodles, and the broth was flavourful with the right amount of spicy. The salt and pepper pork chop was delicious, perfectly crispy and savoury. Beef chow fun was standard, and we also finished the triple stir fried and oyster pancake in no time.\nSide note: we were seated next to a table of foreigners that ordered fried rice and wonton/egg drop soup and it truly saddened my soul to know they were missing out on the real winning dishes. \nDefinitely stop by here next time you're in Chinatown!"

The Cantonese owners said they have the same cooks, but you could clearly taste the difference between the current and previous food. The oyster omlete was watery and had a strong fishy taste and the fried pork chop was battered diffently that left a bad taste in my mouth. Unfortunately, there aren't any Taiwanese restaurants in the region that serve this type of food."

From the outside, this doesn't look like much but it is a treasure trove of authentic Taiwanese dishes that are simply too die for (or at least worth the Chinatown parking charge and rush hour traffic on the good ole I-76).  The Taiwanese beef noodle soup is the most popular dish, and is well deserving of its reputation.  Perfect on a cold day.  Also be sure to try the pork chops with the Shanghainese rice  cakes.  The basil/three cup chicken is pretty good.  Just stay away from takeout dishes because those tend to be well, takeout-like, for lack of a more precise description.  If you're in Chinatown, you need to stop by.  My family has been coming here for the past 17 years, and it is still one of our favorite restaurants.  I've brought friends from school here and even the Californians find this place to be authentic.  That, too me at least, says a lot."

The restaurant can be easy to miss as its surrounded by a plethora of bakeries and other restaurants in the heart of Chinatown but don't sleep on this place!\n\nGot the traditional Taiwanese pork chop, Taiwanese noodle, and the pork and mustard greens sour soup. As my friend pointed out, although the beef noodle soup is the most popular of Taiwanese dishes this sour mustard green pork soup is a little known traditional delight and actually sold at very few restaurants. However, it was delicious and a lot lighter than most beef based soups. Definitely great for a hot day add a huge portion for less than $7 per bowl. Same with the pork chop, which was tender in the center with a crispy, seasoned crust. \n\nFinally, the stereotype with a lot of cheap Chinese restaurants in Chinatown is the poor service but that couldn't be further from the case here! The lady who served us was so kind and warm and I liked that they played Chinese music in the background - really gave it that authentic feel haha. Would recommend, come and eat here!"
