I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I'm biased, because I love the service here. They've always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han's sister?). I've been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I've been to the other.\n\nNote though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn't so good (I wouldn't know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.\n\nNext, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it's a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3."

        "text": "I waited a long time to finally try this place and I have to say I was let down a bit. I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.\n\nThe service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I'm sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more."

        "text": "Ok. I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn't they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like \"why are you here. I have better things to do\"?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just \"Hey man, what can I get ya?\"  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, \"We don't want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?\". The manager says \"Sure.\" The guy then says, \"Can we get few beers down here\"? (paraphrasing). The bartender says \"Sure!\" and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, \"Hey, just shout and I will get you something\", or \"Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you\". Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! \n\nLong story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it's different."

It's \"family style\" which means they bring each dish out as soon as it's ready and you're supposed to share. And when they say \"as soon as it's ready\" they mean within 5 minutes of your order. We were amazed at how fast the food came out, and our server was extremely nice and helpful. The menu also has helpful numbers to indicate how spicy each dish is going to be. \nWe had a few different dishes for the table, and polished them all off, because we loved almost everything we ordered. \nThis place is really a tremendous dining experience."

The menu selection and service were excellent, and Megan helped us create a custom menu to mix authentic Chinese and kosher styles, while also incorporating plenty of items for vegetarian and other dietary restrictions. The restaurant comfortably seated 80+ people in their side area with constant, friendly service the whole night. In spite of some misunderstandings on menu totals and pricing, Megan was very patient and accommodating and helped us sort everything out. At the end of the night, our family and friends loved the food and everyone had a great time.\n\nI highly recommend the Han Dynasty to anyone for great food, service, and events coordinating!"

        "text": "Han Dynasty is one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.  I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.\n\nEventually I tried the University City location, and it's much more \"hip.\"  I really don't care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.\n\nHan Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It's most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.\n\nOn their \"specials\" menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.\n\nThey have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It's really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn't the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it's all flavor.  \n\nDry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.\n\nSeveral reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It's just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  \n\nAbsolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!"

        "text": "Couple of notable impressions:\n\n- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.\n\n- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don't consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I'm more so than I think?\n\n- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.\n\n- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can't remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.\n\n- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it's may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that's something you'd like.\n\nEDIT:\n\n- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.\n\n- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice."

For what is expected of Chinese food, it is on the pricier side, but all well worth it.  My favorite recommendations include Dan Dan noodles, Dry Pepper Chicken/Shrimp, and Cumin Lamb.  The service can be slow during busier days such as Friday/Saturday/Sunday, but the waiters/waitresses are very friendly making the wait forgivable."

I really enjoyed the appetizers (dumplings in chili oil) and the entree (garlic chicken).  I know, I know, I was looking for noodles and ended up without.  I think this was mostly because as I was looking at the menu, plates kept going by me, steaming of fresh, Chinese wok flavors. I couldn't resist but to try a little of this and a little of that.\n\nMeal was hot, fresh, flavorful and an excellent recommendation.\n\nOn a down side, as I have noticed on this trip, the customer service, servers, waiters don't seem too excited to be working.  They seem tired, uninterested and could care less of your/my experience.  Maybe this is normal in Philly?"

I had the Cumin Pork spiced to level 10 my friend had chicken fried rice. We like very hot food most places even in DC cannot get the balance of heat and flavor right even when dishes are request extra spicy. Han Dynasty did!!

I am writing this review even before I head to the restaurant for dinner tonight and believe me when I say this, that I would never end up eating here if the majority of the birthday girl's party did not insist on eating at Han Dynasty just because she likes the food.\u00a0\n\n\nIt takes 2 phone calls and talking to 3 people to get a reservation at this restaurant, that itself is a turn off. The first lady I speak to is flat out rude when I call asking to make a dinner reservation for tonight \"We're all booked for tonight and not giving out any reservations\" she says before hanging up on me. I call back and a second lady answers and I say I need a reservation for 15 people at 9:30 and she asks for how long? WTF??? \"For however long it takes 15 adults to get done with dinner that's how long\" She responds saying they close at 10PM and the lady has no clue what day it is and they are open later on Friday's and finally agrees to give me a reservation.\u00a0\n\n\nIt is absolutely appalling when people working in the hospitality industry are rude. If you can't be courteous to your guests consider a different profession. I understand you are in the university city area and have to, more often that you like, deal with students but that by no means is an excuse for ill-treating your guests.\u00a0\n\n\nIf you expect a 20% tip from anyone they expect to be given a good experience right from the time they call you to make a reservation."

At first, I was a little worried because I'm not a fan of spicy food and I was told that Sichuan cuisine differs a little from the Chinese cuisine most people might be accustomed to but I loved it.  We had a waiter who was Chinese who gave us a lot of good information and was able to alter some dishes for us so for those who do not like their dishes too spicy or can't handle a lot of heat, do not worry, because it seems as though they can alter the spiciness to most of their dishes.  We were told which dishes that they were known for and which dishes are \"traditional\" so we tried the Dan Dan Noodles with less spice and it was delicious!  We were also recommended the Double Cooked Pork Belly, which is something I don't usually like because it's kind of fatty, but it turned out to be great as well.  They also have a cool little happy hour with some cheaper drinks so it's cool to get there a little before dinner, like we did and enjoy some cheaper drinks before dinner.  I wish they had some light beer available since I'm a girl and I'd like to have some lower calorie/lighter options for beer, but it's okay since they have a good wine selection too so I just chose to go with wine.

It's a bit of a chain restaurant, albeit a small chain, but there are enough locations for me to question how great the food could be across the board. \n\nThe University City location is a few steps away from my office, so I finally decided to try it today for lunch. They offer a decent selection of entrees as part of a lunch special, which prices options between $8.50 - $10.  I was told the lunch special portion size is smaller than you'd get if you purchased a regular entree, but there was more than enough food for me.  I'm still very full 2 hours later. \n\nI had lunch alone today, so I sat at the bar and they offered complementary water and tea. I also took a look at their draft menu, which had a nice selection of craft brews.  They also offer a decent amount of bottled beer, cocktails, wine, etc. They definitely don't skimp in the bar offerings.\n\nFor lunch I had the Garlic Sauce Chicken, which came with rice on the side.  It came out really quickly, definitely less than 10 minutes after ordering.  This surprised me, and not necessarily in a good way, I immediately questioned how good it could be if it was cooked and brought out so quickly. However, my fears immediately went away with the first bite. The food was hot and delicious. I don't think Han Dynasty is trying to offer truly authentic Chinese food, this seemed like an American Chinese dish. That didn't matter though, the food was great and 100% better than any of the surrounding University City Chinese food restaurants and trucks that I've eaten at.  Han Dynasty might be a few dollars more for lunch, but the taste and quantity makes it worthwhile. \n\nI'll definitely be back with a group to try out their dinner service."

The noodles were very delicious with the pork and sauce all mixed in. The pork hot sauce style was just as good, especially with the complimentary rice (by the way, you can ask for more rice if you run out, and it won't cost you more). It was nice and spicy, but you could also adjust the spice, so there's something for everyone. I would give the noodles a 4.5/5 and the pork a 4/5 (it was a little too oily, but that's just my personal taste). \n\nIn addition, they give you tea free of charge! I had always thought that was expected in Chinese restaurants, especially based on my experiences, but it seems that in some Chinese restaurants on the east coast, they charge for tea. So I was very happy to see that I had nice, light tea to complement my food. I left feeling extremely full. Lastly, the atmosphere is really nice, fit for a casual lunch or dinner or a nicer one."

I thought from the look of the outside that it was going to be a PF Changs kind of deal, which is a big NOPE for me. If that's your bag, cool, but I prefer more authentic when I can get it. However, at the voice of a friend, I decided to give it a try. \n\nI got the pork belly double-cooked style, and the taiwanese sausage. The sausage is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, the sweet sausage that you find at Asian groceries, but paired with freshly sliced garlic which took it to another level.\n\nThe pork belly was a little drier than I expected. It didn't have exactly the melt in my mouth texture that I tend to associate with pork belly. The sauce, though a little oily, was flavorful and complex. They rated the spice at a four, but honestly I found it pretty mild. I would've put it more at a one or a two.\n\nDespite those few minor nitpicks, this is definitely a place I intend to bring my husband back to to try more things. Maybe next time I'll try the rabbit."

I've had several other dishes, all adjusted to level 6 or 7 and I really haven't been disappointed ever. (Specifically, I have had the scallion style, hot sauce style, and crispy rice. But seriously, if you can't deal with hot food, this is not the place for you.)\n\nThe only thing I've had that I am not a fan of the cumin dish - my boyfriend LOVES it, but it's really dry and powdery to me. \n\nOn the specials menu, the curry is seriously some of the best food I've ever had.

The only gap was about 15 minutes between appetizers and main courses. \n\nThe Dan Dan noodles was not the sesame paste type that I am used to, but a more beefy noodle and spicy type.

The menu here is also much wider than the menu in the NYC branch.\n\nI really recommend the spicy crispy cucumbers to start and the dry pepper fish, although to be honest I haven't gotten a dish here that I haven't liked.\n\nIf you're not a huge fan of spicy food, you probably won't like Han Dynasty; their 'spice scale' is also not very accurate at all, as there are some level 10 dishes that are barely spicy."

I was hesitant about the family style at first, but am pleasantly surprised with the portion-size. Our waiter, Anthony, is extremely helpful and knowledgeable and provided with very good service. \nI agree with the reviews that say to order one less dish than the party size. I went with a party of 7 around 7:00, and we haven't eaten anything all day. We order 7 dishes and were stuffed by the end and even had leftovers. \nI was expecting a relatively large bill but the final cost is less than what we estimated per person. \nNot everyone in my party eats spicy food, so we got mild (around 2 or 3 stars) for most dishes, and everyone seems to be okay with that level. Rice is included with the entrees and there are free refills which is helpful in helping wash the spiciness down. Our table really enjoy the Beef & Tripe in Chili Oil even though we kept it at 10 stars.

It reminded me of a Mongolian grill, but your sitting down, not watching, there are more options, and it's not Mongolian.\n\nThe prices are a little high, considering how inexpensive good Chinese food can be. And, for someone not familiar, it's not so easy to know what many of these dishes taste like.\n\nI ordered the 3 chicken. It was good, though the chicken was about as soft as chicken can be, almost doughy. And, it was not breaded! Weird, I know. Anyway, it tasted good, but lacked any veggies. A friend pointed out that since the set-up is family style, that it might work better if mixed with a veggie dish.\n\nThe hottest dish anyone got was a 5, and I am told that was pretty spicy.

But after going through this ordeal, I probably should be.\n\nBefore I go on my rant, I'd just like to credit waiters like Kevin and the manager ( bald guy) who were phenomenal because they actually do their jobs and build personal relationships with new customers even when they aren't my servers, and therefore have no incentive for doing so. That is not just customer service, it shows great personal character as well. Because I could do nothing for them as far as tips, but they were still helpful anyway.\n\nHowever, I seldom get Kevin and I ALWAYS get the increasingly incompetent women waitresses who don't do their jobs correctly and that is what destroyed the whole Han Dynasty experience for me. \n\nEvery time I come in, the place is not that busy at all, so there shouldn't be any excuses for any customer mistreatment. For example I was there the other day, one of only three people in the dining room during lunch, my water was never filled, and I had to get up out of my seat to ask someone else for extra rice because she never came back to see how I was doing. I even had to get back up to ask her ( the white, slinky waitress ) to bring my check. When she gave me my check she didn't come back for 20 minutes. She wasn't even busy, she was counting her tips about 5 tables away from me. Kevin saw this neglect and processed my payment for me. I wanted to tip Kevin. I should have put zero dollars on the tip but I felt guilty.\n\nI actually just started coming here, and I have been buying food for the past couple weeks, both takeout and eat-in. No more. \n\nThe dishes aren't difficult to make; pork belly appetizer, and dry pepper fish can be made at home. I will be going to China Town today to buy my ingredients instead of dealing with the crappy hospitality that the waitresses provide.\n\nOverall, the experience is ZERO Stars.\n\nFood, however, is phenomenal.

Offered to groups of 8 or larger, this fixed-price-per-person option brings out a plethora of dishes that can be highly customized to the needs/wants of the group (vegetarians, food allergies, spice preferences, etc).  Rather than deliberating between an order of noodles and entree, you can have both (and probably 6-8 other dishes besides). And don't be wary about the sharing component as the portions are large. The wait staff even kindly packaged up the portions left on the lazy Susan before the next round began. As always, they give a quick and obviously rehearsed description of the dish (cheesy but appreciated nonetheless) when they bring it to your table.\n\nSome must haves for the tasting menu-Spicy cucumbers, cold sesame noodles, and hot sauce style *insert protein of choice here*.\n\nSince its a popular venue, it can never hurt making a reservation."

I've been craving Chinese for a while, and this more than satisfied my cravings in a way that cheap fast-food take-out never could.\n\nThe food is arranged by how hot and spicy it is, from a 1 (not hot) to a 10 (mouth on fire).  My group chose what we thought would be a fairly safe, not spicy level of 3--and found ourselves unprepared for the peppers.  Next time I'll go for a 1, but I'll definitely go back.\n\nWe had a tasting menu which included a huge variety of dishes.  Appetizers ranged from scallion pancakes (flakey and buttery goodness!), to pork dumplings (mouth on fire burning!), a cucumber salad, pork lo mein, and other savory/spicy dishes.  By the time the entrees arrived, most everyone at my table was more than halfway to being full, but the array of foods to sample was enough to entice us to continue eating.  The sweet honey-batter shrimp, snow-pea leaves, stir-fried green beans with pork and chicken with sticky rice were all amazing.  The meats were well marinated and practically melted in my mouth (beef, pork, chicken--all were excellently prepared!).  The vegetables were crisp and the sauces tangy.  It was an excellent meal, only dimmed by the fact that this place doesn't serve dessert! (As I live for sugar, I find this somewhat blasphemous)\n\nWhile it was fairly crowded when we arrived at 7 on a Wednesday night, the service was still attentive and the food delivered promptly.  Our attentive waiter was great (filled our water glasses when they were less than an inch from the top, always asking how things tasted, etc.).  By the time we left (sometime around 8:30-8:45) the bar area and dining area were both packed, evidence as to how popular this place is.\n\nI will definitely be returning to Han Dynasty to fill my next Chinese food craving!"

Not in a BW3's, Man vs. Food, drink some pepper spray type of way, but actually incorporating hot peppers as an ingredient to enhance the flavor of the dish so that you feel something other than heat is missing when you don't add it.  Han Dynasty does this very, very well.  The food is flavroful and not just hot for the sake of being hot.  I wish they had brown rice, but this restaurant will definitely be in my regular rotation."

The pork belly is awesome and I'd definitely recommend it, and the black bean fish was really flavorful and fresh as well (tons of veggies so my mom was really happy), but I wasn't in love with anything else. The eggplant wasn't as soft or creamy as it has been in the past, the tofu was a bit dry, and there wasn't very much pork in the dan dan noodles. \n\nThe UCity location is still good, just not as great as it was before."

A few years later, the buzz has died down a little, but Han is still the place to go for more authentic, less Americanized Chinese food in UCity. Plus, the spice is never a bad thing!\n\nSome things are VERY delicious here--I love how flexible the menu is, with different spice levels and choices of meat for each type of dish. Especially noteworthy are the Dan Dan Noodles (of course), the cold sesame noodles, and the garlic chicken. \n\nUnfortunately, the oiliness of the food has increased significantly in the past few years. We ordered the crispy rice chicken (as my boyfriend does not handle spice), and I didn't eat any of it based on the sourness of the thick, oily sauce. I also tried my friend's chili oil dumplings, but were disappointed in the oil and flavor as well; they seemed more like wontons than dumplings. In addition, many things are very pricey (although portions are HUGE and usually you can bring some back home. \n\nFinally, the service is the best I've received at a non-fancy restaurant, they continuously refill the white rice, and the dishes come out quickly. Just be careful of spending too much money; I recommend sharing dishes with friends family-style."

This was my first visit to the West Philly location (my go-to is Old City), and I have to say it is mystifying that this place has mostly held on to its reputation. \n\nThe West Philly location has some virtues: The design is sleek, contemporary, and casual, and we were promptly seated and served. This was a nice change from the kitschy, cavernous Old City location, where you practically have to wave your arms around to attract a server, even when the restaurant is empty. Here, the atmosphere and service were an improvement (although my friend's dish inexplicably arrived five minutes before mine, and we had to listen to an even more inexplicable soundtrack of N'Sync and Nelly). \n\nI ordered the double-cooked chicken. This is a dish I've had dozens of times at the Old City location, where the chicken is served in lean, bite-sized slabs. Here, there were large, rubbery pieces of meat-- the sort you might expect of cheap takeout, but not of the supposedly best Chinese restaurant in Philadelphia. Next I ordered the Kung Pow Tofu--a safe choice, I thought, since I've enjoyed it at the Old City location, and since it did not involve meat. Again, it was nothing like its Old City counterpart, whose small-diced vegetables (onion, scallions, peppers, water chestnuts) give each bite variety and texture. The dish becomes pointless when a single bite consists of a massive, spongy tofu triangle, or a giant, blanched bell pepper. My friend's vegetable fried rice was tasty, if misleadingly named, since there were no vegetables in it.\n\nI get that expansion often means a loss of quality control -- but would they try to sell this stuff in the recently opened New York location? Are they hoping that the nearby college campuses will provide a stream of customers regardless of quality? They would be wise to remember that not all people connected with campuses are students, and that students have standards too."

        "text": "Han Dynasty is the besttt. Definitely deserves its high rating on Yelp. \n\nFirst off, I love the interior decor. It's a very chill vibe. You can definitely see that Han Dynasty took the time to brand itself; it's not \"just another Chinese restaurant.\" Mad props. Also, they were playing \"Bloom\" by Odesza at some point, so that's another ten bonus points to them haha. \n\nCame here with a group of six people. We wanted more space, since Chinese meals are usually to be shared, and circular tables are preferred. Unfortunately, the circular tables were reserved, but they were accommodating enough, and put two rectangular tables together for us. I say \"accommodating enough,\" because I feel like one of the waitresses was lowkey judging us. \n\nAnyway, when it came time to order, my parents tried to speak Chinese to the waiter, but he didn't understand Chinese, so I ended up trying to translate all the Chinese items into English. This was kind of annoying, so if you want to order in Chinese, just be aware that some of the waiters don't speak Chinese. For me, it was fine though, because I'm a total ABC and prefer to speak in English LOL. \n\nSo anyway, on to the food. Food was SPICY. Spicy, but good. We ordered a bunch of stuff, but barely made a dent in most of them (\u773c\u5927\u809a\u5b50\u5c0f, amirite??). That said, it really was great food. Without further ado, here's what we ordered: \n\nDumplings in Chili Oil: This was hella spicy, so I didn't eat much. It was alright, not amazing. I wouldn't order again. \n\nEggplant w/ Garlic Sauce: This was pretty good. A bit more solid than I would have liked though. I'm used to more mushy eggplant, so I can mix it with my rice. Is that me being weird, or is that a legit preference?? I have no idea. But yeah, overall, good taste. Would order again. \n\nCumin Style Lamb: This was yummy! The lamb was tender. It was REALLY spicy though, so if you can't handle spice very well, do not order this. I was spiced OUT while eating this. The flavor was good though. I probably wouldn't order this again though, because too spicy for me. \n\nDry Fry Fish: OMG, this MADE the meal. I freaking loved this stuff. If I didn't have such a low tolerance for spicy stuff, I would've eaten the whole dish. It's spicy, but it also has this subtly sweet undertone. You don't expect that when you look at it, but when you taste it, it's such a nice surprise. I'm in love with this fish, and I'd go back to Han Dynasty just to taste this dish again. \n\nOh, also I forgot to mention that we came in around 1pm, and it wasn't crowded at all. More people did come in at 2pm. \n\nAlso, I think the service could've been a little better. I was spiced out and I wish they had filled my water more. \n\nOverall, this place was awesome. Chill vibes. Authentic Sichuan Chinese food. Will definitely be back."

Han Dynasty boasts a pretty wide selection of spicy szechuan style dishes that are probably some of my favorite in University City!\n\nI've been here previously several times, but I'll just mention the last time I came here for dinner. As usual, this place was pretty busy (even though my friend and I arrived pretty late, around 9). Nevertheless, we were quickly seated at one of the hightop tables. We decided to order with University City Dining Days and ended up with a ton of food (we might have even been able to split 1 \"meal\" between the two of us). We chose the dan dan noodles (which are a classic), hot pot style (which featured tender and spicy chicken), and kung pao chicken (which was also very tasty). For dessert, I chose to get the Grand \"Royale\", which was actually a lot stronger than I expected, but still was great. My friend got the 2 special macarons, which had super unique flavors. I tried a bit of the macarons, and I didn't really like the \"spicy citrus chocolate\", which tasted like it contained a \"ginger\"-y flavor.\n\nA few tips: try the dan dan noodles (unless you have peanut allergies) and don't be afraid to adjust the level of spicy according to what you feel is good. \n\nI'm usually skeptical of nice-looking places having great authentic chinese food (a bigger fan of authentic hole-in-the-wall locations), but there's really no getting around the fact that Han Dynasty is amazing."

A new level of chinese food quality (as expected for the high price!). \n\nThe mapo tofu was good. The tofu is very soft and delicate, which I enjoy (as an Asian diner perhaps), but my friend did not care for this consistency. A bit greasy and a little too spicy though... it is definitely a \"we're obsessed with the 1-10 spiciness scale because it is so trendy, so we're going to tarnish a typical, traditional dish.\" I think the 1-10 rating is a new, convenient option, but I hope that Han Dynasty will also respect the tradition of the dishes they are serving... even if the diner doesn't necessarily know what they are supposed to taste like in the first place. \n\nThe double-cooked flounder was OK. Kind of salty, which was disappointing for a $20 plate. Perhaps that is the flavor meant by \"double-cooked.\" Maybe it was the added spices. I am getting a bit tired of talking about spices, and most likely, you will get tired of eating the spicy foods. I recommend mixing in a more subdued, cooler dish to provide your mouth some relief. \n\nI will come back for dan dan noodles."

I'm sure you can see from other reviews, but be prepared for SPICY food. They will adjust the level of spice if you ask though, so don't be shy to ask if you can't handle high heat.\n\nSpicy Crispy Cucumber (5/5) - I order this every time I come here. The cucumbers are soaked in chili oil, so there is heat, but the freshness of the cucumbers takes away from the spiciness\n\nPork Belly w/ Sweet Garlic Chili Oil Sauce (4/5) - The pork belly is (I think?) boiled, so don't expect it to be crispy like other pork belly dishes. This is one of my favorite appetizers. The garlic adds a nice flavor to this dish.\n\nWontons in Chili Oil (3.5/5) - I really like the actual wonton itself, but these soak up a little too much chili oil for me\n\nDan Dan Noodle (4.5/5) - This dish is a staple of Han Dynasty. I love it so much that after I moved away from Philadelphia, I learned how to make it myself. The only reason I'm giving it a 4.5 instead of a 5 is that sometimes, it comes out kind of watery. A must have if you come to Han Dynasty.\n\nCold Sesame Noodle (3.5/5) - These noodles are a nice substitute for the Dan Dan noodles if you don't have a high heat tolerance. They are also a nice side dish to have so not EVERYTHING you eat is spicy. It is a little too sesame-y for me though.\n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup (4/5) - One of my favorite noodle dishes. The broth is nice and warm, and they are generous with the meat. This is also a nice, non-spicy dish to enjoy.\n\nSpicy Beef Noodle Soup (3/5) - This is a spicy version of the dish before. For some reason, there is something about the chili oil which I don't enjoy much. I don't like the way it coats my tongue when I am drinking the soup.\n\nDry Pepper Chicken/Fish (4/5) - I usually get this dish when I come here too. The level of fried is nice, and it is a pleasant level of heat. \n\nCumin Lamb (3.5/5) - Usually I enjoy cumin in my food, but this is a little too cumin-y for me. My other friends seem to really enjoy this dish though. Regardless, it is a pretty tasty dish, just a strong for my taste.\n\nCrispy Rice Chicken/Fish (4/5) - This dish is a favorite of my friends who can't handle spicy food. There is no heat, and the flavors are nice, with a assortment of mushrooms and bamboos shoots. I really enjoy the crispy rice, which is kind of like a rice cake."

Briefly, food and service are the main problem. Otherwise it is fine if you like the kind of food they call Chinese or Szechuan, which seems to me didn't even undergo cooking. It is basically just all pre-cooked stuff, vegetables and noodles (mushy, BTW) etc, overdosed with whatever sauce (spicy and greasy, sweet and/or nutty etc..) before served to you. Let me explain in detail..\n\nFirst the food. Well, it is food and kinda of edible, I agree that much, but not much more. We ordered the cold & spicy cucumber, which should be a super cheap and served cold so it's commonly a summer dish. It is usually made with crunchy fresh cucumbers, which are plentiful in the summer. The key to this dish is that the kind of cucumbers makes a huge difference. It has to be the flavorful Asian variety which are also dark green colored outside with very small to none seeds. English cucumber would be a closest substitution. The regular large, thick skinned, and tasteless variety with large and mature seeds, and are easily found at the supermarket here in this country simply would not serve the purpose. OK, just what I suspected, we were served with a bowl of this far inferior variety of cucumbers. Not only that, it is not EVEN \"cooked\". By \"cooked\" I mean this dish needs to be tossed with just the right amount of fresh chilly oil and freshly crushed garlic, a dash of Szechuan paper, the right level of sugar and salt, and that is all there is to it. Instead, the normally dark green skinned cucumber dish sitting in front of us is, ok, large, pale (peeled) tasteless cucumber cubes swimming in some sort of light brown gooey sauce. I braved myself with some of the saucy cubes, and they tasted way too sweet! And the sauce is, umm, some sort of peanut based, is my best guess. \n\nAnother simple cold dish - Dan Dan Noodles came way too mushy, clearly pre-cooked and sitting way too long to be ordered. It once again came with sweet sesame based sauce. Aside from being overly sweet, the main problem with this dish is the texture of the noodles. We might just like them better if we didn't still have nice and youthful chewing capability...\n\nI began to get suspicious about whether they actually do cook the dishes per customers' order or if they simply just combine the ingredient with what else... a sauce before serving.. The much raved mapo tofu might be a good indicator, I thought. Sure enough, it came overwhelmed with grease and a kind of spicy sauce. The tofu looked just like any other packaged stuff one can get at an Asian grocery store, nothing special. Just as I suspected, the dish was lukewarm, suggesting it was NOT freshly COOKED in a sizzling hot wok as most Chinese food should be.\n\nI could just go on and on with the remaining dishes we ordered - all came to us by the same cooking method, I could tell, which is NO COOKING - pre-cook all the main ingredients, then toss in generous amount of sweet, spicy and/or nutty sauce before serving. The price? yes, the price is about 20-30% higher than a similar dish in just about any Chinese restaurants in Chinatown.\n\nLastly, the service was so dismal that I didn't think they deserve any tip for the pretty much non-existent \"service\". We had to beg for water, for example. \n\nEnough due credit already given to this non-deserving, over-priced, over-hyped, poor service sauce factory.. or you could call it a 'restaurant' if all it does is to produce the sweet and spicy sauces."

They are not kidding about the spice level, though. Every time I come here I'm always throwing back glass after glass of water to deal with the spices they put in their dishes. But it is delicious nonetheless.\n\nGo for the pork belly in garlic sauce on the cold appetizers menu. It's as unhealthy as it tastes, but who cares?! I could eat an entire dish of that by myself. (Yes, it's meant to be shared.)\n\nOther favorite dishes of mine: prawns with asparagus (the prawns are HUGE. Big plus in my book.), dan dan noodles, beef in oyster sauce, scallion pancakes, cold sesame noodles...basically everything. Just go. Go. You won't regret it one bit."

I am a lover of all foods Asian, and I must say that this restaurant is NOT representative of any Chinese restaurant that I have ever been to. The owner of the restaurant found a way to perfectly master the blending of Asian spices to create the most delicious dishes. I have never been more fond of anise or Schezwan peppers. Even the staff is great!  They are knowledgeable about the menu offerings and ever changing draft and cocktail selections.    \nIf you do not like spicy food, this place may not be for you.  There are a few tame things on the menu - 3 cup chicken or salt and pepper shrimp if you MuSt...Spice level can also be reduced for all entrees.\n\nI can't possibly cover all the things on the menu that I love so I'll just list a few.\n\nDan Dan Noodles - Heat scale 6ish  \nOMG, I have no idea how something so simple can be made to taste so fabulously.\n\nCucumber in chili sauce - Heat scale 6ish  \nI didn't order this appetizer for ages because it sounds a little pointless, but what the title and menu neglect to mention is that the sauce that these crispy cucumber nuggets is in is only slightly less amazing than the Dan Dan noodle sauce.  \n\nCumin Lamb -  Heat scale 6ish\nI hate lamb, really I do.  I will take that hatred to the grave. There is something that Han Dynasty does to the lamb that makes it sing - yes SING.  There is no way to describe it.  Lamb is the best meat for this dish\n\nHot Sauce Fish - Heat scale 7\nWhat a delicious masochistic blend of gently fried fish, garlic, red pepper flakes and other special spices.  \n\nDry Pot shrimp or fish - Heat scale 10++\nThis is the spiciest Chinese dish I have ever eaten.  I prefer to share this with groups of people so I don't hurt myself too much because it is truly addictive.  If you can take the heat, get in the kitchen with this dish.  It will not disappoint!\n\nI have had a host of other Chef specials and mixed drinks, and I loved them all. This place is a little pricier than I prefer due to my addiction, but the cost doesn't come close to keep me or the droves of loyal customers away."

They're definitely a traditional Chinese restaurant in terms of food, but the atmosphere is westernized. Their food is definitely spicy, something I'm not necessarily good with. Luckily, they allow you to customize the spicy levels. \n\nThe service is fast and attentive, but there are little to no Chinese Waiters. Thus, if you're a traditional Chinese, plan on ordering in English (I don't quite remember if there's even Chinese on the menu). \n\nOverall, a good restaurant. It has a nice location close to both UPenn and Drexel, and the price is average to a little pricey. Good food, good location, good stuff."

The atmosphere is pretty nice and you have the choice to eat inside or outside and I've never had a problem with the service. \n\nRecommended dishes: \n- Dan Dan Noodles - there's a reason why this is their signature dish! The noodles are perfectly cooked and slightly chewy, and the waiter mixes the noodles/sauce right in front of you. In fact when I don't have this for a few months, I actually start to get cravings.\n- Szechuan Fish - it's hard to find a restaurant that makes fish well in Szechuan style. This one is perfect because the spiciness doesn't over-burden the taste of the fish. The fish is cooked really well and the pieces fall apart perfectly.\n\nDon't like anything dry pot style - it's so dry and spicy that I can't actually taste anything else during the meal..or for the rest of the day for that matter. Also don't really like the double cooked pork - comes out too 50% of the time and chewy to the point that it's hard to eat.\n\nOH and if you come here with a large group (30+) for an event, you can negotiate the tasting menu price - great deal to try everything on the menu if it's your first time!"

The meat is sort of squishy, which is something I expect from cheap Chinese places, but not an upscale one. The string beans with minced pork were awesome though.\n\nThey were playing the Eagles game behind the bar (Thursday night football), which pleased the boys in our group.

        "text": "I liked this place so much last time that I raved about it to all of my friends and came here again with a group of them. What a shame that this weekend's experience was both disappointing and embarrassing. \n\nI had made a reservation, which turned out to be a good idea because they were pretty busy. In the reservation, we had asked for an outdoor table. The hostess had reserved us an indoor table. We told her that we were willing to wait for an outdoor table to give the server some time, if he had been seated recently. While the hostess was reluctantly figuring out whether to give us an outdoor table, an older lady (maybe a manager?) came over and took us to an outdoor table. \n\nOur server was reasonably good. He frequently checked in on us. However, our water glasses remained empty for long stretches of time. When we were ready to order, the older lady who seated us came to take our order instead of our server. \n\nWe ordered 3 items for starters: the Dan Dan noodles, Crispy Rice Style Pork, and the Bok Choy vegetable dish, to which the older lady said, \"THAT'S IT?!?!\" followed by, \"THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO ORDER???\"  all in a very rude tone and incredulous facial expression. I almost choked. \n\nAs someone with many years in the restaurant industry, I understand  why one would prefer dining guests to order more. However, I did emphasize that we wanted to order those items as starters. Most restaurants don't have a problem with this. Also, even if I ever thought that a guest ordered too little, (I might secretly curse them out in my head, but) I would NEVER say it to the guest. \n\nAlso, as many reviewers point out, the portions are fairly large. I'm not  a hugely large eater and I don't think it's wrong to order a comfortable amount of food when dining at a restaurant. (We were still very full by the time we left.) The way the older lady reacted when taking our order was tacky and unprofessional, but the real disappointment was that it took over an hour for our orders to arrive (last time, it took only 10 min). It seemed like she \"forgot\" to give the kitchen our order... maybe because she thought we didn't order enough. \n\nAfter 45 minutes, we asked our server about our food. He promptly went to the kitchen and came back saying the food was on its way. 15 minutes later, we asked him again. He checked with the kitchen and said that they had run out of bowls. At the same time, a table of 3 just got seated near us. About 10 minutes later, that table of 3 received an order of Dan Dan noodles (in a bowl!) despite the kitchen's alleged lack of bowls. We still did not receive any of our items... not even the boiled vegetable side dish, which takes about 5 minutes to make. \n\nA few minutes later, a manager came out with yet another bowl of Dan Dan noodles, but he offered it to a couple who said they didn't order it. The bowl was sent back to the kitchen, though I suspected that it had been ours. I thought about lunging for it, but it disappeared before I could even blink. Another few minutes later, I talked to a girl who was checking on tables and got her to finally bring out our dishes. She apologized that our food \"took so long to arrive\" ... meaning 1.5 hrs in this case. My friends were really hungry (that's how they kept track of the exact time). I felt so badly about telling them how good Han Dynasty was. \n\nThis experience really deserves 1 star, but I'm giving 2 stars after taking my last visit into account. I believe the bad reviews a bit more now. I'm not sure if I can still recommend this place at the risk of having others wait 1.5hrs for their food and get rude service from that older lady (the hostess/manager/person who took down our order). We didn't ask for a discount, but if this happens to you, make sure you get yours."

I realize this is just me and not an indication of the food quality, but I would not try this place for the first time if you have things to do the next day.\n\nWhich comes to my second gripe, while I know chilli oil is the hallmark of Sczechuan, other flavors are nice too.

I came with a friend earlier when they just opened so they lacked essentials like some sort of dairy (which I need because I can't handle too much spice). Sadly, I had to suffer through the pain and tears of wonderful spices igniting my tongue on fire (literally). It was quite the burning sensation that I felt. Puns aside, the food was decent and pretty good. If you're looking for some good Sichuan style spicy food, this place is the place to go especially around the Penn campus."

It's so radically different from normal American Chinese restaurants in terms of the dishes offered and the flavor of the food. It is Szechuan style and (although I speak without knowing) seems incredibly authentic to this style of ethnic cuisine. It's got a very relaxed atmosphere, and the waiters are bubbly and excited to serve you. I came here for dinner with 4 others. \n\nAppetizers: \n-Scallion Pancake - Flaky and airy pancake with a wonderful sauce\n-Sweet and Spicy Cucumber - most incredible sauce I've ever had, some combination of garlic and ginger and nutty flavors that reminded me of Thai food. Complemented the sweetness of the cucumbers\n-Dan Dan Noodles - Soooo good. Basic thin noodles, with a very light but savory sauce coupled with it\n Main Courses:\n-Cumin Tofu - Really good. Strong cumin flavor... if you don't like cumin, stay away. The red chillies are not as hot or intimidating as they seem\n-Eggplant with Garlic Sauce - Cooked to perfection. I thought the sauce lacked complexity in flavor that other sauces here had, but it was still great\n-Tofu Crispy Rice Style - Really not good at all. The tofu was leathery, and the sauce was not flavorful at all, and tasted a little weird. Came with these rice krispy treats that I didn't think went with the dish well from a textural standpoint. Steer clear.\n Dessert:\n-Mochi - The Lychee Mochi had a strong lychee flavor that I found excellent, Triple Chocolate Mochi was superb, and Raspberry White Chocolate Mochi tasted a little bit like a strawberry milkshake from McDonald's strangely enough, but was fantastic regardless. Don't love the texture of Mochi, but these were worth giving a shot.\n\nI've been to other locations as well and Han Dynasty has never failed to disappoint. Just the best dang Asian food money can buy!"

If you're looking for more authentic Szechuan food at a better price, I think it would be worth it to just go to Chinatown. My friend and I shared the Kung Pao Chicken and Dry Pot Pork for lunch. The dishes were tasty, but I felt that it was a bit pricey for the amount and quality. Also, the Dry Pot Pork was rated 10/10 for spiciness, but I didn't think it was all that bad, and Szechuan food is supposed to be known for their spice. The service and atmosphere is great though, and I love the modern vibe mixed in with the traditional decorations."

The dish EASILY met all of the hype and was so scrumptious with a nice spicy kick that I wish we would have ordered seconds. For entrees, we shared the Dry Pot Style Chicken (spicy but not overwhelming), Garlic Sauce Style Pork, and Kung Pao Style Shrimp. There was a beautiful blend of flavors in each and I liked having the variety of dishes to try out.\n\nI've since gone to the Han Dynasty location in Old City and the food is exactly the same (and delicious) there as it is here. The big difference though is the ambiance/environment. If you want to have a nice, casual meal with friends head to Powelton Village, as the restaurant has a more modern feel. In contrast, the Old City building has huge ceilings and ornate decoration throughout. It's the perfect place to take your parents when they are in town or impress a lovely person on a third/fourth date. No matter which Han Dynasty you choose, you'll be treated to the most incredible Szechuan/Chinese cuisine around!"

I don't write that lightly.  The dishes that include chili oils were literally swimming in them and were absolutely awful.  Salty.  Drenched in oil and fat.  Two other aspects of dinning here should be noted:  this restaurant delights in placing numbers in red in parentheses at the end of each item.  The scale of 1 to 10 purports to measure the heat and can be adjusted.  I am not sure how one adjusts a dish whose principal ingredient is chili oil other than to vary the amount and I certainly would be hard-pressed to distinguish between, say, a three and four.  The other thing is that this restaurant is expensive.  The bill for four of us including two glasses of wine and a beer as the total liquor tab and no desserts with tip was $170.  Three appetizers.  Four entres and a share vegetable entre.  There are other and far less expensive alternatives for those seeking good Chinese cuisine.  Some people will argue the food here is authentic and not tailored to American tastes and that if you don't like it that way, go elsewhere.  I would argue some people eat insects, dogs and haggis, too."

It was a bit hot for hot tea but it was still very tasty. It took the waiter a little too long to take our order, I guess she forgot that she had customers outside. She apologized about her delay and took our order right away.\n\nWithin minutes our food and drinks were brought out and it was hot and delicious! If you LOVE spicy food then this is the place for you! Im not a fan of spicy food so I ordered the Scallion chicken which had no spice rating and then my boyfriend got the garlic chicken which had a spice level of 3. The level 3 was spicy enough and the levels go up to 10 so I cant imagine how spicy that is. All the dishes are family style so it was very easy to share.

It's nice and refreshing.  I got it less sweet and on the rocks. (and you should too!)\n\nDan dan noodles are so simple and delicious.  Something that I could probably just make myself, but why bother when I could just make a call and have Han Dynasty make them for me!   \n\nShared the above and the Spicy Aroma Fish special that had a spice level of 10 but wasn't that spicy for some reason.  I think it's because although it might look spicy, it was more oil than that \"punch you in the face\" spice.  The spice was more of an after hit than a \"tongue numbing\" experience.  Namean?\nThe fish was a flaky white fish and the dish was filled with veggies and some glass noodles, but it was a really oily dish that left me feeling heavy and unsatisfied - and it will not be ordered again.\n\nDecor is trendy and casual.  Service was slow for us.  I think at the time of our dining experience, our server was new so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and leave it at that.  \n\nNext time I come here I'm bringing a group and really doing it up family-style.

And because I'm not sure whether \"al dente\" is the right word to use for pasta in a szechuan restaurant, let's just say these noodles have the perfect amount of chew to them. Other favorites are the dumplings in chili oil, the scallion pancakes, and the dry pot style with fish. \n\nAlso - I should mention that I tend to get really thirsty at restaurants, and was impressed with how diligent these guys are at refilling water!

On top of that, when we were charged, the waiter added the food we hadn't originally ordered.

Two things I've noticed about the 10+ times I've eaten here: (1) it's not as spicy as people make it sound at first and (2) I usually eat too much because the food is too good.\n\nMost of the dishes here are hot and satisfying, and served in generous portions that are good for sharing. The formula for the dishes here seems to be one meat + one spice. I'm a particular fan of the cumin-style lamb, or anything dry-fried or cooked long hot pepper-style. If you want something more saucy (instead of dry-cooked), the crispy rice style is good, and comes with bamboo shoots and various mushrooms in a creamy sauce (not spicy). For a vegetable, I'd recommend the pea-leaves with garlic (also not spicy), which is simple and a nice break from the meats. Some purists may complain that the dishes aren't 100% authentic, but they're still really delicious and tastily seasoned. They also have some creative menu items, like the spicy hot pot and tea-smoked duck in beer sauce, which sound delicious, although I haven't tried them yet. In terms of appetizers, the spicy oil wontons and cold cucumbers are usually good starters.\n\nThe best way to experience this place is to come with a large group for dinner. If you have 8 or more people, you can also opt for the tasting menu at $25-35/person, where they'll serve a variety of appetizers and dishes to your preference/spice level, in family style (shared dishes). It's best to come hungry for this, because there will be a LOT of food, and it will be good. If you pick the higher price range they will sometimes also throw in some off-menu extras, like lobster. Definitely a recommended experience.\n\nThe servers here consistently do a good job of making you feel welcome and comfortable, especially if you come in a group, and they always explain what the dishes are before bringing them out. There is also always ample tea and rice to go with whatever delicious Han-concoction you're eating.\n\nThough it's usually a dinner place, I've come here for a quick lunch once or twice. They have smaller dishes as well as beef noodle soup, which was decent.\n\nThe ambiance is a bit like Landmark Americana crossed with a contemporary art museum, but it still looks pretty cool. Everything in the restaurant is always spick and span. They also have charging stations for your phone!"

Nonetheless, I still liked it.\n\nTofu Cumin: This was the star of the meal.  It was very good and appropriately filled with cumin flavor.  I would definitely order this again.

Speaking of deals, this is place has a legitimately good deal for University City Dining Days. \n\nI went with a group of friends for Han Dynasty's 3 course dining days menu. I know some people frown down on restaurant week, but portion and selection were not problems here. We received regular sized appetizer and entre portions. Our third course could either be dessert or a choice of two alcoholic beverages. I was planning on having a drink anyways so I went with the Grand Royal as my third course. Doing some quick math, it was like getting a drink for free with my dinner. \n\nWith five in the group, it made sense to try each of the five appetizers being offered: cold sesame noodles, dumplings in chili oil, dan dan noodles, spicy crispy cucumbers and Sichuan pickled veggies. The dan dan noodles are everything people say they are, and easily were a group favorite. The cucumbers were served cold and were a very refreshing savory dish. The cold sesame noodles were also great. The pickled veggies were probably the least favorite of the selection. According to the menu, they were at spice level 10 on a 1 to 10 scale. I was ready to totally underestimate the spice scale at that point. I probably could have also walked away from the table full and gone home happy. \n\nDespite the vast array of appetizers ordered, each member of my party went with a variation of the Dry Pot. All but one of us went with the maximum spice level possible, and even poked fun at our friend for going with a 7. At the end of the meal, he was the only one at the table who wasn't sweating, crying or dealing with a runny nose. My dry pot chicken was extremely spicy and to be honest I probably would have enjoyed it better a notch or two down. You've been warned. It was still delicious though! \n\nThe only thing restaurant week-esq was the service. Our server was friendly, but not really attentive. The place was by no-means packed either. We were told that there would be a gap between our appetizers and entrees but then 2 out of 5 entrees came out early. A few of us also asked for clean plates for the entrees. It was an odd time during the meal because we still were working on our appetizers but also had our entrees. One of the staff members brought me a new plate and took away my appetizer plate that I told her I was still eating off of. My husband was able to retain his until he finished shortly after. \n\nHaving only dined at the Manayunk Han Dynasty, I was impressed by the open and lofty atmosphere. It was spacious and modern looking. \n\nService aside, we really enjoyed our overall experience. And since it was Dining Days, I'm not going to hold it against them. We also learned a valuable lesson: when Han Dynasty says spicy, they mean it!"

The place was about half-full; we only had to wait a few minutes for the servers to push some tables together for our group. We had no reservation, but they treated us like VIPs, anyway.\n\nI was finally able to try the Dan Dan noodles because we split two bowls around the table. I would highly recommend trying that. They were happy to hold the pork from one of the bowls, for the vegetarians among us, and the noodles were quite tasty and spicy on their own. I also sampled the spicy crispy cucumbers (great), the scallion pancake (fantastic, but still not as good as my Chinese friend's dad makes them), and the lunch portion of the bok choy with a delightful chewy mushroom. It's nice that you can get most of the entrees as lunch portions for a fraction of the price at the lunch hour. I'm thrilled that we have such a fantastic Chinese option in University City!"

This gem of a restaurant was recommended by a friend about two years ago and since then I've been going here at least twice a month (sometimes even 4 times). \n\nSince my tolerance for spice levels is on the higher side-I usually get dishes at between 7 and 9 (and the dry pepper style chicken at a whooping 10) so my mouth is almost always on fire, but it's absolutely worth it. \n\nFavourite Appetisers-dumplings in chilli oil. Favourite Entrees-chicken in hot sauce style, eggplant in garlic sauce, dry pepper chicken. I also recently tried a pork dish with celery-and it was pretty delicious. Also worth trying are the three cup chicken, fried chinese cabbage, and cumin lamb. \n\nI dont usually eat the generic Kung pao's and General Tso's at chinese restaurants-especially here--because this place has SO much more to offer and it's so much more delicious!!!"

Han Dynasty in UCity is definitely better than the original since it's a lot loftier with free parking, a nice bar area, a higher end venue altogether. It always have space to accommodate a large party like my friends and I. The staff here is way more professional. Instead of giving off that \"you're lucky to dine here\" vibe, they give you a sense that they really want you to be there. \n\nMy favorite dish is still the double cook fish, the sesame noodle, beef and tripe in chili oil and pork belly in garlic sauce, but they have an UCity specific special menu with special items. During Chinese new year, they had a special special menu with stir-fried razor clams shaped like a peacock that was superb. Fried Taiwanese sausage is sweet and unlike the traditional Chinese sausages I had. Three cup chicken is also sweet little chunks of delights.\n\nWith such a welcoming crew, no wonder Han Dynasty is expanding and opening up more and more stores catering to people who wants to add more spice in their life. One of them just happens to be Jose Garces. I spotted him and his family dining the other night and I was star struck only to be too chicken s#*t and too polite to disrupt a family dinner to get my pictures taken with him.

The cumin was the tastiest, but spicy! The hot sauce style was littered with szechuan peppercorns, which I'd never really had much of before, and which are a blast. The numbing sensation is the perfect antidote to the extreme heat. The garlic sauce style was the closest to what I think of as \"chinese\" food, but so elevated, so good!\n\nThe service was spotty, but it's still the soft open.

The service here makes all the difference.\n\nChinese food is very eclectic and each person likes different aspects of it.

Overall, I really enjoyed the food and I think this is one of the best chinese restaurants in Philly. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes, so here are my thoughts that stood out. Our table did like the food a lot:\n\nHot Sauce beef. This was a really good dish. The beef was tender, and the oil had a good spicy flavor. This could have had more peppercorns.\nLazi Chicken (dry spice chicken). The classic sichuan dish was very well executed and light and crispy. The signature dish!\nThe cold pork belly appetizer was very good, and its something that you don't see that often. \nThe Dan Dan noodles were great. There was a good peanut flavor without being excessive. We ordered 3 of them and everyone loved it. This was the favorite of the table.\nWe got an eggplant dish, I think I was spicy garlic style. I feel like this dish could have used something crunchy or kind of garnish. \nThe one dish that was a miss was the smoked beer duck. It was listed as a specialty, but there was not too much tenderness/spice to it.\n \nOverall I think the dishes were slightly lacking in spiciness. Maybe for more western diners it was spicy, but from other Sichuan restaurants I went to, the spice level could have been increased especially for the (10) spicy dishes. There could be more peppercorns in the dishes for the numbing flavor.\n\nService: Although the food came really really fast, I thought that the waiter could have been more attentive. They didn't really come to check in on us enough as we ordered a second round and we had to wait a while. They could have cleared each of our plates quicker and given us a lot more rice.This and the spiciness issue above made me dock just 1 star.\n\nPrice: We got a lot of food and with tax and tip (20% gratuity automatically added for our group) it was only $24 a person."

A classic in University City is Han Dynasty that brings modern life to Chinese food. I was excited not see a General Tso, Sesame Chicken or Chicken Broccoli dish on the menu. Since we were there during the weekend, street parking on the street was free. Otherwise, they do have metered street parking and a parking deck around the corner. If you're using the parking deck, hold on to that ticket stub! Han Dynasty will validate the ticket for you so you don't have to pay.\n     Walking in, you'll be surrounded by a mix of students in the area and families. You can order out from them, sit at the bar or get a table. If you have a large party, they have long, bench-style tables where you can all sit together. It's classical embellishments with a clean, modern feel. You're greeted by a server who will walk you to your designated area; my sister and I went with a table by the window. While we sipped on some hot green tea, we decided to go with an appetizer and two entrees (family style) to share. My sister recommended the spicy, crunchy cucumbers while we waited for the two entrees to come out: black bean chicken and hot sauce style chicken.\n\nSpicy, Crunch Cucumbers | At first glance, it looked like cucumbers in liquid so I didn't think it would be crunch. I was wrong. The sauce with hints of vinegar and soy permeated the outer layer of the cucumber leaving the inside nice and crunchy. It was tasty yet refreshing.\n\nBlack Bean Chicken | I had never had a sauce based on black beans and it seemed like it would have been too thick. The sauce was light and as a great medium to bring out the other spices without it being overwhelming the chicken. It was sauteed in with some chunky onion and bell pepper pieces. Huge fan!\n\nHot Sauce Style | You have your options of eight different concentrations (Chicken, Pork, Beef, Lamb, Fish, Shrimp, Scallops and Fried Tofu). We went with the sliced pieces of chicken stir fried with cabbage, garlic and celery in a szechuan chili oil-based hot sauce. Although the menu notes it as spicy, the dish was not spicy. The chili oil sauce was nice and thick and paired well with the white, sticky rice they provided us.  You can taste the use of garlic however it wasn't overwhelming with the hot chili taste.\n\nThe staff was friendly checking in with us in a timely manner to see if we needed anything. Additionally, they have restrooms for their customers. Overall, it's currently #1 in my category for my Chinese food category. Highly recommend all of the items mentioned above!"

The restaurant is always at least half full every time I have been there and with very good reason.\n\nMy first experience with the \"handy nasty\" was when I used to be vegetarian. I had been concerned that I wouldn't be able to sample everything since there were so many meat options. My server went out of her way to check with the kitchen that the dishes I ordered would be vegetarian-friendly and accommodated my other requests. The many other times I have been here since, the wait staff has always been friendly and helpful. They do a great job of refilling your rice, expediting your food, and are always ensuring that you're enjoying yourself.\n\nAs for the food, the flavors are always robust and are some of the most authentic in West Philly. I recommend the Dan Dan Noodles and the Eggplant with Garlic Sauce. They are both more mild, but are flavorful and classics worth getting every time. All the entree dishes also offer many chances to be adventurous in your flavor combination or spice level with all the different styles. The food can get a bit oily, though. Spicy dishes (most likely due to added chili oil), and dishes that have larger amounts of sauce tend to accumulate grease, most noticeable in take-out orders or leftovers. My friends and I are often deterred from getting the Handy Nasty because of the prospect of getting oil everywhere.\n\nOverall, good service, good food, good fun. Great place to go for authentic flavor and spice."

The wonton in chili oil was also a must-have and the chili oil was actually so good we ended up using that as a dipping sauce for our meal.

It sucks you can't have them add tofu into this dish, but still one of the best dishes on the menu. The scallion pancakes with the dipping sauce were also delicious - I've never had scallion pancakes but these were great. Soft inside, crispy outside and balsamicy / spicy dipping sauce. Might have finished one order of these on my own... Finally the kung pao tofu was my favorite tofu entree - full of veggies, not too oily, and well fried tofu. \n\nPros:\n+Incredible pricing - we ordered what seemed like the whole menu, and only spent $15 per person (crazy!)\n+Extremely fast and accommodating service, even though more than the half the party was late to the reservation time. They seated us immediately and no snobbery about the party being late / accommodating extra chairs\n+Delicious food at very reasonable prices for being a relatively trendy / swanky restaurant (not at all fast-foodey)\n\nCons:\n-Some tofu dishes were not distinct in flavors - just seemed like different veggies, same sauces\n-Waiter did not explain the hotness concept - our noodles were not as spicy as we hoped and our other tofu dishes were just bland.

She was awfully confused when I said a table for 1 - and then she went to play with the iPad more. The (I assume) manager motioned me toward this table and I said no - this was the kind of table you seat parties of 1 at.

It's surprising that what might be America's best small chain of Chinese food comes from Philly rather than a bigger city like LA or NYC. But I digress... anyway, I come here a lot and I usually get the same dishes. It's usually quite good, though I'll knock them a point for being very inconsistent. Sometimes it's perfect but other times it's sloppy and like someone was cooking it who had all the right recipes and ingredients but not the correct culinary training. For example, my favorite dish, double-cooked-style fish. Sometimes it's just lightly braised and other times it's nearly full-on deep fried (it's not supposed to be full-on deep fried). Sometimes the sauce tastes rather like black bean sauce, other times more like buffalo wing sauce, other times a little bit closer to \"salt & pepper style\". It usually still tastes very good though so I don't complain. It's great that they swiftly deliver within University City, though I wish they would get on GrubHub/Seamless or Eat24 so I can avoid the hassle of calling my order in. Also, the $2 per person upcharge for brown rice is a bit excessive -- most restaurants will swap in brown rice for you for free or only an extra. $1.

Me and my coworkers were all excited to order out \"baller Chinese food\" for lunch at work when our usual day consists of mundane cafeteria/boring chain options. As an Asian myself, I judge Asian cuisine with a more critical eye since you can get great quality at economical prices. But I am basing this review not on my own experience slash tough to please expectations but my co-workers as well. Many ordered the Dan Dan and two of the three regardless of spice levels came out almost inedible. Noodles were soggy and you tasted the sweet and salty and peanut buttery all mushed up in one bite. Very unappetizing. One coworker was discerning enough to order the sauce on the side however her sauce was hot as hell and intolerable for most. In general, most food options came out basically either oily as hell or hot as hell or both. Not my idea of enjoyable food, hey maybe for the next sucker who can appreciate this stuff. Regardless, of my own personal bias about this place, I try to be open minded that a lot of people (non-Asians) do love this place but on this particularly day this oily hot food deflated us all or shall I say thee flatus to us all. I do give them two stars on their well executed twice cooked pork belly and chili oil dumplings. Being a lover of all things, pork belly, it was refreshing to taste it in an Asian format since a lot of place cook it wrong and it comes out bland but certainly not at Han dynasty. My only gripe is that it lacked the crispy charry charm that people love about pork belly but it was still damn good."

I usually get the garlic chicken or the mapo tofu, and I love it. I tried the dry pepper chicken once and it was delicious but oh so spicy. It's something that you just wanna keep eating even though it's so spicy. The service here is average, nothing too exceptional and not bad either. We (3 people) would normally finish ordering and eating lunch in about 45-50 minutes. \nI haven't been here in so long, it's definitely time to make a visit soon."

I heard a rumor that Han's mom is Taiwanese and his dad is Sichuanese. It shows up on the menu, with Taiwanese dishes such as Three Cup Chicken () and Sichuan dishes such as Dan Dan Noodles (). We had the dan dan noodles, waterboiled chicken, pea leaves, and tofu with pickled vegetables. Delicious! Spicy, but not too salty.\n\nThe restaurant itself is rather attractive and has a nice selection of beers. The place used to be an American seafood restaurant, and I do not think they have changed much. Nonetheless, the old place was only there two or three years and had done a complete renovation, so the place is very nice."

Interestingly, all the noodle dishes we had as appetizers were super spicy, but all the entrees were very mild.  I would have liked it better the other way around, because we were kind of full and spiced out by the time the entrees arrived,  Instead of dessert you can get a cocktail which was a really nice option.  Everyone got to take home at least two dishes.  I don't know if it was just an off night, but the dan dan noodles were kind of terrible, and I usually love them."

Good service.  \n\nI'll review the food roughly in (descending) order of preference:\n\n1. The highlight of the meal for me was the SESAME NOODLES, which were delicious and more deeply flavoured than versions served elsewhere.  Definitely want those noodles again.\n\n2.  I also enjoyed the Cucumbers in Chili Oil, Garlic sauce tofu, as well as some fairly standard though well-prepared Pea leaves, Bok Choy w/ Black mushrooms, and Eggplant.\n\n3.  Hot sauce scallops were breaded and deep-fried, and silken in texture inside -- the core of the scallop was still raw and soft.  Only problem was that the dish was so oily that I couldn't pick up any pieces of cabbage or other food wo/ picking up tons of oil with it.\n\n4. Thinly sliced Double cooked pork belly is flavourful with leeks.  Texture could be improved -- pork seemed a bit overcooked.\n\n5. Many dishes are dominated by the smoky-spicy flavours of Szechuan peppercorns.  It's worth a try if you like spicy & haven't had them before.  These dishes (Vegetarian ma po tofu without pork, Mung bean noodle) were not my personal favourites although they were definitely flavourful.\n\n6. Fried veggie dumplings were disappointing:  the dumpling skin was much too thick & the filling was on the bland side.  I would avoid these.  My dining companions also apparently felt the same way; nobody seemed to want more dumplings after they had tried their first.\n\nAll in all, it was pretty good (especially by Philly standards) & I'd definitely return for Sesame noodles and some of the other dishes."

Since Superman's wingman didn't want to mess up his hair by flying on Superman's back to Philly, we took an earthmobile.\n\nJust to let everyone on I-95 know exactly who was traveling alongside them, your fave SuperHero let his cape flutter out the window. Also, he gave sketchy characters his all-knowing and piercing gaze while drooling on his spandex flight suit as he extended his head out the window like a slobbering canine.\n\nSuperman often practices his flying positions while leaning out a car window, although he sometimes gets clipped at those annoying toll booths since he never slows down. You see, Superman doesn't pay earthly tolls or taxes. Earth should be paying him for fighting crime and evil!!!! Not the other way around! Superman will talk to Obama about this, since they're both foreigners according to Donald Trump.\n\nDon't worry, Superman rubbed out those disgusting drool marks before emerging from the earthmobile.  He has his adoring public to consider, after all, and must maintain his image and be ever available for random photo requests with his fans.\n\nSuperman received many friendly gestures from these passing motorists, which his friend described as \"Half a Peace Sign.\"  This single figure salute doesn't exist on planet Krypton but is often seen by Superman on his earthly missions.  Thank you, earthlings, for acknowledging that Superman is number 1!!!!\n\nBack to the Philly adventure. This Chinese restaurant is one of six in Philly owned by a Taiwanese family.  Superman met Cindy, the adorable cousin of the owner, as he was leaving.  However, Superman's Kreepy Krypto charm didn't work. He was not comped and had to pay full freight for his outstanding lunch. And this was after he left a big tip!\n\nSuperman wanted to retrieve said tip, but his crafty waiter had already scooped it up.\n\nSuperman's Philly friend (a Chinese expert) ordered for our group and even your faithful YelpMeister Review King had his eyes water and his throat constrict at the hotness of the food.  But it was good and the ambiance was nice, spacious and retro inside a new building a few blocks from the UPenn Campus.\n\nHey, btw, if you want to annoy a UPenn student, ask them how they like going to a big state university.  They'll say \"Penn is in the Ivy League! You're thinking of Penn State!\"\n\nYou can say, \"Penn is NOT in the Ivy League!  Only swanky private universities like Harvard are in the Ivy League!!!\"  The Penn students will give you the special Half a Peace Sign salute and slink away.\n\nSuperman resents these snotty Ivy Leaguers. Believe it or not, Superman has humble roots and got a full ride at the State University of Krypton while starring on their Intergalactic Bocce Ball Team (see previous review for Pearl Dive for his bocce ball prowess).\n\nHan Dynasty rules, but be careful if you order hot and spicy food since your mouth will be torched and your eyes will pop out of their sockets. Ask for Cindy and tell her Superman sent you!"

I really enjoyed my lotus cocktail.  \n\nUnfortunately my gluten free friend was extremely sick about 2 hours later.  Mystery? I think not.

I went into the tasting menu option very wary, because I thought it wouldn't be worth my money to pay $20 for the huge amount of dishes, when I assumed majority of them would be meat-based....\n\nBUT\n\nWhen I told the server I was a vegetarian, she went out of her way to notify the chefs, who then made 75% of our tasting menu vegetarian-friendly--meaning I could enjoy almost all of the absolutely deliciously perfect dishes as much as my friends could! There is a LOT of wonderful food in the tasting menu, though, so it's definitely worth your money if you're coming in a large group of 8+ people to do it, as long as you notify them that you're vegetarian!\n\nAnd, again, I just want to echo the friendliness of the waitstaff and the cool ambiance of the restaurant as a whole. I am so pleased that Han Dynasty is a presence now in U City, and I look forward to visiting often!\n\n(Also, the free spicy crispy cucumbers for each check are awesome! Take note that it's one free order per table, though.)"

        "text": "This place is inconsistent. The service here was terrible this Wednesday night that we went. The hostess claimed that the only seating available indoors was at the bar. The bar was an extreme inconvenience to share food. It made our entire dining experience extremely uncomfortable, especially since we saw 2, 3 empty tables. When we asked whether we could sit there instead, the hostess told us they were all reserved in a cold rude way. Really!?!!?!?!? NO ONE CAME IN AND SAT AT THOSE TABLES THE ENTIRE TIME WE WERE THERE. Can you please STOP pretending that you're that busy!!?!?!?! We might have been more understanding if the short asian hostess was more courteous. However, she had a poor attitude that night, and the previous times I've been here as well. A hostesss job is the most important because it is the first thing a customer experiences when he/she come into the restaurant. When someone has a sour attitude it automatically ruins the night\n\nThe food was kind of inconsistent too. I've ordered the Taiwanese sausage fried rice several times here. The first time I was here, they cooked it without white onion. Some other times thereafter, they cooked it with onions. My friend wanted them to cook it without the white onion this time, but for some reason, this was a really difficult task. The bartender with a diastema (google diastema) said that \"oooh but they sautee the onion in.\" Yes, but please saute without it, it is doable. We've had it before. What are you going to do if someone is actually allergic to onions?!?!?! Just don't add the ingredient. We didn't want to deal with the bartender's incompetence so we just ordered it with the sauteed onions anyways. It also annoyed me that he asked us whether we wanted to add soy sauce to the fried rice. The previous times we came, soy sauce was not added. That's how regular Taiwanese sausage fried rice is made. When we told him we wanted the regular fried rice, he replied with\"Yeh but there are two kinds, one with and without\". No, the regular kind is without soy sauce, which we've had loads of times. The bartender was also extremely slow. He had some trouble with our bill too. There should be an actual waiter in the bar area. The bartender should stick to chatting up customers. Don't expect any efficient service from him.\n\nThe food that night was below average. We also ordered the three cup chicken which was pretty Americanized. I didn't care for it. Although, I do know that this is a Sichuan restaurant, so it's understandable that it's not amazing here. The cabbage that was too oily and flavorless (it was actually pretty good the previous times times I had it before). It tasted like the sauted bean sprout I had here at a prior visit - oily and tasteless. Han Dynasty, please lay off the oily, and remember to add salt to your vegetables.\n\nThe cold sesame noodle was the only redeeming thing of that night. The service needs to be improved. One of my friends said that last time he was here, he had a strange dining experience as well. His waiter got on to his knees to take orders. I'm not one to care about good service that much, however when the food we want is not up to par, it bothers me a lot more. I'll be back despite such an unpleasant dining experience. Hopefully that incompetent bartender and that rude hostess will not be there."

We placed an order for pick up asking if it was possible to add tofu to the vegetable lo-mein. \"No,\" we were flatly told by the woman on the other end. She offered no alternative and when her silence forced me to ask, \".....well......what IS possible?\" She suggested a lo mein full of meat. After putting me on hold for several minutes while she had to consult with someone else about adding tofu to our dish, she told me that for an extra $2 per entree it would be possible. Nothing spectacular about the customer service here. \n\nFast forward to thirty minutes later when my partner and I take our first bites: flavorless, overcooked, and needlessly oily. Hard to know what would have been in the dish had we not ordered tofu. I detected about 4 scallion slices....2 very thin carrot strings...not much else.  The tofu was of such poor quality that we ultimately found it inedible. \n\nI was so hoping to love this place but if they can mess up a dish as simple as lo mein, so as to make it not just flavorless be actually unpleasant to eat....it's hard to find the steam to every eat here again."

The place looked packed from the outside, but only needed to wait 2 minutes. We street parked across from the restaurant but later read on the menu that guests of Han Dynasty can get free parking if you ask how. So.. ask before you go?\n\nOur waitress was really helpful and knowledgable. She explained to us how the menu works and recommended us her favorites, so we went with it. Ordered dumplings in chili oil (level 4 spice) as an appetizer and Double Cooked Style Fish (level 7 spice) for the entre\u00e8. I LOVE spicy food and the spice levels made my nose just a tad runny. Meanwhile my friend who's typically ok with spicy was doing that inhale thing through his clenched teeth hahaha.\n\nAnyways our choices were the bomb and I had to give my friend a high five for getting the perfect meal. We shared the order and it was SOO filling. It was made to order, came out super fast, big portions, flavorful. The fish was delicious.. the inside melted in my mouth. Oh and I NEVER ran out of water which means a lot to me, for someone who drinks a lot while eating.\n\nSpent about $30 but we were in and out of there in exactly 1 hour and it was an amazing dinner. I don't typically eat Chinese food but this was a really pleasant surprise. I live an hour and a half away from this place, but my friend who goes to school nearby said he'd definitely be back."

I've been here several times and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is pretty cool in both of their Philly locations and the service is usually quite prompt. Their menu also has numbers between parenthesis to show the spice level, but I've found some of these aren't always that accurate and most dishes err on the milder side and you can always ask your server to adjust the spice level to your liking. I've been here with small and large parties and it's always fun sharing and trying new dishes and there are plenty of veggie-centered vegan and vegetarian options. Some of my favorites are the dumplings in chili oil, dan dan noodles, eggplant in garlic sauce, kung pow chicken or chicken in garlic sauce. If you're looking for a little something sweet to cool off your tongue after dinner, I recently tried their ice cream sampler which consists of red bean, green tea and ginger flavored ice creams. They're all pretty taste and none of the flavors are overly sweet, but favorite is definitely the ginger. There's just something about the food here that keeps me coming back and even though I've moved out of Philly I think I'll still be coming back when I'm in town."

I was always eh eh about the Han in Old City because the basement feels like a dungeon. I know that's what adds to the appeal of true Han lovers, but it just feels like a dungeon to me. University City is decorated great and the service is spot on. Check in on Yelp and get a free order of Spicy Crispy Cucumbers.\n\nWe started with the Cucumbers and the Wontons in Chili Oil. I don't even like cucumbers, but Han makes them pretty tasty. The sauce is delish and you still get the refreshingness of the cucumbers. Every time we order the wontons in chili oil, and every time we realize that we meant to order the other dumplings. The chili oil is definitely too over powering for me. We also got the Dan Dan noodles, which were miraculously delicious this time around, and the Three Cup Chicken, which was standard and great but we were so full we barely made a dent. The noodles are often too spicy for me, so we asked them to lower the spice from 6 to 4. This made a huge difference, and I left without my entire mouth/throat on fire.\n\nThis location is great, and I'll be happy to come back whenever my boyfriend is craving some chili oil and dan dan.

Yes, I may be a bit of a 'punk' on the spice level.(pay attention to the spice levels listed in the menu.. they'll even cater (and change) to your spice tolerance on dishes too). I'm more adventurous in a group setting... I exercised my spiciness chops at a couple b-day dinners I've attended.. including my own that I had at the Han Dynasty in Uni City.  I'd totally recommend going in a large party.. the pricing is right, there's so much food, the chef caters the menu to your group's taste and it's just great to taste all the various wonderful dishes on their menu. Everything is made to order, served hot (and sometimes under flames) to your table. It's just good.. SPICY and good.

We were excited about this new option as we all work in the area and especially with the great reviews that the Old City location receives. Boy were we mistaken. \n\nThe place wasn't too crowded since it was pouring rain outside. We had a reservation and were seated right away. Water and tea were immediately brought to our table. That's where the service stopped. It took an inordinate amount of time for the waiter to come and ask if we needed anything as two of our party had yet to arrive. Once they had arrived, it was another long wait. Since this was a family style restaurant, we ordered wonton soup to share, a tofu lunch entree, a dinner sized crispy rice chicken entree and another dinner sized garlic sauce shrimp entree (we were told that the lunch entrees are about 70% of the size of a dinner entree).\n\nThe soup took almost 45 minutes to come out to us and it was truly awful. Immediately you could see that it had way too much oil in it. It may have even been vegetable oil, because that was all you could smell or taste. When they delivered the soup, they apologized for the delay, but no one ever came back to check on how we were doing.\n\nDifferent servers brought us our entrees at different times, so we waited an additional amount of time until the vegetarian option arrived, so that we didn't leave out a member of our party. The crispy rice and chicken entree was bland, except for the enormous amount of sliced ginger. The garlic sauce shrimp was fairly good. Again, no one ever came back to check on how we were doing.\n\nIt took another inordinate amount of time for them to clear our food and then someone from our party actually had to go and ask for the bill from our waiter, since he still hadn't returned. In fact he was blithely walking around and talking to other servers.\n\nAll in all, we were all seated at the restaurant at noon and we did not leave until 2:00 p.m. For a restaurant catering to the businesses and universities in the area, which require a need for fast turnarounds at lunch, this was completely unacceptable.\n\nWe were especially disappointed as we are always rooting for new restaurants to be successful in the area and Han Dynasty has a good reputation. Perhaps this experience was a one-off but considering we all have time and budget limitations none of us are going to return anytime soon to see if they redeem themselves."

By the time our dinner was done a few hours later, things had quieted down a lot. \n\nHan Dynasty has lots of vegetarian/vegan options, though they're not very clearly marked on the menu. (The servers can help with this, of course.) I especially loved the eggplant, the cumin tofu (which, in spite of being rated 7 out of 10 on the spicy scale, wasn't very spicy at all), and the tofu dish with crispy rice.  Scallion pancakes and veggie dumplings were good, too. The way to do it at a place like this is definitely to order a variety of dishes to share.\n\nService was good overall, though our food came out very slowly. (Granted, we were a big group at a busy time.) Waters and tea were on our table when we arrived, which was nice. \n\nThe beer and cocktail list is good; I tried the \"Han's Cup,\" which is a version of a Pimm's cup made with rye whiskey. It sounded odd but tasted great, and my fellow conference goer who is a London native and not usually a big Pimm's cup fan liked the sip of mine he had so much that he ordered one of his own, and kept raving about it the next day!"

We called ahead and I asked for a very mild order of the dan dan noodles (I'm breastfeeding and the baby gets really angry when I eat spice). We are the scallion pancake in the car on the way home (they were incredible) and waited until we got home to jersey to eat the noodles. They were not mild at all. I couldn't even eat them. I'm so angry and disappointed because I have had them mild before and these definitely weren't."

Seemed understaffed, had to flag down a waiter after sitting w. the menu for about 8 minutes.  \nDan Dan noodles were a bit gluey, something was off in the preparation.  Pork dumplings were very doughy, flavorful, but not all the dough heated enough to have any crispness, so again, something in the cooking technique was lacking.  Han Dynasty in Old City is genuinely unique Chinese food, because of the heat, fresh ingredients, and because of the excellence in prep.  Han Dynasty in West Phila felt like an average meal at PF Changs, but one w. tons of spice.  The best part of the experience was the staff, they were extremely nice.  At the end of my meal, I went to the restroom, when I came back, my table was completely bare--no water, no napkin, and I had had almost 1/2 a bowl of Dan Dan noodles left.  Luckily I wasn't planning to take home any of the leftovers and was full.  I had left my bag and coat on the chair, so even a perfunctory glance at the table would have told the busser not to clear the table.  I told the waitress when she brought the check and she said she had already spoken to the busser.  It wasn't a big deal.  I think a more experienced staff might have comped something to make amends.  If I had still been hungry, I would have just insisted that the waiter bring a new order of Dan Dan noodles, I would have done this in a nice way.  I'm more prone to getting what I want in the moment, rather than harboring a grudge.  I'm willing to give it another go because I love the space but not with high hopes for above average food."

BEWARE that they already put tips on the bill without informing you about the practice; thus, naive customer like me pays more in tips.\n\nI came here with 4 friends for dinner, ordered several appetizers and 4 main items. They served all items with just one rice bowl (size same whether you are one person or group of 5 or more). When we requested for two rice bowls, the waiter declined saying that the management is okay to refill to avoid waste. Great idea!! However, you don't serve same amount of rice to group of five and group of two. If you do, make sure to check frequently when more rice is needed. We waited for 20 mins before the waiter showed up. \n\nAs far as foods are concerned, we have had better food for what they are worth. The food had spicy level in a scale of 1-10. 10 means there are just too much fried dry chili on your plate without affecting the spiciness of actual food. The food is super greasy, and I had stomach issue after eating the food. Thankfully, a trip to restroom saved me!\n\nAt the end of dinner, the waitress gave us the bill with tips included without mentioning about this practice. I usually pay ~20% tips without looking at the bill. I never like a restaurant when they impose on the customer on tips, irrespective of the service they provide. I would not come here again."

I then remembered Han Dynasty was just around the corner and decided to place a dinner order.\n\nI called and ordered Garlic Sauce Style chicken, picked it up, and opened it up in the conference room where I work.  Outside the room, I heard nurses saying \"What is that smell?  Ooh, that smells amazing!  Where is it coming from?\".  I figured they were talking about my meal, as it doesn't take much to be the most appetizing smell in a hospital.  But the taste...  A symphony, a triumph, a delight for the senses.  I won't even try to describe it, because there are no words-- just go eat it and try for yourself.\n\nThe portion was enough for 2, and I exercised great self control and saved the second half of my meal for later.  I finished work at 10am the next day, hopped in a cab home, and quickly devoured the remaining garlic goodness for a late breakfast.  Unconventional, yes.  But as I jumped into bed after being up all night, I couldn't get the thought of the small portion of the garlic chicken out of my head.  \n\nI can't wait to order it again.\n\nI didn't realize they did catering until they catered a work lunch the week prior, which had many delightful options, vegetarian and carnivorous alike.

Crispy on the outside, melts in your mouth. It was spicy, but not too spicy for me. Still, my complaint is that the plate's real estate is mostly taken up by peppers rather than chicken. After we had finished it (or rather after I had finished it.. it was a bit too spicy for my friend), the volume of peppers made the dish look untouched. The garlic style chicken was loved by all.

It's a very specific blend of noodles, spice, and a peanut flavor that people either adore or hate. The wontons tasteful and you could adjust their spiciness by dunking them in the chili oil. The kung pao chicken wasn't anything different than another restaurant so I'll probably get something else next time. \n\nMenu: the dinner menu is slightly pricier as you might expect. Most of the menu is labeled with a spice rating that can be adjusted upon request.

We were told that a 5 (out of 10) is equivalent to Sriracha sauce. Now, when I think of Sriracha, I think of putting several drops all over a dish of food. What Han Dynasty meant was, marinating/service chunks of meat/tofu in a bowl FULL of Sriracha. Long story short, it was way too hot to handle. If you are a mild-ONLY person, go 1-2. If you are a brave soul, try 3. 5 was unbelievable; do not recommend.\n\nSecond reason for docking points--I had beef noodle soup, and I wasn't a huge fan of the broth. Also there were massive chunks of cartilage still attached to my meat. That's not necessarily a deal-breaker, but the amount of edible meat was not a ton, and I think that may have contributed to the unusual taste of the broth.\n\nA fun atmosphere and nice service (especially when we had to admit to not being able to handle the 5), just not a huge fan of the food."

All 30 people that were in UC that night were at Han Dynasty, I think. \n\nIt was UC Dining Week, or whatever they call it. I ordered the dandan noodles, chicken in chili oil, and green tea ice cream. And a Tiger beer. And as expected, it was delicious. But not as expected; the portions were huge. I could've shared all three and been content. Doggy bags were necessary. \n\nDan dan noodles are my favorite food at the moment, and if a place hits that mark well, it's an automatic 4 star for me. The chicken (in chili oil) was a bit overcooked, I thought, and pretty much just sitting in chili oil next to scallions. And the green tea ice cream (that they get from Bassett's... I think) was good.  \n\nA good experience."

Kids, it's not difficult to make something spicy.  You can make anything spicy if you douse it with enough chili oil.  There is much to be said for cuisine that allows you to taste the subtle flavors of simple ingredients.  You won't find such cuisine at Han Dynasty, which is the perfect place for the \"spicier is better\" crowd.  We started with the Dan Dan Noodles, which weren't bad, but the level of spice overwhelmed the flavors of the other ingredients, so all I remember is that they were spicy.  One of my friends had some sort of chicken dish, which appeared to be chicken skin swimming in a huge bowl of chili oil.  Seriously, I don't think there was any chicken meat in the bowl.  (It was quite revolting.)  I forget what my other friend had, but she wasn't impressed either.  Not wanting a repeat of the noodles, I went with the relatively mild garlic sauce style shrimp, which was actually quite good and had real flavor rather than merely being spicy.  However, it wasn't good enough for me to want to go back.\n\nIf you love spicy food, you'll probably rate this place higher, but I want more from a dish than a burning sensation in my mouth.  I want real flavor and real flavor is in short supply at Han Dynasty."

        "text": "Summary: Good (spicy) food, decent ambiance, mixed service\n\nI've been to the original Han Dynasty in Old City, and needed to try out the UC location soon after the opening. After all, living less than three blocks away, I was ready for this to become my new staple oriental joint in UC. But the question of the hour was whether or not this location could live up to the reputation of the OC location.\n\nFood-wise? It comes pretty darned close. Spicy cucumber, dan dan noodles, and the chicken in chili oil opened the night. I can't speak to the chicken, but the cucumber and dan dan noodles (a specialty here, in case you didn't know) were both fantastic. The entrees were good as well, and having gotten the tofu in the garlic sauce style, I can say that I was reluctant to share with the other rabbit at our table (vegetarian, if you will). Garlic sauce style is described as \"Sweet, sour, and spicy. Stir fried with ginger, garlic, bamboo, wood ear mushrooms, and bell peppers.\" It just sounds awesome right there. Our group was heading out for some other stops, so we didn't get a chance to try the desserts, but I'm sure that they would have been good too. Those in our group that did imbibe in drinks did mention that they were fantastic, and that the bartender was really being liberal w/ the alcohol (yet, making them taste great!).\n\nAmbiance? This place is certainly more open, airy, and modern than the Old City location. Is it better? I don't know... the OC location will always have a special place in my heart. But I suppose that this location (located where Mid-Atlantic used to be, by the way) was made to be more trendy and in-sync with the University crowds from Drexel and UPenn. Speaking of which, it was mainly students that packed the place, meaning it was quite loud (almost excessively).\n\nNow... Service. This was a mixed bag. We had a group of 5 and had a reservation, but still had to wait almost 20-25 minutes after our reservation time. Ehh... okay (- 1 star). Once we were seated, we didn't so much see the semblance of a menu (at our table) until I flagged down the busboy who was meandering by, almost 15 minutes after we were seated. Umm... not so good (- 1 star). Even once we ordered (oddly enough, through the bartender) and got our food, nobody was coming around to refill the water and/or take further drink orders for 20 minute intervals at a time. Not good (- 1 star). Even once we got done with our entire meal, it took another 15 minutes to get the check. The only saving grace of the service was the bartender, who was trying to coordinate everything, for which I'll give back a star (+ 1 star).\n\nOverall, it's pretty close food-wise to the original, has a nice and convenient location, but due to the ambiance and lackluster service, I'd recommend ordering for take-out or delivery (I think they've started delivering to a 3 mile radius recently)."

This is great Szechuan cooking with an American twist, with constantly changing specials that knock your socks off with flavor and definitely heat. I appreciate the hot pepper number system on the menu so I can steer clear of the nuclear options. The chef will also be willing to tone it down at your request. No matter what the special, we always order the cucumbers in chili oil and the dumplings in chili oil (which are actually pretty different). It's a great value for the size of the dishes and the quality of your meal - you may have to pay for it with a burning mouth as they don't serve milk or anything else to cool you down."

Our waiter was almost intrusive and annoyed that we were there. Also, when I asked if my entree could include chicken and tofu (rather than just one or the other), I figured it wouldn't be a problem since they were the same price (even it was more, I would have paid it), but when I politely asked if that was possible he replied with, \"No.\" just like that. Nothing like, \"Let me check with the kitchen\" or \"Probably but it might cost more\" nothing like that. Just a simple, \"No.\" really? Ok. That's fine. Tofu it is.

        "text": "I have now been to this restaurant 4 times in the last three weeks. Being someone who doesn't generally eat Chinese food, this should be impressive enough.\n\nI'll start with the fact that, unlike the Old City location, the University City Han has a full bar. What's more, they keep a rotating tap of some EXCELLENT beers, including Allaghash Black and Ommegang Three Philosophers, along with some lighter selections. If you're REALLY lucky, you'll chance upon one of their special collaborations with Voodoo Brewing Company, in which the brewer uses Han's szechuan peppercorns during the brewing process. Thanks to the amazing management, I was lucky enough to score a seat at a tasting dinner with the Master Brewer at Voodoo last night, where he introduced these special edition beers. Mind. Blown.\n\nThe service is excellent. At the bar, a very attentive bartender will help you with your beer/wine/drink selection. The waitstaff is extremely attentive. Once your order is taken, be prepared, because the food will come out quick and hot. They serve seemingly immediately after preparation, making the food taste hot and fresh, and, possibly due to an extremely efficient kitchen, the food USUALLY comes out within five or ten minutes of ordering. For me, this is a plus, but knowing people who don't like to rush dinner, I think you should be prepared for a relatively quick (1 to 1.5 hour) meal. Those looking for a longer, slower experience might want to look elsewhere.\n\nGiven the restaurant's specific spice rating scale (1-10), some assistance is also needed with ordering, and the excellent waitstaff is more than happy to let you know how much to order, describe the dishes and specials, and outline what to expect in terms of heat with each dish.\n\nFoodwise, this is easily the best Szechuan food I've ever had. This has been belabored ad nauseum in the glaringly positive reviews on Yelp so far, so I'll just add my highlights:\n\n-Dan dan noodles (obviously)\n-Dry Pepper Style anything (crispy fish is probably my favorite) - At an 8/10, this is, to me, the perfect spiciness. Overpowering, but not to the point of loss of flavor.\n-For something less spicy, try the Salt and Pepper Style Scallops.\n-Cumin Lamb\n-Wontons in Chili Oil - Again, perfect amount of heat.\n\nIn all, try to push your limits a little with the spiciness. Han's style of cooking is such that, although spicy, the food never looses its amazing szechuan peppercorn flavoring."

It's a simple dish yet I think they tried to improve on it and made it worse. It had a strong taste of cooking wine, which maybe some people like but since I was expecting something else I wasn't very happy with it. \n\nOtherwise, everything else was good. Full size portions were definitely filling, and we did family-style and shared our dishes. (They also have lunch size portions at 60% of the full portion for 60% of the price.) Service was good.

Prices are affordable and portion sizes are decent as well.\n\nI always order my staple favorites-- vegetable Dan Dan noodles, scallion pancakes, and the Kung Pao style tofu. I've also tried the hot sauce style tofu, which was incredible but not as incredible as the Kung Pao style tofu. I wasn't a huge fan of the garlic style tofu, so I haven't ordered it again since the first time I tried it (though I do know others who swear by it). The Dan Dan noodles are absolutely incredible. Such a seemingly simplistic recipe-- the vegetable Dan Dan noodles are literally just noodles with a spicy peanuty sauce (downside is vegetable Dan Dan noodles don't come with any sort of protein, like tofu) but I honestly always find myself craving these noodles. Another great part about the Han Dynasty dining experience is the ability to customize your order depending on spice level. Their dishes follow a 1 to 10 scale, 1 being extremely mild and 10 being extremely hot (caution: very, very spicy). Their dishes come with a suggested spice number, but you can always change it. I usually stick with a 7 for the vegetable Dan Dan noodles and it is extremely, EXTREMELY spicy for me but that's the way I love experiencing the explosion of flavors.\n\nThe dine-in experience is smooth and memorable. Waitresses and waiters are friendly and genuine; sometimes they'll talk to you about your specific tastes and food preferences before suggesting dishes off of the menu according to your likes and dislikes. Their delivery service is great as well-- my friends and I don't mind paying the small delivery fee (~$4) for fairly fast service and decent portion sizes. \n\nDefinitely recommend hitting up Han Dynasty if you are in the University City area.

I heard about it every time someone checked-in on Yelp, someone on twitter would inevitably say \"don't forget the dan dan\", I also followed Foobooz and Eater as Old City expanded to University City to Exton, Royersford, Manayunk and New Jersey and yet for whatever reason there I was still just a spectator. I'm not sure how I allowed opportunity after opportunity to slip by, but finally the time was right. I now found myself excited yet absolutely terrified by the menu that sat in front of me...the numbers indicating the spice level of intensity taunting me, calling me a \"weenie\" for being nervous. I quelled my nerves with a Xiaogui Gimlet of gin and grapefruit juice while seated at the bar with the rest of those in our party and eyed the offerings debating whether I could man-up enough to go for the (10). \n\nWe were seated shortly after receiving our drinks, our tabs moved to the tables bill and once seated six mouths went flying....\"we should order this\", \"oh, no that sounds great\", \"tea smoked duck? intriguing!\" Somewhere amongst the chaos of discussion we wound up settling on dan dan noodles, spicy crispy cucumbers, dry pot pork,  tea smoked duck, pea shoots in garlic.. No sooner had we ordered but dishes started to make their way to the table, it was now or never to put on my game face and brace for the sting. The dan dan noodles, awesome. The spicy crispy cucumbers, hot yet cool, a confusing feeling of sorts. Next came our level (10) dishes and the anxiety started to mount, dishes were passed around, chopsticks in place, I dug in without really even thinking. The tea smoked duck was amazing, as was the dry pot; both were of a spice intensity I had never experienced before, but could not stop picking. The dry pot was served in a hot pot sauce in a little wok with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, peppercorns, and peppers. Out of everything we ate though, I think the winner for me was the side order of pea shoots; simply ordered because none of us had every had them before, this simple little green in a light garlic sauce was what grounded the spice of the rest of the entrees and even some of the appetizers; a perfect contrast to the majority of our meal.\n\nDinner moved fast, food is brought out as it's cooked and because it's prepared so quickly at such a high heat we were in and out in just a little under an hour and a half.  We didn't feel rushed and for as much as I think I ate, didn't leave feeling overstuffed...perfect for post-dinner cocktails as we migrated over toward Old City to end the night. No one spent more than $25 including a cocktail apiece. Ordering a few appetizers and entrees for a larger table was a great move as everything is served in share size portions and was definitely a great way to experience this restaurant for the first time.\n\nWill I be back? Well, my mouth was ready for a round two just a few minutes after leaving from dinner, I would expect to be making a second, third, and fourth visit very soon or at the very least making a trip for some takeout."

The waitress who was taking care of us was so helpful in all aspects. After many unexpected attendees, she quickly helped to get us settled in two tables of 12 - far surpassing the number I had reserved for. She continued to go above and beyond and helped keep our cake hidden, refrigerated, and even saved the container in case we didn't finish (which we didn't).  She put the cake back into my cooler and stored it until we were ready to leave. WOW. I'm honestly not too impressed by a lot of the customer service in the University City/Center City area, but she was truly amazing! If you're looking to throw a  party - look no further! \n\nFood - AMAZING. I must admit, it has taken me a couple years for me to slowly get used to it, but this time around I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of the food. A fair warning though, Han Dynasty is not for the faint-hearted. Most of their dishes are quite spicy, even at a lower spice level. The dishes that are a MUST include:\n- Pork Belly w/ Sweet Garlic Chili Oil Sauce ($9.95)\n     Pricy appetizer, but well worth it - even for a cheap college student!\n- Fish in Hot Sauce Style ($18.95)\n    We tried this on a whim, and this was hands down the best dish of the day!

The salt and pepper shrimp was light and crispy with a kick from the combined fried chilies. And the crispy rice style chicken was a dish we never had where they take a puffed rice and pour the hot dish over it to bring the flavors to life.

The food is excellent for the price if you order the right things, however some of the meat/spice combos just don't work as well together as others. The dan dan noodles are great, as is the black bean fish and double-cooked style chicken. I've found the service to usually be top-notch. It's a great place to take vegetarians or people with allergies, as they are very accommodating. The prices are very good for the amount of food. For two people I usually order dan dan noodles, one small appetizer and an entree, and we're left with food to take home. It usually ends up only costing around $15 per person."

The restaurant itself looks nice, has a liquor licence, so it's an appropriate spot for business meals.\n\nHan Dynasty excels in certain dishes and does a passable job on the rest -- I've graded some of their dishes for easy reference.

For a table of 12 or so, they only gave us a pretty small serving bowl of rice, so we finished it quickly and had to wait to get more. Maybe it'd make more sense if they just brought out 2 serving bowls of rice for such a large table.\n\nDelivery-wise, the service was lacking. Although I had placed a large order a day in advance, delivery was late and they didn't have all the food I'd ordered. They called me last-minute to say they'd run out of steamed brown rice. On top of it all, they didn't provide any plates/cutlery to eat with.

I could go three because of the service but the price, quality and taste just didn't meet the hype of the other reviews.  The bartender was excellent as I was dining alone and he described the family style service and made a recommendation based on our discussion.  I shared I don't like spicy food. First mistake is that you can't believe anyone who likes spicy food when they say, \"try level 2, it's not that spicy.\" I appreciated the effort but still too hot for me. \n\nPork dumplings were not the \"traditional\" American dumpling I believe most people are used to (example such as those served at PF Chang).  They were flat dough with a little pork in the middle.  They was flat like a pancake!  However the flavor, although spicy, actually had a good flavor - just too much dough.  I order the broiled fish in vegetable dish(can't remember the name).  The fish was ok but it was drowned in greasy oil with over cooked AND under cooked vegetables.  \n\nI can't recommend this based on flavor and quality of food, but go with friends and give it a try.

Every dish is consistently made well although I recommend ordering different styles and sauces as a lot of the food ends up tasting the same if choosing similar dishes.\nI love the three cup chicken (stir fried chicken cubes with whole garlic cloves doused in a lightly sweet dark sauce).\nI also recommend the dan dan noodles (noodles stirred in a peanut butter soy sauce base with some ground beef/pork and spices) as it can serve as your carb base versus white rice which they do bring out with the meat or veggie dishes. I highly recommend getting 2 or 3 spice level for those who cant handle spices that well like me.

Of the menu items, I recommend the dan dan noodles, the twice fried (insert protein here, but I like the fish), and the eggplants. The food that didn't live up to expectation were the pork buns (really dry meat), the rabbit w/peanuts (which was more like peanut with rabbit bones) appetizer, and the dumplings in chili oil (more carbs than protein). The other dishes, like the bak choy and mapu tofu were standard.\n\nOne of the main reason why I was disappointed at Han Dynasty was the lack of communication between the staff for large party organizations. I called ahead 1 month in advance to prepare a dinner with specific food and spices request due to individual preferences. When I arrived on that evening, the waiter had no idea of the previous arrangement, and I spent 15 minutes trying to re-order the entire menu and we ended up getting multiple dishes with the wrong level of spices and excessive amount of meat dishes even though we had multiple vegetarians in our group.\n\nI think at the end of the day Han Dynasty isn't bad, but if you're trying to impress a native Chinese foodie, there is much room for improvement.\n\nFood: 3 stars\nPrice: 3 stars\nService: 2 stars\nAmbiance: 2 stars (very stuffy, despite the tall ceilings)"

For meals we had lo mein, the dumplings, spicy dry pot and soup. They were all amazing! Things tend to be on the spicy side so if you want something not to spicey be sure to tell the waiter!"

I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table (even for a large group) or more than 20 for my food after ordering. It is diverse. I know I can go the more adventurous route with some of their more authentic dishes (which focus predominantly on Szechuan cuisine but include also some Taiwanese and Hunan style dishes) , but I can also guiltily order my scallion pancakes and sweet and sour chicken if I want to. It is generous. Portions are family style, bottomless rice is included and tea! This makes for a very happy me.\n\nFor a first timer, I would recommend going in a large group and getting the tasting menu. Set your preferred spice level and inform your waiter of dietary restrictions and preferences- they will do the rest. You get a ton of food for a great price and to try dishes you might not otherwise have ordered (Shrimp with Honey and Walnuts?). Have a good time with your friends and go home stuffed! My favorite dishes include the cucumbers in chili oil, Three Cup Chicken, Eggplant with Garlic, Scallion Style anything, and the cold sesame noodles. See too many things you want to order? Go for it. Leftovers are the best."

The rest of the staff was also very friendly. The interior of the restaurant looks nice, with an open kitchen and a lot of natural light. The weather was really nice and they let agreed us sit outside.\n\nThe spiciness of the food here is no joke. They do rate the spiciness of each dish on a 1-10 scale, but it was hard to tell where I stood as a first-timer, even with the server's suggestions. We ended up having the Dan Dan Noodles (a 6 or 8) and Garlic Sauce Style Chicken (3), which came with rice. The chicken dish was good, but I would probably try something else next time. The Dan Dan noodles were super spicy, but SO delicious! I would definitely get them again. \n\nPortion-wise, both dishes I had could easily feed 2 people... maybe 3, if you take into account the 4-5 glasses of water each person needs to drink to put out the fire that the food will set in your mouth."

Verdict: phenomenal Schezuan food in a surprisingly trendy environment! This is a totally new concept to me because the tastiest and most authentic Asian food back home is usually found in hole-in-the-wall shops, not in poppin' ambiances like that of Han Dynasty. Honestly, I am so glad they dragged me here because it was incredible. \n\n*Dan Dan Noodles* - Went by popular choice and ordered it, albeit at a lower spice level (Level 3 instead of Level 7). Spicy, saucy, peanut-y goodness with ample amounts of ground pork and sprinkled with scallions! I couldn't stop slurping these. \n\n*Three Cup Chicken* - A very traditional Taiwanese dish and so freaking good. Deeply-flavored, crispy dark meat chicken in a slightly sweet sauce. We didn't see this at first because it's not on the main entree list but under Specials. Our friend recommended that we try it and it was amazing. Highly recommend it!!\n\n*Fish in Hot Sauce Style*-  Heart-warming and delicious without being overwhelmingly oily, MSG-y, or too spicy. I was so happy about that. Also, glad that the cabbage and celery portions were plentiful.\n\n*Pork Dumplings* - My least favorite of the food, but not bad-tasting. Dough:filling ratio was not on point. While the tasty filling was simple, seasoned ground pork (no scallions or cabbage or anything), the wrapping was too doughy and thick for me. \n\nWe shared among a group of four and had ample amounts of food left. I'm so glad that I was able to enjoy the traditional 'ma-la' flavor of Szechuan food without dying from bouts of MSG at this Philly favorite. I'll have cravings for this place."

It's not to say that it's bad but the taste and flavor are definitely geared more towards American tastes. I'm not saying that's necessarily a bad thing either (after all we are in America and the people coming here are American, for the most part), but when people say that this is authentic Sichuan Chinese food to me even when they've either never lived or visited Sichuan, then I get skeptical. This was one of those times. \n\nThe food leaned more on the bland side (in comparison to more authentic Chinese fare) and they used certain ingredients that I'd never see in a Chinese dish. Some of the dishes we ordered were decent, if not lacking in the spicy department.\n\nThe decor was definitely more modern and had a Asian fusion flare to it (did not feel Chinese at all) and the service was prompt (even if towards the end they seemed very eager to kick us out).\n\nI'd suggest making reservations if you decide to go because it does get pretty busy and the wait can lean close to 45 mins.\n\nAll in all, this was a good place if your group is a bit more diversified from other cultures because it's \"safer\" than going all in to a more authentic Sichuan Chinese restaurant. Otherwise, I'd suggest going to Chinatown and checking out one of their hole-in-the-wall locations for some spice.\n\nParking: Limited street parking or paid lot\nPrice: $20/person\nWait: 15+ mins to be seated"

This is definitely one of the best restaurants in the University City area.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n\nDumplings in chili oil: These are actually one of the dishes I don't like quite as much; the oil does overpower the dumplings a little bit. Still, the dumplings themselves are very well executed; the pastry and the meat are in the right proportion, and the meat is flavorful and tasty.\n\nSpicy cucumbers: Delicious. The sweetness and crispness of the cukes goes very nicely with the chili oil's heat. I like this one a lot.\n\nTaiwanese sausage: Sweet and savory together. I had never had a sausage quite like this, but I loved the sweet flavoring. It went well with the spicier dishes that I ordered alongside it. I'll get this again on my next visit.\n\nPork belly with garlic and chili oil: A good dish, although I (perhaps foolishly) expected it to be served hot, not cold. The meat was well cooked, and while the chili oil was maybe a touch strong, it still worked well. Combined with the fresh white rice, it was nicely done.\n\nSOUPS:\n\nWonton soup: hot, albeit slightly bland, broth, and excellent dumplings that are plump, juicy, and tasty. Very good flavor with these dumplings; I'm a big fan.\n\nPickled vegetable and flounder: The vegetables themselves are a bit too sour and were slightly overcooked, but the flounder was flaky, delicate, and tasted great. The soup itself was maybe a bit spicier than I would have liked for this dish, though; it was only rated a 2, but it tasted spicier than that.\n\nNOODLES AND RICE:\n\nHouse fried rice: Light, fluffy, with nicely cooked pork, chicken, and shrimp. Really well done. Comparable to the best of the other Chinese restaurants in the area.\n\nDan-dan noodles: Deliciously spicy, with just the right amount of chew to the noodles. The minced pork didn't really do much for me, but it wasn't offensive either. I really liked this; it was different from what you can usually get in Philadelphia, and tasted great to boot.\n\nENTREES:\n\nThree-cup chicken: Savory chicken in a sweet sauce. Delicious, and contrasted nicely with the other (hot!) dishes on offer. One of my favorite dishes in the restaurant.\n\n\nOverall, despite a few hiccups here and there, I really like this restaurant. 4 stars!"

We skipped our usual orders this time, but if you're going for the first time, go for:\n\nDumplings (or Wontons) in Chili Oil\nDan Dan Noodles\nCumin Lamb\nThree Cup Chicken (*not spicy)\n*Yes, this is a restaurant where you need to call out the dishes that are not spicy. \n\nTo put it simply. Han Dynasty is as good as it gets for food in Philly. There is no other place with the combination of quality, flavor, variety, authenticity, and value. Not even close."

Though I'm not even a big fan of Asian food in general, I was very pleased with my experience!\n\nThe setup of this restaurant is really modern, clean, and chic. We were seated in a back corner, as we had quite a few people, at a family-style round table. The restaurant easily accommodated our few latecomers. Our server was upbeat, knowledgeable about the menu, and ensured our waters were filled throughout our time there. \n\nI ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, a Han Dynasty classic. However, our server informed me that they were made with meat... but then told me that he could specifically make them vegetarian for me, which he did! And they were awesome. This HUGE portion (seriously, I was able to eat it for dinner that night and lunch and dinner the next day) was spicy and peppery as claimed, perfectly cooked, and incredibly flavorful. All of my friends were pleased with their dishes too.\n\nThe staff was cordial enough to take a photo of our group for me at the end of our meal, too, which I appreciate... it's actually ridiculously hard to find waitstaff willing to do that without complaining or denying you.\n\nJust a note: when you're going in for lunch, make sure to ask for a lunch portion--you still get a pretty hefty meal, and for only half the price!"

The  menu is extensive with enough choices to come over and over again and not have the same thing again...though you'll probably go back to your faves!  Last visit, we ordered:\nSpicy beef noodle soup, Wonton soup, and DanDan noodles to start the meal. The spicy beef soup was UNREAL.  Rated a 5 on the spice scale, it had a bit of kick but nothing we couldn't handle.  The flavors were intense and delicious.  Wonton was top notch light broth and scallions, with delicate wontons that melted in your mouth.  Pleae note soups serve 2-3 people.  The DanDan noodles are a MUST get when you visit. I'll leave it at that. Yum! For our entrees Kung Pao chicken with crunchy bits of hot peppers, Salt and Pepper batter shrimp (large and tasy), and Chinese eggplant.  All so good.

This used to be one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in the UCity area, and I would get take out from here ~twice a week. However, I have started coming here less (see below for why):\n\nPros\nFlexible menu\n\nMore authentic than your average Chinese food place around here \n\nGood happy hour and ambiance\n\nThe manager is very friendly and helpful. I had a few orders catered to my office for events, and the orders were very well executed.\n\n**Lunch size portions from 1130-3pm that are more manageable sizes and cheaper\n\nCons\nVery very oily food - as in, swimming in oil. I ask for my food with less oil now but I think the chef just laughs at the order and ignores it\n\nMy favorite dish used to be the long hot pepper pork (I would order it a little spicier than it comes on the menu). However in the past few months I have noticed a significant reduction in the quality of their pork - a few times I ordered it, it was so fatty it was practically inedible and I wound up picking most of the pork out and eating the veggies and rice. I am thinking that their either changed suppliers to cut down costs, or there was a change of personnel in the kitchen. Either way, it's noticeable. \n\nDishes you should still try:\nspicy cucumbers (so so yummy)\nCold sesame noodles (another winner)\nDan dan noodles\npea leaves with garlic"

The great thing about this place is that you can customize the spice level. The Dan Dan style noodles were great, not too spicy but still great flavor. The Hot Sauce Style chicken was amazing. The chicken was so well cooked, and the schezuan pepper oil left a slight numbness in the mouth after each bite. My mouth is watering thinking about it right now!!

Since it just opened, it wasn't hard to get a seating for a group of 8. \n\nWhat further enhanced our experience was the food--everything was prepared pretty well (though they ran out of wontons in chili oil and substituted it with dumplings instead). Three Cup Chicken was not overcooked (something that happens at the Olde City location, as reported by my friend). Of course, Dan Dan Noodles were off the hook! 3 orders of the noodles, plus 2 meat dishes, and an appetizer was enough to fill 8 hungry stomaches.\n\nStaff was fine.

As others have noted, dan dan noodles and spicy cucumbers are soooo good, they are our favorite appetizers!! Among main dishes, eggplant, mapo tofu are all good but the dish that I really love is dry pot tofu! Cumin style tofu is really tasty too.

They offer EVERYTHING on their menu as gluten free. I personally loveeeeee rice noodles so I was all about sharing with him. \n\nMy favorite apps: dan dan noodles, spicy crispy cucumbers, dumplings in chili oil. I certainly eat more than most people but dining with three people, this is PLENTY. Everything on their menu is sharing style so don't come with your picky friends (we all have some).\n\nAll of the hot pots are exceptional. To date, my favorite was one we ordered off of the special menu..................................... Sorry I was just wiping the drool off of my face. Half kidding.\n\nWe ordered pork shoulder in a spicy brown sauce filled with bok choy, eggplant, green beans, and other veggies. The pork was crispy on the outer layer and just the right amount of juicy fat. It was so succulent and literally fell off the bone\n\nBetween three of us, we no where near finished.

We couldn't even find our waiter to order more drinks, we were going to get a lot more alcohol. His job was done once he dropped that food off in his mind. We found him about 45 minutes later and asked for the bill. Also when we initially got there we were seated, but the waiter never came over. About a half hour later I walked over and asked if we had a waiter yet and they said oh I'm sorry I will go ahead and get you one. So apart from service everything was great.

I also really enjoy the dumplings in chili oil, which are unlike dumplings I've had before. I've also had a number of their other dishes and vegetables, and each time they've been really good - it just depends on what you're in the mood for.

We decided to start with drinks...while we both wanted to order a safer beer like Tsingtao, we chose to be a bit more daring and ordered some kind of raspberry beer because it sounded refreshing. BAD choice. It was NOT what either of us expected...very sweet. Blegh! Well, we finished it but didn't order it again. \n\nWhat we ordered were the Chicken Hot Pot and Dry Pepper Chicken. Our server let us know that while the Chicken Hot Pot notes that 10 is the spiciest level, it really isn't that spicy...more like a 7. I appreciated that note because I was going to drop it down to a 7 (which according to his recommendation would have been a 4). It was the perfect level of spicy. The food was delicious, of course. There were leftovers so they wrapped them up for us. \n\nI understand that they don't need anymore reviews, since they're a pretty big chain. BUT whatever.

I could go for some dan dan noodles\".  Then the craving starts to grow.  I start re-reading the menu online while at work, hoping the words on the screen will soothe my burning desire.  I'll start thinking about them at inappropriate times, like while brushing my teeth in the morning or while in a boring meeting at 2 pm in the afternoon.  The craving will overtake me until I give in.  Now if you have a similar experience, I suggest that you visit the U City location when this happens.\n\nHaving been to the Old City location, I did a major comparison of it to the U City location.  The food (price, quality, portion) is identical, but the atmosphere is much different.  I really like the size of this location.  They have a really nice outdoor patio with tons, and I mean TONS, of seating.  And the inside is equally as large.  There is free parking after 5 during the week and all day on the weekends. And they have a full bar with decently priced drinks.\n\nFor those of you who are Han NOOBS, you gotta go with the dan dan noodles, dumplings in chili oil, and crispy cucumbers.  On this particular visit, we tried the (mild) veggie dumplings which didn't impress me so much, but gave us a much needed relief from the more fiery items we ordered.  As far as portions are concerned, Mmy husband and I always get 4 items and have plenty leftover for lunch the next day.\n\nI would suggest Han's U City location if you are looking to eat with a large group of friends- they have the space for it and the free parking makes it easy for people to congregate there from all over the city and beyond.  If you are looking to get a bite before a night out, the Old City location may be more of what you are looking for since U City is a bit isolated."

But what was surprising -- and an utter disappointment-- was the lack of  acknowledgement from any host or hostess. There was no one to take down a name or to at least communicate the waiting time. Zero acknowledgment and information provided. whatsoever.\n\nVery disorganized of a restaurant compounded with a lack of communication. Even though I did not try their food, I don't think I'll ever come back."

We have dined in twice, once during the \"soft tofu\" opening and once after they added the full bar. It is also convenient for me to grab take out from on the way home, answering all my sesame noodle desires. Parking at this location is much easier than in old city or manyunck, they have a free on site garage for dinner time and there are a lot of free or metered spaces available in the area. \n\nAs with all locations, you can't go and not order the noodles and cucumbers. Other favorites include the pea leaves, eggplant, garlic sauce style, cumin style and double cooked style."

It was a tinge on the salty side but the chicken was perfectly cooked and the flavors were delicious. We also had the scallion pancake which was simple and came with a really good chili dipping sauce. Their spring rolls had a pretty boring cabbage and carrot filling, nothing spectacular.

I was delightfully surprised that despite being a chain restaurant, Han Dynasty's Sichuan cuisine was among the most authentic I have ever had. It was very spicy, and numbing spices were also obviously used. Everything was very flavorful and not too salty.\n\nI came here recently after having not been for about two years, and was slightly disappointed. We ordered spicy crispy cucumber (has always been a favorite of mine), dumplings in chili oil, scallion pancake, dry pot style chicken (spiciness level=9), and shredded pork with pressed tofu. The dishes came out rather quickly (their service has always been quite good).\n\nAs I mentioned, the spicy crispy cucumber has always been one of my favorite dishes, and I'd order it almost every time. I didn't like it this time because the chili oil/broth/not sure what to call it is seasoned in was much sweeter than usual and not as spicy and garlic flavored as it once was. The dry pot style chicken was ordered at a spiciness of 9/10, which I expected to be quite spicy from my previous experiences (I've ordered something at a 7 before that was still very spicy) but it was not spicy at all. The chili oil that the wontons came in was also not as flavorful, and the scallion pancakes are definitely not the best I've ever had. They were very dry and lacked any scallion flavor (if you're looking for a good scallion pancake, go to Sakura in Chinatown). Honestly, I am wondering if they changed the amount of spice that corresponds to each level because their clientele is mostly Caucasian Penn/Drexel/Hospital faculty/staff. Every time I have been here, there has been maybe one or two tables of Asian customers (usually students) and the rest were Caucasian. This is especially true for the summer when most students are not on campus. \n\nI am giving Han Dynasty a 4/5 because I think that it is unfair to give only 3 stars as I am judging from my previous experiences. They are usually very good, and the dishes I ordered this time were also good--just not AS good. I still would recommend Han Dynasty to everyone I know who enjoys spicy and Asian food."

The spicyness has been toned down for the wider audience and the drinks will never be worth it, but it's still the best Chinese food in a ten block radius. Their signature dan-dan noodles (pork in a creamy peanut sauce sprinkled with fresh scallions) are always going to be delicious and there's no other place I'd really trust to serve fresh fish around University City. \n\nGet the cumin anything if you're into a softer, melt-in-your mouth experience and the dry hot pot if you're looking for something chewier. The kung pao chicken is a little bit less crunchy than I'd prefer, but still a spiritual experience. Most of the spices here are of the \"wet\" variety and not the mouth-numbing \"dry\" variety, so if that's what you're looking for you'll need someplace more hole in the wall. \n\nThe lunch special is a super solid deal if you've got the free time (they'll let you take it to go if you plead enough). Overall, 4/5 stars. Not completely life changing but still a great way to spend dinner with friends and an even better place to grab a reasonably priced lunch to go."

I was looking forward to the warm east Asian aesthetic on a cold winters night. Unfortunately, while there were some of those touches, the interior leaned heavily on oppressive industrial overtones instead. \n\nWhen seated the table was fine but the chairs were uncomfortable. We expected to be able to get a cocktail at a similarly located bar near or around the restaurant but because Dynasty is in the middle of the university campus there is literally nothing around it.\n\nWhen seated the service was attentive and the food was incredibly fast to arrive. I knew it was family style but I didn't realize everything down to the soup was family style. I would not go again with less than 3 people.\n\nWe ordered a beef noodle soup off the extensive menu. It caused my mouth to go numb and tasted like your were eating straight coriander. We asked the server why and she explained the function of a peppercorn in the soup was to numb your mouth so to enable your ability to eat spicier foods. This would have been good to know before ordering it.

We were a little early for dinner as it was about 5:30 so the place was pretty empty...but it picked up quickly so I'm glad we were early.\nThe staff was really friendly and explained to us that it was family style Chinese so we were best picking a bunch of stuff to share...which is perfect, that's my favorite was to order food. The server also warned us that this would be more traditional Chinese and could be very spicy, but could also be adjusted to our tastes. The menu had spice guidelines and we agreed not to go above a five (out of ten). I generally do not like spicy...but I could handle the level five just fine as we were eating, but I only sampled smaller amounts of the spicier dishes and probably wouldn't have been able to handle the whole portion spice-wise.\nAnyway...on to the specifics...we ordered Dan Dan noodles first. These were amazing. It was like a lo mein noodle texture in a slightly spicy sauce with some pork mixed in. My second favorite was probably the garlic chicken. The garlic sauce was really good and tasted freshly made. We also had Kung pow chicken, pickled chili fish and dumplings. Everything tasted fresh and not gross and greasy like Chinese food can be sometimes. I've never experienced a Chinese restaurant like this and am already wondering where I can get Dan Dan noodles in south Florida. \nOn a final note we were all super stuffed, had leftovers,  and the check was only $80. Five people eating that much food of that quality usually comes to much more...Han dynasty has won me over."

The happy hour specials are a great deal (if you like the selections offered) - $3 beers, $4 wines, and $5 cocktails.  I tried the two beers, and both were good (though I certainly liked one more than the other).  I presume the food is as good here as at the Old City location, though I didn't get to try it this time.  It was fairly packed -- certainly to a greater extent than I ever saw Mid-Atlantic filled (which was the previous occupant of the space), which seemed like a good indicator.  Also, the dishes I saw the staff walk by with looked yummy.\n\nThe layout is eye-pleasing -- with lots of wood and warm light -- and sensible -- with a mix of small tables and group tables, as well as a whole bar area.  Definitely worth a return visit for a fuller experience; if I'm in the area."

I usually do get it with the meat topping but my friend doesn't eat meat so there's none in my photos -still delicious. They give the spicy levels on the side in red but you can adjust them to any scale 0-10 since food is made to order. Stuff comes out very quick and rice sides are unlimited. \n\nMy personal favorite is the black bean fish but I generally like everything they sell here.

The service is hit or miss, sometimes you get someone who is very attentive and other times, you they only kind of visit you, but never bad. My go to order is the Dry Pepper Style fish or tofu and for the appetizer, the Dan Dan Noodles. What's great about this place is that you can adjust the spice level to you liking; they have a scale from 1-10, 10 being the hottest. The Dry Pepper Style is (8) and the Dan Dan Noodles come at a (6) [you can also get the meat on the side as we did!]. Every table gets unlimited rice, which the servers will refill as often as you need to, but only if your current rice bowl is empty. Also, a great beer that they serve here is Lucky Buddha, and it comes in a cute green, buddha shaped bottle, which we usually get but didn't this time."

However, the last time I was here, which was a couple weeks ago, the experience was memorable but not because of the food. The food was once again delicious like last time. Some of the best asian food I've had. The service on the other hand was very unprofessional. I was with my mom and sister waiting for my other sister to arrive while the bus boy, I guess you would call him, tried to take our fourth place setting away, without asking if anyone else was joining us. We were still waiting on my other sister to arrive. When I told him this he rolled his eyes and said under his breath, \"I guess she's invisible\". I would have said something if my jaw wasn't on the floor and I also didn't want to have to worry about him spitting in my food. When the waiter came over he asked for our drink order and my mom told him what she wanted. He didn't even look up and then walked away! We had to flag him down to give us the other three drink orders! Every encounter from that moment on was so uncomfortable. He acted like he hated us and hated his life. Sorry buddy, but that's not our fault! He didn't seem to care how our food was either or if we needed more refills. He was honestly one of the most awkward and uncomfortable servers I've ever had and I felt like we were asking him for a favor when we finally got a hold of him. I know that some people are definitely more outgoing then others but if you're socially awkward you probably shouldn't be waiting tables! Next time I go here, it will be for take out!"

I will stick to Chinatown restaurants for Chinese food.\n\nOrdered an appetizer, entree, and vegetable, and I'm convinced someone dumped a couple tablespoons of salt in each dish. Dish was remade, but still very salty. Service was not terrible, but not great. Would be nice if the hostess greets you and says, \"one moment\" instead of standing there and then walking off. I've never worked in customer service, but this seems like a no brainer. And we were also billed twice and needed it corrected... \n\nI actually visited a couple other times because I do believe in second chances. The food was better and service still not great.

I remember it being way to spicy for my taste at the time, but since then my spice tolerance has grown so much thanks to all the cool foodies I know who forced me to embrace the spice lol\n\nI took the family here for Mother's Day because I knew everyone in that area of University city would be out of town, so the restaurant wouldn't be overly crowded or marking up the price that day.\n\nWe were told all the food is served family style so 3-4 dishes should feed 7-8 ppl which was pretty accurate. The host said rice comes out unlimited, but the only tedious thing was having to constantly ask for it instead of them bringing it out as we finished or just bring out one super huge bowl. We are professional rice eaters in my family, and I don't think Han Dynasty was prepared for that. \n\nWe ordered the Scallion pancakes,Dan Dan Noodle,  Pepper Chicken , on Black Bean Style Fish, and one Garlic Tofu dish. All were solid, but the  Black Bean style fish was by far the best. The flavor was so sweet and spicy all at once and the fish was super moist. The cold Dan Dan noodles packed ALOT of spice and flavor as well. I wish I could take that sauce on the noodles home and pour it on everything...except cereal of course.\n\nAnyway, the food was a home run here and the price point was way lower than we all expected.

The one familiarity, the deep savory smell of delicious Sichuan food a-cooking!\n\nThe ambiance is meant for University City - slick, young, and fast.  Modern Asian with generic attempts at urban edginess. Props to Han for the fire pit out in the seating area in front of the restaurant.  \n\nThe service was friendly but not the same type of server at the Old City location.  The waitstaff at this location proved to be a bit more green by forgetting two of our requests.  While they were upbeat and meant well, I was sorely disappointed by their lack of knowledge about the cuisine.  When asked why the dish was called \"dry pot\" style, the waiter responded \"I really don't know, my best guess is because it has dry peppers and is made in a pot.\"  Even if that is the right answer, customers shouldn't receive a best guess.  Thus my docking the restaurant a point.  Even though Han has never been known for his bedside manner, he has always prioritized the food and his waitstaff should do the same.\n\nThe food is scrumptious and consistent with the other locations.  My recommendations are unfortunately generic - beef and tripe in chili oil and the dan dan noodles.  Stick with the authentic dishes and you can't go wrong.  I will say that I am not a fan of the americanized Chinese dishes, finding them too sweet.  As a whole, the food is a bit small portioned for its price.\n\nRandom thought - While the ornate metal tea pots are beautiful, I don't know that it is enough to compensate for how difficult they are to maneuver."

Dan Dan Noodles are a subject of daydreams at work...\n\nService at this location is friendly and efficient.  Food comes out fast, but it's always busy there so the turnover keeps it fresh.  The portion sizes are huge so come hungry.  Additionally, they have some solid beers on tap.  Nothing like two pints of Dale 's Pale Ale on tap with your spicy Cumin Chicken.\n\nTwo issues that keep this place from finding hip, Chinese perfection:\n\n1) consistency of spice level.

Lets start with the ambience, it's a casual sleek modern interior and there's a solid indie to classic rock playlist in the background. The service is amazing and fast. For starters the Dan Dan noodles are a must, but its fun to venture out and try some different stuff like szechaun pickled vegetables. \n\nFor your main, it's family style but I often order one all to myself (especially at lunch when they have the incredible lunch special for 8.95!!!). I implore newbies to please be adventurous here. The first time I went I got some familiar kung pao...but after venturing out iv'e found out that ive been missing out on incredible szechaun cuisine my whole life. MUST TRY'S- the double cooked pork belly, it's honestly orgasmic, the dry fry beef, incredible. Any of the dry pot-especially pork is amazing.\n\nIf you ever run into their amazing and charismatic owner Han Chiang, then you're in for a real treat.

From the beginning, Nick, our point of contact, was extremely communicative and accommodating in helping create a menu for the party.

Nick and the rest of the team at Han Dynasty were so quick to craft a vegan menu that was not only the perfect amount for the 50 people who attended the party, but delicious and extremely affordable. And they were BY FAR the quickest to respond and friendliest. Every single person at the party, vegan or not, could not stop talking about how delicious the food was. Nick arrived with the food at the location of the party at the exact time he said he would and helped set up quickly and then emailed us the next day to check in and make sure everything went smoothly, and even congratulated us on our engagement.\n\nWe are extremely grateful for Nick and the rest of the team at Han Dynasty and will recommend them for any future party and event. \nThank you guys so much!"

After a long flight from across the country, being frustrated with TSA and people not knowing how to wear masks properly, I wanted something that was comforting and familiar. Luckily, Han Dynasty was close by and made me feel better after a long and arduous day. \n\nI had been here once before for a conference, but getting the experience living in the city is quite different. For now, it's either pick up or delivery, and it was nice to see that they were very cautious, and only allow people wearing masks to pick up food. I ordered some of the usual sichuan dishes, such as mapo tofu, water boiled beef, twice cooked pork, and string beans. After sampling almost every sichuan restaurant in my previous city of Houston, I can say that Han Dynasty can stand with the best. The mapo tofu has a wonderful texture, it wasn't broken up, and actually uses the right style of tofu. Water boiled beef had a great flavor, just enough sichuan peppercorn, and wasn't too greasy. The twice cooked pork was also really good, but it was half leeks and less meat than I would expect. String beans were cooked perfectly, just how I like it.\n\nThe price isn't terrible for the location, but it is more expensive than I am used to. Then again, I am new to the city so my needle has to probably change a bit. If you're already familiar with the dishes and are ordering online, it can be a bit confusing, since they go by \"style\". I would have also liked to have some more rice with my food. I ordered 4 dishes and only got 2 little to go containers of rice, which felt a bit skimpy.\n\nOverall, this is going to probably be my new local. The flavor is great, resonably priced, and does an excellent job of protecting their customers and staff.\n\nPS, if you haven't yet, the owner is featured on Munchies video by Vice."

If you were going to charge me $8.95 for a side of sauce than I would have ordered the actual appetizer for $6.95!!! I don't think that was right and feel really cheated!

Culinarily I don't think that makes one a good chef if you have to use so much oil for flavor. But that's just me. Having said that, there are so many good options here that are tasty and not spicy at all. The bok choy side dish is simple but so so good! The lo mein is cooked perfectly, the won ton soup is not too salty, and the dry fry style pork (as hot and spicy as it is!) is bite-after-bite crunchy perfection. If you do get the dry fry style pork, be aware that you will want extra rice to soak up some of the spice. \n\nThe service is also just average. For a place that's supposed to be more upscale, I wasn't impressed. They don't check in on you enough and I found the hostesses at the front to be aloof and not friendly. It wasn't completely terrible which is why I've been back to dine here multiple times. My husband had his college graduation lunch here and they were able to accommodate his family; we were a party of 10. \n\nThis is a great place to have a dinner date and it is definitely a step-up above most food in University City but I would say it is a bit over-hyped and overpriced."

The server came with an open bottle of Rose', my SO pointed this out to him and he apologized and this time brought the unopened bottle of Prosecco and had us check. He poured the flutes and dropped some, used my napkin to wipe and said I will get you another. (He was probably new so we didn't mind). \nWe proceeded to order the food and decided on getting 2 apps and 2 entrees. \nWe had just about finished 2 sips of the Prosecco when our entree's were placed on the table.

We ended up canceling our order and he mumbled something as he hung up the phone. \n\nThe price discrepancy was apparently across every item. A total bill went from $49.35 to over $62 before tax.\n\nThis is a great example of a business that is uninterested in serving the customer or rectifying their own mistake. They seem ok losing business due to inconsistency or concern for customer satisfaction."

Buuuuut I get it. It's really freakin' hard to judge the levels. Because there's my Indian friend who's laughing at the 8 spicy level and then there's my mixed European friend who's dying at spice level 3. So I get it. \n\nAfter much spice calibration, I have a fondness for this place. I may be the only person alive who doesn't pine for the dan dan noodles or the spicy crispy cucumbers (both tasty items, but not reason why I crave the place). I think their strongest suit is their tasting menu. You can \"choose your adventure\" i.e. be adventurous or not, and you can get it for as low as $20 per person. The pricier it gets per person, the more fun food you get. And you can specify things like spice level, or mostly seafood, or please no tripe etc etc. Which I think is a lot of fun. They only do it for groups though, but it's fun on someone's birthday to know what the flat price everybody is paying and then just share everything. Love it!"

I took my family there when they visited me in college, and they said this is one of the best Chinese food restaurants they had and the food tasted even better than the ones we cook at home, which is a huge compliment. I think if you like a good amount of spice, but there are also lots of non-spicy options. The service is really fast, and you get seated pretty quickly as people shuffle in and out. All and all definitely a solid, can not go wrong option, but I don't think it's outer worldly good.

        "text": "Han Dynasty used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I have been going there since they first started in Old City and only had one location. The food was always good and consistent, although a little pricey for Asian food. It was one of the very first to introduce and popularize szechuan-style food to the Philadelphia area. However, in recent years and on my most recent visit to their University City location, I'm not sure that I will continue to be a regular. \n\nI am not sure if it was the particular chef at this location, if they have Americanized their dishes, or simply changed the recipes, but I no longer enjoy the many dishes I used to love. The Dan Dan Noodles, Spicy Crispy Cucumber, and the Tea Smoked in Beer Sauce taste very different. The noodles and the cucumbers are much more sweet than before. I find that although they are still spicy, the sweetness overpowered any spiciness in the dish. It was still good, but as far as authenticity and overall taste, it was not what it used to be. \n\nAdditionally, the smoked duck WAS ALL BONES! There never was that much meat on the duck itself, but this time it seemed like they tore off all the meat on the duck and used it for another dish and gave us the leftovers. For $18.95, this is a rip-off. The flavor is good, but not enough to compensate because the rest of the dish is just filler ingredients. \n\nThe cucumber used to be coated and soaked in chili oil, but now it is in a creamy, spicy/sweet sauce. The taste is weird and strange. \n\nI might give it another chance, at least at the Old City location, but is it one of my favorites still, not really."

This place is Szechuan style, meaning the food is SPICY. For the non-masochists out there, their non-spicy plates are delicious too! Our party of 20 came for a $25/person tasting menu on a busy Saturday night which consisted of numerous dishes. I eventually lost count as the plates streamed to our table and were passed around for everyone to share. There was plenty of food for everyone to have a good portion.\n\nFor appetizers, I remember the Pork Belly, Scallion Pancakes, Wontons in Chili Oil, Dan Dan Noodles, and Cold Sesame Noodles. The scallion pancakes and noodle dishes remind me of home - just like how mom makes them. The other appetizers are pretty spicy, and they are great if you can handle the heat.\n\nFor entrees, I remember the Black Bean Style Beef, Dry Fry Style Pork, and Double Cooked Style Fish. Black Bean Style Beef reminded me of \"Pepper Steak & Onion\" which is an order at a typical chinese-american take out places, but the black bean sauce at Han Dynasty is far better than the sauce from a take out place. Not a spicy dish at all. The Dry Fry Style Pork consists of shredded pork and tons of sichuan peppercorns which leave your tongue numb. The Double Cooked Fish is a fried fish, not very spicy and delicious. Entrees are served with plenty of white rice in a futile attempt to help soothe your burning tongue.\n\nService needs improvement though. Our waitress was around, but she just kind of had a non-chalant personality. She didn't put much effort into explaining the tasting menu. We also waited an hour before we got our appetizers. Then we waited another hour before we got our entrees. It was a busy night, and there were several other parties doing the tasting menu, but an hour wait between food seems a bit excessive. I would expect bad service from a place in Chinatown, but I had much higher expectations for service from Han Dynasty in Old City. \n\nBesides the service, the only other thing that could have improved our experience is if we had a round table large enough for our entire party and a lazy susan to spin our food around (which is a sign of a true authentic Chinese restaurant).\n\nOVERALL: Despite the bad service, Han Dynasty is getting four stars for great value - good prices for quality and quantity of food."

This place also has a decent cocktail list. They close at 10 on weeknights, but if you come anywhere close to that (we arrived at 930), be prepared to be rushed out and reminded a few times that the kitchen closes at 10. I get the \"end of the night\" feeling as an eating establishment with staff that wants to go home (I remember my days of working in a restaurant and hoping the place is empty by closing) but it is a bit unnerving when the order is put in a half hour before the kitchen closes and it feels like you just ruined the lives of everyone that has to serve you food. It might have been because we were end -of -the -evening customers, with end -of -the -evening -food, but while the flavor and heat on my dry pepper fish was good there were more than a few pieces that were inedible. I'm not sure if they were fried too hard or were the bony tail of the fish but I couldn't even chew through them. I pushed them to the side of my plate and kept it rolling. Our server himself, was gracious and quick with a smile, which was refreshing. I don't regret stopping through.

I have been to both the U City and Old City locations -- food was equally good at both. Whenever I have family/friends visiting they are always asking about this place and I find myself always going back. Plan to call ahead of time to avoid the wait because this place is popular!"

The interior of this one is a lot better, it is more spacious, and you can opt for outdoor seating as well.\n\nI would recommend getting the braised beef noodle soup, Taiwanese fried rice and chinese cabbage were all delicious and remind me of home. Other dishes I am planning to try are chicken in chili oil, hot sauce style fish and  the cumin lamb. I had tried them in the Old City location, and they were pretty tasty. I don't see it being any different here. I would probably steer away from the scallion pancake and dumplings here if you were looking for something super authentic. The scallion pancake didn't have the right texture and flavor. The dumplings were also a little doughy - too thick for my liking. \n\nAlso, if you are worried that you can't handle the spice, you can always ask them to make it less spicy.My friend who doesn't eat any spicy food at all have no problem finding food she likes here (Taiwanese sausage fried rice and beef noodle soup).

The food, the service, the speed, the drinks, the food again!\n\nEverything about the Han Dynasty experience screamed 5 stars for me. First, the staff here needs to be commended or awarded with some kind of prize, collectively or as individuals. The service here is really beyond anything I would ever expect at any restaurant. Not only are they constantly filling my water glass and refreshing my cocktail, they are right on the money with recommendations and the food comes out at lightning speed. Extra props to the kitchen on that one too! \n\nWhen the food comes out like a bullet from a gun, it is not only piping hot, but unearthly delicious. The Dan Dan Noodles, Szechuan fries, Chili Dumplings, Dry Pepper shrimp, Crispy Rice with Chicken, Tofu Hot Pot, the list goes on and on.  The spice designations are a fun and helpful way to navigate the menu, though it should be known you can adjust the spice level on any dish to suit your tastes. We take most everything down to a 4, though I think we've gone as high as a 7! The best part is no matter how spicy something is here, the flavor comes through and wins the day.\n\nI have never gotten something I didn't love at Han Dynasty.

No leaks or spills and they send reusable containers which is great. Save the planet! They are my go-to Chinese spot whenever I have a craving. 9/10 would recommend."

The dishes and flavors are consistent within and across locations. \n\nToday I ordered an app and two entrees: Spicy Crispy Cucumber, Dry Pepper Fish, and Double Cooked Chicken. The cucumbers are a great starter - super refreshing and crunchy, low heat, and delightfully sweet. I would eat bowls and bowls of rice with the sauce they prepare with the cucumbers - it's THAT good!\n\nI like to experiment with different combinations of styles and proteins each time I visit Han Dynasty. The fish was superb - the fish were both seasoned well and the batter was super crunchy. I felt the spicy rating of an 8 for dry pepper was a bit high for this dish, the fish was more mild in spice. The chicken was super tender and moist (white meat) and I really enjoyed the almost sour and spicy flavor profile of the double cooked style. \n\nThe service was very attentive and friendly making sure that we were getting our food promptly and very apologetic when the orders were being held back. We had to wait a tad bit longer for our second entree, which was my only criticism. Otherwise, Han Dynasty is still a fav in my book (and stomach)!."

It was refreshing and had a nice kick to it. \nDan dan noodles: did not like this at all. The noodles were cooked right and probably would have been good had it not been for them dumping what tasted like an entire jar of peanut butter over them. The first bite was okay but no one was able to eat more than a couple bites of them. Seriously guys, ease up on the peanut sauce (aka Jif peanut butter).\nSchezwan curry chicken: not bad\nChicken dry pot: I actually liked this one. It was very spicy and the chicken in it was very tender. I just wish it had more chicken in it.\nBetween 4 of us we would usually easily finish the amount of food we ordered but there was plenty of leftovers.

One of the best dishes I've had at Han Dynasty was something another person in my party ordered and then couldn't actually eat due to the spice. It was, indeed, very very spicy and also very, very delicious.\n\nMore recently though, the spice levels went down... by a lot. Last time I visited, I ordered a Dry Pepper Style entr\u00e9e that's listed as an 8/10 on the spice scale, and found that it was barely spicy. Tonight, I ordered a Dry Pot Style entr\u00e9e--supposedly a 10--and it was, to me, at most *mildly* hot.\n\nMy friends disagreed with my assessment that the food was not spicy, but they didn't think it was searingly hot either. And everything we ordered was 7-10 so it really should have been. And look, ok, I suppose I do have a pretty high spice tolerance but I've had food here that I'd consider hot--just years and years ago. Based on my more recent experiences I can't imagine anyone other than my very Eastern European grandmother being unable to eat the level 10 dishes.\n\nIf we could award half-stars I'd give the place 3.5, because heat level aside, it was an enjoyable meal. The service was just ok--not very attentive considering it was a quiet night. But the food was tasty and the sauces were very nice. Still, if I wanted a mild, enjoyable meal, I could get that almost anywhere."

This was slightly disappointing on this visit.   It came out first and right away.  Unfortunately, it was tepid at best, like it was intended for another table (since our server told us our dumplings would come out first followed by everything else).\n\nThe wontons in hot chili oil also had a garlic paste at the bottom.  It was good but it is the first time we had them like that.   A bit extra heat.\n\nKung pao chicken is the standard order for one of us and it was not particularly spicy even though it rated a spice level of 3.\n\nThe three cup chicken, a standard for my other dining partner, was excellent here as as well.   \n\nI enjoyed the shredded pork with pressed tofu.

The scallion pancakes were great once toasted as they don't retain the heat from delivery. Loved the home style tofu, a great option for vegetarians and it comes with generous amounts of the fried tofu that is steaming with heat and flavor. The dan dan noodles are average--it's better to remix it when you get it as the sauce tends to sink to the bottom. Han didn't give any chili oil for the noodles, but I find that the noodles are much better with a bit of chili oil and vinegar. Another dish that I love is the garlic style tofu, which is pressed tofu in garlic sauce with veggies. Overall, Han Dynasty is a solid restaurant and the portions are large!"

We sat outside last time and tonight we sat inside, right next to the bar. The bar is beautiful and well stocked. The tea is a nice touch and both times my boyfriend and I stayed after paying just to enjoy the tea. The servers were very attentive and often checked in on and refilled water classes whenever we were running low, which is something that a lot of servers seem to overlook. \n\nOn our first visit, we ordered the chicken lo mein and the dry pot style chicken. Both were ordered at a spice level of 10, although we suspect that our waiter put them at a lower spice level because we ended up having to ask for extra chilli oil. Aside from the spiciness, however, both the noodles and the chicken were great. There were a lot of bugs and mosquitos around (we sat outside) and I was paranoid about one of them landing in the food so instead of eating seconds, we just took the rest to go. Needless to say, the food was quickly eaten later than night..\n\nThis time around, we got an all vegetarian meal. We ordered the vegetable fried dumplings, the vegetable lo mein, and the garlic sauce style tofu all at a spice level of 10, once again. The dumplings were yummy and we both ate three quite quickly. But the noodles and the tofu- phew. This time, for whatever reason, the spice level was MUCH more intense than the last. It was definitely spicy! I, personally, loved it because the spicier the better, but my poor boyfriend couldn't get past a couple bites (even though he can eat very spicy food, usually). My advice would def be to pay attention to the spice levels- a ten is definitely a ten... or at least it was this time around. lol \n\nIt is a bit more pricey for chinese but honestly, this is the only chinese place in university city that I actually can see myself craving so I guess its just something that I'll have to deal with. (As a price reference, the three things we got tonight ended up costing around 32 bucks.)\n\nOver all, a solid four star place that you should check out if you want spicy chinese thats much, much better than any other chinese place in University City."

I was thoroughly impressed by the quality of food samples that were provided and even more impressed at their ability to make your eyes water from their spice blend!\n\nAfter this initial encounter, my person and I decided to try other options offered through the menu and Han Dynasty did NOT disappoint. There are a number of dishes I would recommend besides the Dan Dan Noodles, like: Spicy Crispy Cucumbers, Dumplings in Chili Oil, and the Kung Pao Style Chicken. What's great about this place is that you can either crank up the heat or simmer it down from the default spiciness of each dish, which is denoted by a red number by each item on the menu! But beware, this place is certainly not like other places and their spice blend forces you to drink a gallon of water to cool down your taste buds. Those that enjoy the heat, start with a 7 and work your way up! Those who don't, I would stick to a 3 or lower!"

        "text": "Han Dynasty, you disappointed me this weekend. I have been to the Old City location, the University City location, and the New York location. I would definitely give the NYC location 4 stars but my experience at the University City location two nights ago warranted a solid 3 stars, which is disappointing.\n\nI remember  coming here a lot two/three years ago when the location first opened. It was so hyped and definitely lived up to it. Happy hour drinks were delicious and cheap. Food was high quality. Service was respectable. I'm really not sure what happened since then.\n\nWe had a group of 11 Friday night, which led to us sitting at one of the large round tables in the back. I've sat there before and have had no problems, but service was EXTREMELY bad when we went. The restaurant was also not packed or filled at the time, which is why I consider it to be totally inexcusable. We were always out of tea / water and our food took so long. We ordered two orders of Dan Dan noodles, one order of cold sesame noodles, dry fry style pork, kung pao chicken, scallion style beef, garlic style chicken, and black bean style beef. I had to ask the waiter multiple times to check on our food. Our original waiter was so incompetent and in the middle of waiting for our food another waitress started serving us.\n\nThe one piece of advice for food I have is to NOT order the garlic style unless you like bamboo. Shit was naasty. The dish came out incredibly orange looking and the taste of bamboo was sooo strong (and I hate hate hate bamboo... I failed to read the instruction and assumed it'd be... garlic? Not a stockpile of bamboo shoots?) and I personally just hated it.\n\nThe meal came out ridiculously cheap because we had such a large group and didn't order that much. It was around $11 a person since we ordered so little. We ended up just eating plain rice between dishes because they were coming out so slowly so that's probably why...\n\nIn New York, I often order 2 dan dan noodles and 3-4 dishes between only two people (almost way too much food for two), which totals up to around $40/person, which is on the expensive side for sure, so this was a nice change to only pay $11.\n\nIf you can get past the mediocre service though, the food is very authentic and most dishes are delicious!"

When it came, it felt like the same amount of time had gone by since my first order. The dish was devoid of flavor and my spice level was in the negative; it came as a three, I asked for a five. I ate it anyway because I was so hungry. \n\nWhen the check came, my dish was incorrect and a few dollars more than what I asked for. The same server apologized again and brought me the correct check. \n\nAfter paying, I chatted with the manager about the situation. He offered a halfhearted apology saying that they are without a head chef and that was the cause of the day's unfortunate events. I was particularly upset that because of them I ate meat.

We ordered the scallion pancake ($3.95) and beef tendons in chili oil ($9.95) for appetizers.  The scallion pancake was fairly standard and unremarkable.  The beef tendons in chili oil - my wife was quite proud of how far I've come in terms of openness to different food (I'm at \"level 2 ordering\") - were really good. \n They are super thin with a little chew, and really soak up the chili oil to make for a fairly spicy dish (it was the spiciest dish we had, although it is not going to come close to the actual spice levels we had in China).  \n\nFor entrees, we ordered the dry pot style with pork entree ($15.95) and the crispy rice style with chicken entree ($14.95), as well as the bok choy with black mushrooms ($12.95).  The dry pot style was the star of the show - really bold flavors, and the pork was very tender.  We kept the spice level at 10, which really ended up being only a medium spice level.  But still excellent flavor, and the mini wok it is served in is great presentation (and keeps the dish warm).  The crispy rice style is always fun to eat because the rice has a nice chew to it, and can really soak up the sauce.  It was slightly too sweet for my liking, but the chicken was also very tender and the dish complemented the dry pot style pretty well.  The bok choy with black mushrooms is also a bit of a sweeter dish, but it was cooked well and the mushrooms were plump with great flavor.  We also ended up getting a free cumin style with tofu entree by accident, which ended up being a freebie (who am I to say no?).  The tofu was a bit too dry, but great strong cumin flavor on the dish (and I'm not complaining because we were not charged).  \n\nService: We had to wait 5 minutes for a table, which made no sense because there were a ton of tables open.  But once we got seated, our server was great.  He also was really nice to box up the leftovers for us (and even threw in some extra rice).  Overall very good service.\n\nSpace and pace: Huge interior with really tasteful decor.  It was mostly filled with students (no shock, given the location) but I think it is also a fine place to bring a date or family.  Definitely on the list of places for when my mother-in-law visits."

They also have spacious indoor and outdoor seating. The service was good, and they have a plethora of menu items accompanied by a 1-10 spice scale for spicy dishes to help you decide what to eat. The dan dan noodles were 6 on the spice scale, and I could handle them with just a bit of water, thanks to my gochujang (Korean spicy red paste) training. The noodles, which come with minced pork, were incredibly flavorful and satisfying to eat. You know that spicy food is good when the heat makes you want even more despite any pain you might feel, and Han Dynasty's dan dan noodles meet that requirement. The portion was also a large amount! I finished about 4/5 of the serving on my own for dinner; it's very worth the price!\n\nI tried the $7 Chicken Fried Dumplings appetizer, which consists of 6 small dumplings and soy sauce. The dumplings were good, but skippable and not that worth it. I recommend coming in a group of 3 or more people, sharing two dan dan noodle orders per every 3 people, and trying some of their meat and/or vegetable family-style dishes!\n\nHan Dynasty blew me away; by far, they offer the best dan dan noodles I've ever had.

Although I had only been here about twice during my time at Penn, I still remembered how good all of the dishes were and especially the dan dan noodles (definitely get these!). The experience did not disappoint, and the restaurant seemed quite full on a Tuesday evening. I had the dan dan noodles as well as the lamb cumin style, both of which were terrific. I would say that the spiciness levels may have been dampened down a bit for western tastes as I didn't think I was tasting a 6 or 7 out of 10 (both of which my dishes were purported to be). If I get the opportunity to come back to Penn again, you know I will be here!"

In my opinion, it used to be the best szechuan places in West Philly. However in the past 1 year, their spice level has reduced a lot. I tried by specifically requesting to have a very high spice level for dishes which are already rated 10, but it still ended up to be very bland. While I understand that it might be in an effort to match with the spice level of other people, I will expect to have the previous spice level on requests. Currently I am going to the Han at Old City whenever I am having a craving of Szechuan as their dishes still provide the kick that I love, but since I work at UPenn, the one at University City is more accessible. Han at University City, are you listening?"

Tip for Lunch: Noon-1pm is super crowded. Come earlier or later.\n\nEverything at Han has a number on its spicy scale. My server was great, and she immediately asked what I could handle, and described the spiciness as a \"Sriracha-type spicy\". I would love if you could get a Han t-shirt with a spicy number on it! I'm a 6! I'm an 8!\n\n- Dan Dan Noodles- 8 Spicy (my server pronounced it \"Don don\")\nExcellent! Does contain small amounts of pork, not sure if you can get it vegetarian friendly. This noodle bowl was enough for a meal, for sure, and very spicy.\n\nStill, I had to try an entr\u00e9e too, on my short visit to Philadelphia. \n\n- Double Cooked Style chicken (4 Spicy), with leeks, hot peppers, fermented black beans, and chili oil. My server suggested Double Cooked as her favorite, so I went with it. It was good, but not super amazing. Cumin Style may have been more up my alley. \n\nThey have a great drink and beer selection, and I ordered the Oskar Blues Dale's Pale Ale simply to cut through some of the spiciness. (Ha, right!)

Possibly because a friend had talked it up and we didn't realize it only was for the spicy dry entrees...\n\nThree of us ordered Spicy Beef Noodles. Now, generally speaking, beef noodles and beef noodle soup does not come in a bowl of chili oil. It's in a soy sauce-based soup with some chili paste or chilis. Our noodles were drenched in oil, and it was disgusting. Sure, I read the Chinese and it said \"Szechuan beef noodles\" but nowhere on the menu did it say \"will arrive in a BOWL of chili oil.\" Two of my friends asked to switch to the other soup, but still, the noodles were slick in oil and slimy. \n\nThen there was the \"Crispy Rice style.\" Excuse me, what crispy rice? The dish arrived with vegetables soaked in cornstarch and sauce on top, so obviously the rice at the bottom was no longer crispy when it arrived on the table. The vegetables and pork were covered in a super vinegary sauce - it was so sour that there was no \"sweet,\" as mentioned on the menu.\n\nAnd the final horror - the order of dumplings. I have never even seen dumplings that looked as terrible as they tasted. These? Gods forbid I ever have to even see it. One bite and my friend was done with the dumplings. \n\nThe only decent dish was a friend's spicy dry pepper style, because it's hard to mess up fried chicken when half the dish is chili peppers.\n\nNone of these dishes had any complexity of flavor you'd find in a proper Szechuan (or any style of regional Chinese) restaurant. These dishes were even worse than most American-Chinese takeout foods. Even Panda Express tastes better than the horror show we were presented with."

We had heard countless students in University City hype this place up and tell us how great the Dan Dan Noodles and other menu items were.\n\nWe had made a reservation ahead of time, and we came in at the time of it and were seated promptly. Once we had placed our orders of 'Chicken Dumplings' and 'Dan Dan Noodles,' we waited to receive our food. Upon trying the 'Dan Dan Noodles ,' me and my 2 other friends were grossed out by the flavor. With a description of having peanut sauce, this seemed like something we were interested in. However, the noodles tasted more like straight peanut oil, and they left a very sticky residue on the tongue. \n\nAlthough it was kind of awkward, we were able to have our waited take them back, and take our new orders for us. Upon waiting for our new orders of 'Garlic Sauce Style' chicken, we were served our dumplings, which were mediocre at best. They tasted kind of like packaged ones that I buy at the grocery store.\n\nA manager of some sort came up to us to ask about what we didn't like about the 'Dan Dan Noodles,' which I appreciated but also felt bad about.\n\nOnce our main dishes of 'Garlic Sauce Style' chicken came out, they were SO salty. I just felt like I was eating thin strips of chicken with so much salt and garlic. \n\nAlthough I came in with high expectations, I'm so sad to say that none of the food even lived up to average quality. I do feel bad saying this, because I know many fans of the restaurant. The customer service was also decent. \n\nSorry, but due to the prices and quality of the food, I definitely wouldn't come again.

Plentiful portions packed with so much heat, they were fine examples of how spicy hot food can be quite enjoyable. I've had the Dan Dan Noodles here before and recommended it to Robert. He and Ingrid loved the dish. Ground bits of pork, peanut sauce, and chili oil. So simple and yet so addictive. My Spicy Beef Noodle Soup tingled my lips with its exotic flavor that was equally as addictive as the Dan Dan Noodles. The beef and tendon chunks were very tender. I just wish there was more meat. The Taiwanese Sausage Fried Rice was the most ordinary of the three, but it was like the superior quality fried rice you get at Chinese weddings. \"This is one the best meals I've had in my entire life,\" Robert admitted. \"Even better than our wedding?\" Ingrid challenged. \"It's right up there with that,\" he replied.

Also, a gem located among the specials is the three cup chicken: both sweet and savory and prepared in a hot bowl so it stays warm.\n\nMy only regret with Han Dynasty is that I have never made it to its happy hour.

Good news, the spicy cucumbers still has not failed to disappoint :)  And therefore, I still love dipping the scallion pancakes into it.

MF and I got the Scallion Style Lamb (stir fried in hoisin and oyster sauce with onions, scallions, and your choice of meat).  Though the sauce itself was good, the meat did not taste like lamb.  When we asked the server just to make sure, she was kind of cold about it.  Lamb has a distinct flavor, and this tasted pretty much like beef.  Sometimes I would get a hint of lamb.  So, if you want the Scallion Style, do not get the lamb.  You are paying extra money for something that tastes essentially like beef.  I'm not saying they're lying or being dishonest, but it's just weird.    \n\nThe drinks were ok.  We got some sort of punch that had coconut creme in it and it was quite blah for $9.

And I have been to Han Dynasty's before and this one in particular, several times. I don't think I have ever had a meal I would rate less than \"fair\" and most of the food I have had there I would rate \"good\".\n\nSo why the low rating? Simply because the meal I received tonight was awful. I don't feel entirely well after eating it, I'm suspicious of MSG poisoning. I said nothing about holding MSG so this is on me. But putting my feeling unwell aside, the food was just hopelessly mediocre. Soggy oily string beans, dried out odd tasting and nagging home style tofu, and seriously mediocre and salty chicken with scallions. Just wow. Not what I expected."

This dish was a highlight from my recent takeout order and I can't wait to order it again. The perfect amount of sweet and savory flavors, tenderness, and garlic.\n\nI was in the mood for soup so I ordered a beef noodle soup from Han Dynasty for pickup. While looking through the other menu options online, I noticed the Three Cup Chicken in the specials section. I decided to try it. Based on the way the menu describes the items, I could not tell if this was going to come with rice or not. I assumed (and hoped) it would, and it did. You just never know with takeout these days!\n\nI scheduled it for a later pickup time, ran my errands, and stopped by a few minutes earlier than expected for my food. While it wasn't ready when I got there (100% my fault) they did get it wrapped up quickly and I did not have to wait long. By the time I got home everything was still hot and VERY delicious."

Han Dynasty is the latter.  \n\nI've eaten the entire menu, many times over, never in one sitting but this is one of the rare restaurants that I go that I force myself to order something different every time.  It is all good.  Of course there's always the favorites that I have to get (most of them packed into delis for a late night snack, breakfast and lunch the next day).  \n\nDan Dan Noodles and Scallion Pancakes are a must have.  And if you're going to eat them there, order seconds to take home.  There is nothing better than a bowl of Dan Dan with a side of Scallion pancakes; you'll thank me later.  \n\nMy ultimate though is the hot pot, super spicy, with chili oil on the side.  The heat from the chili oil hurts so bad it's good...too bad When Harry met Sally it wasn't in Han Dynasty.  Then the sichuan peppercorns kick in with their insane numbing effects on your tongue and lips.  Your body doesn't know what to do, worry about the heat or the fact that your lips are vibrating like a quarter operated bed in a cheap motel.  Yes, the hot pot is my ultimate pleasure."

I have to preface my review, that after this visit for Chinese, which seems to be the best of the best, I just don't like the cuisine. It's not something I'm drawn too if I had the choice.\nThat being said, husband and I came in here with my parents in tow for lunch last week.  The staff was uber friendly and our sweet waitress helped navigate us through the menu. The red numbers indicate the level of 'hotness' she proclaimed, but any dish can be customized to your liking.  She also put the disclaimer that if things get to hot, sip on tea and eat more rice, don't drink water! She suggested the Dan Dan noodles, after numerous recommendation from fellow yelpers, we took the plunge.  I have to say they were nice, which just the right about of heat, left a warm tingle on the tongue and not swimming in old as the rest of the dishes we had. We had the dumplings in chili oil which as the name suggested was very oily.  We also ordered the veggie dumplings since the spicy was a tad bit too much for my parents, they liked the light dough pillow puff stuffed with cabbage and not doused in sauce.\nFor entrees, which arrived at our table as soon as they were cooked, I had the dry pot style, spicy level taken down to a 6, I was a bit disappointed since I assumed that it would as hot as the Dan Dan, but it seems there is a slight variance in the rating system. The dish was pretty at first glance but my protein selection (beef) was scarce, and I had to pick through the rest to find it.\nHusband had the Dry Pepper Style taken down to a 7 and subsquently asked for more chili oil since he claimed that it wasn't hot enough. His dish again was lacking on the beef with an overabundance of peppers. My parents had the scallion style of beef which had no heat, and the ratio for chicken to veggie looked better balanced, again, swimming in sauce.\nI should have went with the chalkboard special and gone all out for the Szechuan lobster, she said it was two WHOLE lobsters prepared  Szechuan style with something. something (she lost me after two whole lobsters) but I thought that would be too much for lunch, although upon leaving, an order was being presented to the table behind us and I did all I could to not drool over the platter, it was beautiful!!\n\nThe staff was very friendly, however we had a hard time trying to get someone several times to clear our finished dishes, we actually sat them on the counter across from us. None of us were bowled over by anything that we ate but it wasn't a bad lunch, but I'm going to go against the general consensus and give her a luke warm reception."

Their food is family style so they give large servings that are meant to be shared. \n\nI always order the fish dry pot with level 10 spicyness and it is delicious!! They bring the dish out in a pot with a candle underneath so your food will remain warm. The only downside to this is that the serving size is pretty small. \n\nThe fish is cooked perfectly and it's so soft it basically melts in your mouth. They used to include a larger variation of vegetables with the fish but now it's mostly bamboo and mushroom that's edible. If you want to get the whole experience, I highly recommend getting the level 10 spicyness because you may tear up but the flavors are worth it. \n\nI have also tried the garlic sauce style tofu and chicken. It is just as good as it looks and they give a huge plate. It's basically bamboo, tofu/chicken, and mushrooms cooked in a thick reddish sauce. \n\nThe chicken fried rice is better than most places and once again, it's a huge serving. It does have plenty of veggies and chicken. \n\nI would not recommend getting the cold sesame noodles though.

It is so efficient and consistent. I have never had a bad experience at Han. The Dan Dan Noodles and double cooked chicken are my favorite things on the menu. You have to try those if you go. If you like spicy food and are feeling adventurous, I would recommend taking it up to at least a spice level 7 to really enjoy it. They got lots of space so feel free to bring a big party.

First, sadly, I have the unfortunate responsibility of making those of you who weren't aware that the generous Yelp offer of free spicy crispy cucumbers (default spice level of 6) is no longer available.  That didn't dissuade me from ordering it; glad I did because they were very tasty.  The spice was significant but I could've handled a 7 or possibly even an 8.  \n\nOf course, I had the dan dan noodles as well.  There's nothing I can add to what other Yelpers have said other than it's a definite \"must get\".  This comes with a default spice level of 7 but, just as with the cucumbers, I could've stood even more.\n\nSilly me, dining solo I was unaware of the portion size so my initial thought to follow those orders with an entree went straight out the window.  But there's always next time.\n\nTaking full advantage of the Happy Hour prices, a Victory pale ale draft was a great choice as its crispness paired awesomely with the spice of the food.  Water refills were thankfully abundant.\n\nService was near perfect.  My server explained the spice scale but not at all snootily and my food came out within five minutes.  He mentioned that a 2 is on par with Tabasco sauce which I thought is a great way to educate customers prior to ordering.\n\nThat recaps my first visit.

The Dan Dan noodles are a personal favorite (any every one else agrees), the Bok Choi is a great add on and I have yet to dislike any entree.\n\nThe service is pretty standard.  As I like to say, if you didn't notice it was bad, then it was good.  Also, the food comes somewhere between an ideal pace and fast.  \n\nThe Old City location is a bit more enjoyable ambiance than the U City one.  Things are dim, but the decorations and furnishings are nice.  It's slightly less accommodating to large groups, but YMMV.  \n\nI think the prices are pretty reasonable.  Entrees range from 15-20 dollars but are meant for more than one person.  It's hard to say if it's a good deal, but the food is still excellent.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nOne issue I find is that it's hard to push the issue on spiciness.  I've grown to really enjoy some heat and it's hard to get servers to really let the chef kick it up a notch.  \n\nThe other issue is that I often don't feel super great the next day after eating.  Maybe that's the spices or my amateur palate or the several cocktails I had.  \n\nConclusion:  I return because it's reliable and delicious.  I will continue to return.

The staff is friendly, the service is fast, and the food is generally very good. I made my most recent trip last night and once again left satisfied, though some dishes were better than others.\n\nThe standouts: Dan Dan noodles, dry pepper fish, string beans with minced pork, and the tea smoked duck in beer sauce. I don't think I've ever eaten at HD without ordering the first three, and for good reason-- the noodles were perfectly cooked, the fish was well-seasoned, and the string beans were delicious while allowing us to pretend we were being healthy because vegetables = always healthy. None of us had ever ordered the duck before, but it was smoky and tender.\n\nNot bad but not great: Dry pepper chicken and the hot sauce style beef. The dry pepper chicken had good flavor, but was more bread than chicken. The hot sauce beef actually had a good portion of meat, but the flavor was unremarkable.\n\nAvoid: Wontons in chili oil. These were soggy and a bit sour. I only managed to eat half of one (and they were not very big). Definitely the least popular dish at our table.\n\nIf you want to experience the family style dining at HD, I'd recommend going for lunch, as the menu is basically the same but significantly cheaper (generally when I've gone for lunch I pay under $20...dinner last night was $33). Also, they can adjust the spice level if you don't like spicy food, though I should mention that everything we ordered yesterday was at least an 8 on the spice-meter but we found nothing spicy (caveat: I'm Nigerian and my 3 dinner mates are Chinese, thus we're all quite used to *very* spicy food...so experiences may vary).

When the new one opened up in University City, I was ecstatic because I could now enjoy all the spicy Szechaun goodness anytime, even in my pajamas (still haven't attempted though).\n\nUpon stepping in, you definitely feel like you're in a different place. The interior is a lot more modern, more industrial looking than its sister branch. The servers, with their obnoxious \"10\" on their backs (representing the spicy scale they use on their menu), are just as attentive, but not as knowledgeable. Our server didn't know if certain dishes were vegetarian or not, or what type of tea they were serving. My friend and I opted for the Cold Chili Oil Noodles and Dry Hot Pot Style Chicken.\n\nThe cold noodle is probably one of my favorite dishes in the place. So simple, but so delicious. The combination of red chili oil, minced garlic, and a soy sauce mixture really opened our taste buds and is still on my list of favorites. It was my first time trying their dry hot pot style anything and while it's still not on my list of favorites, it was indeed tasty. The presentation is pretty cool: the dish is served on top of a propane-lit mini-stove at the table. The spiciness level wasn't quite where I like it, but the chicken was very tender and the combination of veggies made for a great pairing with rice (which we of course got seconds of).\n\nStill a fan of Han Dynasty, but I'm pretty picky with food and I'm not sure if this new location steps up to the challenge. Next time I'm looking for a date spot, I might trek down to Old City. But if I'm craving some cold noodle or stopping by for happy hour (their menu/drink specials looked very appealing), the UC location will do just fine.\n\nPros: location, attentive of service, interior, serves alcohol\nCons: not quite the same as original, new staff\n\nDishes to try (my overall Han favorites): Cold Chili Oil Noodles, Wontons in Chili Oil, Dry Pepper Style Chicken, Peppercorn Fish Tofu Stew"

When I first visited Han dynasty I thought the food was going to be more Americanized because of the modern ambience, but they actually taste like what I'd eat at an authentic Asian hole in the wall, except much cleaner and a bit more pricey. For the quality of the food and the great atmosphere, this place is top notch."

If you don't like Han Dynasty, it is because some ridiculous childhood trauma has rendered you soulless and dead inside.\n\nYou can be assured that every dish I mention in this review is a favorite. Here's how to do Han Dynasty right, based on countless experiences with varying numbers of people at this restaurant-\n\n\"The Lonely Man\"(for one lonely, sad person)\nDan Dan Noodles, dumplings in chili oil. You will have leftovers.\n\n\"The Basic\"(for two people, probably a date early in the relationship)\nDan Dan Noodles, Spicy Cucumber, Three Cup Chicken - You will have leftovers.\n\n\"Company\"(for three people, because your significant other has someone visiting from out of town and you want them to like you)\nDan Dan Noodles, Spicy Cucumber, Double cooked pork belly, Fried Taiwanese sausage.\n\n\"The Party\"(for four people, because three folks from your work are tired of hearing about you rave about the restaurant and have demanded that you take them.)\nDan Dan Noodles, Spicy Cucumber, Dry Pepper Shrimp, Fish hot pot\n\nAny party greater than 4 usually means that someone with Han Dynasty experience will be in the party and should know what the hell they are doing.\n\nThe U.City location is larger and serves the food more quickly than any other location. Seriously, they are really fast here. I've eaten here and received my Dan Dan noodles and cucumbers before the drinks arrive. It is ridiculous.\n\nI've given so many stars to Han's restaurants on Yelp that this chain might as well be its own group of constellations. Google \"han dynasty rap\" for more of my shameless plugging of this restaurant."

There are no pictures because we inhaled it all as soon as we opened the containers.\n\nStarted with scallion pancakes. Honestly, I was never about ordering them as a takeout appetizer and I was right. They don't travel well. Not a fault of Han, but just a fact.\n\nWe split an order of Dan Dan Noodles. They are an always order often added without asking the other person. \n\nI ordered the Chicken Dry Pepper Style entree . It's a heat level 8 so it's hot, but I like that. My boyfriend ordered the Beef Garlic Sauce Style which is a heat level 3 (perfect for him!)\n\nWe are thankful that Han Dynasty was open on Christmas Eve and appreciate all of their hard working employees!"

Each time we've come here, our meal has been around $15-$20 per person which is definitely worth it for how good the food is and how full we leave. \n\nDishes we got this time:\nEggplant with garlic sauce: so much flavor in the sauce and very meaty, really enjoyed eating it with rice. \nThree cup chicken: Everyone's favorite--a sweet and salty flavor, would recommend this above everything else. \nWontons in chili oil: Not a huge fan of this, probably wouldn't get it again because it was a bit sour and I like chili oil wontons to be more sweet and spicy. \nDry pot chicken and hot sauce style chicken: Honestly not a huge fan of this either but I'm just not inclined toward super spicy things in general. My friends liked it though. \nScallion pancakes: I liked it better last time we ordered because this time it was very oily so this dish seems to be hit or miss. \n\n\nOverall, food is amazing. The service can be a bit slow and it took a while for our food to come out."

I made the mistake of taking some home as left overs just so I can have more later... but that was a bad idea.  The cucumbers for soft and it shriveled up. Spicy cucumber is definitely something you  should just indulge in and not look back.  I LOVE the sauce.  Sometimes I have cucumbers lying around, so when I get it as a take out and have left over sauce, I just chop up some more and toss it in.  The sauce is so delectable.  Also, I love using the spicy cucumber sauce as dipping sauce for the scallion pancakes.  \n\nI also enjoy the spicy beef noodle soup.  The broth is light, and is great for the winter time.\n\nDan-dan noodles is a must.  Short and sweet - it's a must.\n\nThe mapo tofu was only okay - but it's most likely because I can't stand Hunan beans.  If you don't like Hunan beans either, try asking if it's possible to make it without.  \n\nI didn't really like the salt-pepper squid.  The squid was a bit mushy in texture - which was strange to me.  There's nothing wrong with the flavor, but the texture freaked me out.  Just the texture..\n\nEvery time I have been here the service has been great.  Everyone is so nice and friendly, helpful, and attentive."

They have the only Fried rice that doesn't require you to douse it in soy sauce. So good and flavorful! Now those spring rolls? I'll pass on buying those again. They were super small. I mean they could fit in a kid's hand and bland. Not worth the $5 price tag..Nor were the Dumplings. The small box had 4 dumplings for $8 and just weren't very good.  \n\nI won't count them out but the experience of dining in here is just so much better.

The higher the number, the spicier it is! I typically get the lunch specials but this time I ate a little late and I got the normal portion- it's so much! There's two of us and the portion is more than enough! We finished the kung pao chicken (it's my favorite) and had leftovers that I brought back. I highly recommend getting the normal portion if you're eating with a large group! Service is also pretty quick and you can refill as much as rice when you dine in. They are also very accommodating as the serve you both iced water and hot tea (which I prefer)."

Without knowing much about the restaurant, I was practically dragged here against my will. I'm sure you can only imagine my surprise and delight once I found out this was not an Americanized-Chinese take-out restaurant. I mean, one assumes the worst when it's near college campus, right?\n\nMy friends did the ordering. I didn't know it at the time, but they ordered the dishes that every Yelper raves about. Among the dishes we ordered, I absolutely loved the Spicy Crispy Cucumber! I could not stop eating them. When our waiter brought it over, they didn't particularly look special, but boy, was I wrong. The sweet and spicy sauce was so addictive - I poured some over the rice and ate it together too (so good!)\n\nWhile the food was amazing, the service was not as impressive. Everything was very rushed. The moment we were seated, our waiter walked over and asked about our drink order. Obviously, we had to ask him to come back in a couple of minutes because none of us had a chance to look at their drink menu. Similar things happened when we were done with certain dishes/plates. Our waiter was really keen on taking the finished dishes away from our table.. except they weren't completely done. Like when he took my cucumber dish away - yes, I did eat all the cucumbers, but I still needed the sauce! The least he could have done was ask! He didn't even ask beforehand whether he can take it away. So yeah, I died a little inside as I saw my beloved cucumber dish being taken away.. :( but I'll be back for more!"
