        "text": "So glad to have this new option in university city for Chinese food! (most other alternatives serve greasy, overly saucey Chinese food)\n\nShanghai Station's entrance is down a flight of stairs and the restaurant itself is situated under a hairdresser / subway. Nara used to be there, known for their sake bombs and drunken college nights (or so I've heard); Shanghai Station seems to want to keep up the drinking part of it, heavily advertising their drink specials and with a darkish interior decor interspersed with disco-y lights. Wasn't expecting too much of the food, especially since they seem to be, as a restaurant, more focused on their alcohol selection, but I was so pleasantly surprised with their food.\n\nTo preface my later comments about service of the restaurant and for context: we came in a huge group of 20 people. We ordered the pork soup dumplings (\u5c0f\u7c60\u5305), the crab meat soup dumplings, Dan Dan noodles, Chinese broccoli, broccoli with beef, shrimp fried rice, scallion pancakes and crystal shrimp. \n\nHighlights: \nPork soup dumplings - they were absolutely delicious! Each order comes with 6 dumplings, and it came out steaming hot. My usual pet peeve with these kinds of dumplings (and I'm pretty picky with them because I was spoiled with good food in Hong Kong) is when they have super thick dumpling skins. It was not the case with these - the wrappers were delicate and thin, holding the hot, rich soup that spurts out when you bite into them. Would highly recommend! My only complaint would be that they didn't bring out the vinegar dipping sauce with this dish, but make sure you ask for it because a soup dumpling would not be complete without a dash of vinegar and thin ginger strands.\n\nCrab soup dumplings - basically same as above, but with a distinct crab flavor. \n\nDan Dan noodles - they used a softer type of noodle to make this dish compared to the usual type, and I have mixed feelings about it. Taste was solid though, but I'd suggest going to the Sichuan restaurants if you really crave the authentic type of Dan Dan noodles.\n\nChinese broccoli - this type of vegetable (\u82a5\u862d) is probably one of my favorite types of vegetables, and it bears little resemblance to broccoli, so the name might be confusing. It's lightly saut\u00e9ed in garlic, nothing too fancy but really good. Serving size is a little small though! \n\nService - the soup dumplings came out pretty quickly, but we waited a long long time for the other dishes. We were in a huge group and they just opened, so I wouldn't hold it against them too much. Throughout the meal the servers were also pretty good at refilling water during the wait. \n\nAll in all, a good, affordable option for some good Chinese food! Definitely get the soup dumplings, the crystal shrimp / broccoli with beef were alright but I'd recommend trying other dishes since they have a pretty expansive menu!"

This would have been a 5-star review if it had not been for how I was misled regarding the cost of the karaoke room.\n\nI made a reservation two weeks in advance over the phone. The rate is $150/hour, supposedly including unlimited food and drink off the menu. But when I got there, it turned out to not be a flat rate at all. There is no deal here -- my party's orders were taken, only for the wait staff to pull me aside and say that we exceeded a supposed $300 limit (since we had the room for two hours). We could pay the excess if we wanted, but I was blindsided by this and the wait staff helped me get it down to $300. I was very disappointed that the room policies were not better communicated to me, much less listed on the website or social media."

From there, there's also a karaoke room which had pretty up to date music when going through the music selection. \n\nThe food variety is a lot of Chinese food you'd typically expect but they also have some more Americanized appetizers and they also have Sczaun and Dim Sum as well. The good thing about this Dim Sum menu is they have 4 variations of Soup Dumplings which is everyone's favorite. I ended up getting the Shanghai Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings and Shanghai Crabmeat and Pork Soup Dumplings with a friend. \n\nWe ended up getting the Shrimp with Walnut and the Jumbo Shrimp with Chilli Pepper. The walnut shrimp is exactly what you'd expect which is one of my favorite things to order when available. The jumbo shrimps are pretty huge and are spicy but not to the point where you can't finish it because it's too hot. Food was presented well, tasted great and most importantly(for me) filled me up leaving me satisfied. I'll def be here again for Soup Dumplings and to try new things on the menu.

Then threatened us physically and kept making phone calls to \"get his brother on us.\" Then 2 of his female friends tried to start a physical fight and pursued us for a block as we attempted to leave the situation, as they kept egging on my bf to fight them. Very sad and unfortunate. Can't support a business that allows this kind of behavior. The owner shrugged it off as well. Very gross and it was very unnecessary. I have never been treated this way in my entire life. Not sure if the bartender was drunk, but that doesn't excuse this behavior. He was passing out free drinks to EVERYone in the bar right in front of us but had the audacity to be upset we didn't tip him more than a dollar for ONE drink and then try to get all patrons (his family and friends) to fight us while the owner hid somewhere (he didn't speak good english and seemed scared to intervene).

We got seated right away since there weren't many people at the time. The waitress was very nice and prompt in taking our order. We ordered pork soup dumplings, kung pao chicken with hand drawn noodles, and chili cabbage shredded pork noodles. We were super hungry so were happy to see the food come quickly (under 10m). For some reason, all the dishes came in the noodle soup form. I'm not sure if that's how it was supposed to come or there was some miscommunication during ordering. The soup dumplings were super hot and a little difficult to eat, but I blame my lack of soup-dumpling-eating skills for that. They they were delicious. The same can be said about the cabbage dish though the soup broth was a little low on spice (but not flavor) for my taste. But then again, I like really spicy things. Kung pao was also very delicious and was spicy enough to bring me to tears (yes, that's the way I like it). The waitress was always around to ask if we needed anything. In the end, she brought us the check upon asking. We had some leftover kung pao which she very skillfully poured into a takeout container in front of us, without spilling even a drop of the delish soup. Upon being complimented for her superior pouring skills, she told us that she was trained to do this during  her job at a pho restaurant. Way to go! \n\nAnyway, the overall experience was great, food was cheap and delicious. Portions are decently sized. One appetizer and two entrees were more than enough food for two really hungry people. I would definitely recommend this place to people, specially living in university city, looking for good Chinese food. Soup dumplings are a must, so don't miss out on those."

I'm really happy there's a new option for Chinese food around University City, especially for soup dumplings!! Wasn't sure what to expect but left the place pleasantly surprised! The food was great, the service we generally good, and the owner of the place was extremely nice when we inquired about any birthday accommodations.\n\nThe entrance to the place is down some stairs next to a subway, but the interior of the restaurant was very nice and impressive. There was a bar near the entrance, followed by a dining area as well as a karaoke room next to the dining area. The menu comes with a lot of options similar to Dim Sum Garden in Philly's Chinatown, with some dim sum options and various rice/noodle, meat, and vegetable dishes. \n\nWe had a reservation for a party of seven, and we ordered four plates, with two orders of the pork soup dumplings (number 1). We had the fried rice cake, two of the beef with chili pepper, and a kung pao chicken. For dessert we ordered one of the rice ball in sweet soup. The flavors of all the dishes were great and all the meats were very tender. The soup dumplings were what you would expect from any Shanghai restaurant, so they were delicious and soupy. Finally the dessert was pleasant, though the portion was only enough to give everyone a small bowl of the rice balls.\n\nWe were seated right next to the karaoke room, so sometimes the atmosphere got really loud, but I didn't seem to mind it as much. The food came out really quick, and we were in and out of the restaurant within an hour or so. I should note that every meat dish ordered comes with a bowl of rice, and that any additional bowls of rice cost $1.50 extra. Finally, we asked about birthday accommodations, and the owner (I believe he was the owner) offered us some free drinks to celebrate the birthday, so they gave us some nice lychee cherry bombs, which I was really happy about.\n\nOverall, would definitely visit this place again for the food and the dining experience (even just for the soup dumplings). Glad they are now a part of the University City dining area."

The menu is not super large but has a nice variety; lots of dim sum/appetizer options with all sorts of dumplings, rice plates, noodles, meats, and vegetable dishes. \n\nWe started with crab and pork soup dumplings. They were pretty yummy, but the soup filling was a little sour and could've been more flavorful, definitely a step down from Dim Sum Garden's soup dumplings. We got a large wonton soup, which was also just alright. For our entree we got dry pepper chicken, which tasted great, and had just the right amount of crispiness. However for what we paid, there definitely should've been more meat; about two thirds of the plate was just fried chinese peppers. We needed a little more so we got a plate of sauteed bok choy- pretty good but again, nothing to write home about.\n\nWas hungry a couple days ago so came back with a friend to get some takeout; we ordered hot and sour soup, scallion pancake, and shanghai stir-fried noodle with chicken. The hot and sour soup was a bit too vinegary, and the scallion pancake too oily. I thought the noodles were sort of generic-tasting; they tasted pretty good but in a hole-in-the-wall Chinese fast food way. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming back if I want quick, convenient food.
